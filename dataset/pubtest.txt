BACKGROUND	This study analyzed liver function abnormalities in heart failure patients admitted with severe acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) .
RESULTS	A post hoc analysis was conducted with the use of data from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE ) .
RESULTS	Liver function tests ( LFTs ) were measured at @ time points from baseline , at discharge , and up to @ months follow-up .
RESULTS	Survival analyses were used to assess the association between admission Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding International Normalized Ratio ( MELD-XI ) scores and patient outcome.There was a high prevalence of abnormal baseline ( admission ) LFTs ( albumin @ % , aspartate transaminase @ % , alanine transaminase @ % , and total bilirubin @ % ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of patients with abnormal LFTs decreased significantly from baseline to @-months ' follow-up .
RESULTS	When mean hemodynamic profiles were compared in patients with abnormal versus normal LFTs , elevated total bilirubin was associated with a significantly lower cardiac index ( @ vs @ ; P < @ ) and higher central venous pressure ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable analyses revealed that patients with elevated MELD-XI scores ( @ ) had a @-fold ( hazard ratio@ @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) increased risk of death , rehospitalization , or transplantation after adjusting for baseline LFTs , age , sex , race , body mass index , diabetes , and systolic blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	Abnormal LFTs are common in the ADHF population and are a dynamic marker of an impaired hemodynamic state .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated MELD-XI scores are associated with poor outcomes among patients admitted with ADHF .

BACKGROUND	Minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) could be a surgical technique that improves outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( rAAA ) .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of EVAR compared with standard open repair ( OR ) in the treatment of rAAA , with costs per @-day and @-month survivor as outcome parameters .
METHODS	Resource use was determined from the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm ( AJAX ) trial , a multicentre randomized trial comparing EVAR with OR in patients with rAAA .
METHODS	The analysis was performed from a provider perspective .
METHODS	All costs were calculated as if all patients had been treated in the same hospital ( Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis , teaching hospital ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were randomized .
RESULTS	The @-day mortality rate was @ per cent after EVAR and @ per cent for OR : absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) @ ( @ per cent confidence interval ( c.i. ) -@ to @ ) per cent .
RESULTS	At @months , the total mortality rate for EVAR was @ per cent , compared with @ per cent among those assigned to OR : ARR @ ( -@ to @ ) per cent .
RESULTS	The mean cost difference between EVAR and OR was @ ( @ per cent c.i. -@ to @,@ ) at @days and @,@ ( -@ to @,@ ) at @months .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per prevented death was @,@ at @days and @,@ at @months .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in quality of life between EVAR and OR .
RESULTS	Nor was EVAR superior regarding cost-utility .
CONCLUSIONS	EVAR may be more effective for rAAA , but its increased costs mean that it is unaffordable based on current standards of societal willingness-to-pay for health gains .

BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that individuals with social anxiety demonstrate vigilance to social threat , whilst the peptide hormone oxytocin is widely accepted as supporting affiliative behaviour in humans .
METHODS	This study investigated whether oxytocin can affect attentional bias in social anxiety .
METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , within-group study design , @ healthy and @ highly socially anxious ( HSA ) male volunteers ( within the HSA group , @ were diagnosed with generalized social anxiety disorder ) were administered @ IU of oxytocin or placebo to investigate attentional processing in social anxiety .
METHODS	Attentional bias was assessed using the dot-probe paradigm with angry , fearful , happy and neutral face stimuli .
RESULTS	In the baseline placebo condition , the HSA group showed greater attentional bias for emotional faces than healthy individuals .
RESULTS	Oxytocin reduced the difference between HSA and non-socially anxious individuals in attentional bias for emotional faces .
RESULTS	Moreover , it appeared to normalize attentional bias in HSA individuals to levels seen in the healthy population in the baseline condition .
RESULTS	The biological mechanisms by which oxytocin may be exerting these effects are discussed .
CONCLUSIONS	These results , coupled with previous research , could indicate a potential therapeutic use of this hormone in treatment for social anxiety .

BACKGROUND	Exposure to diesel exhaust causes inflammatory responses .
BACKGROUND	Previous controlled exposure studies at a concentration of @ g/m ( @ ) of diesel exhaust particles mainly lasted for @ h.
BACKGROUND	We prolonged the exposure period and investigated how quickly diesel exhaust can induce respiratory and systemic effects .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy volunteers were exposed twice to diluted diesel exhaust ( PM@ ~ @ g/m ( @ ) ) and twice to filtered air ( PM@ ~ @ g/m ( @ ) ) for @ h , seated , in a chamber with a double-blind set-up .
METHODS	Immediately before and after exposure , we performed a medical examination , spirometry , rhinometry , nasal lavage and blood sampling .
METHODS	Nasal lavage and blood samples were collected again @ h post-exposure .
METHODS	Symptom scores and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) were assessed before exposure , and at @ , @ , and @ min of exposure .
RESULTS	Self-rated throat irritation was higher during diesel exhaust than filtered air exposure .
RESULTS	Clinical signs of irritation in the upper airways were also significantly more common after diesel exhaust exposure ( odds ratio = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	PEF increased during filtered air , but decreased during diesel exhaust exposure , with a statistically significant difference at @ min ( +@ L/min vs. -@ L/min , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Monocyte and total leukocyte counts in peripheral blood were higher after exposure to diesel exhaust than filtered air @ h post-exposure , and a trend ( p = @ ) towards increased serum IL-@ concentrations was also observed @ h post-exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	Diesel exhaust induced acute adverse effects such as symptoms and signs of irritation , decreased PEF , inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects were first seen at @ min of exposure .

OBJECTIVE	A pharmacokinetic substudy was conducted within a phase @ clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of two leuprolide acetate @-month depot formulations in children with central precocious puberty ( CPP ) , where the pharmacokinetics of leuprolide and the exposure-response relationship between leuprolide concentration and the probability of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) suppression were assessed .
METHODS	Children diagnosed with CPP ( N = @ in each dosing cohort ) , who were treatment nave or previously treated , received a total of two intramuscular injections of either leuprolide acetate depot @ or @ mg formulations administered @ months apart .
METHODS	Serial blood samples were collected for leuprolide concentration determination in a subset of subjects ( N = @ in each cohort ) .
METHODS	One-way analysis of covariance was used to assess dose proportionality .
METHODS	The probability of LH suppression ( peak-stimulated LH concentrations < @ mIU/mL ) exposure-response relationship was modelled using repeated measures logistic regression .
METHODS	The predicted probability of LH suppression and the corresponding @ % confidence interval at the mean leuprolide concentration of each dose group and at each time of measurement were computed .
RESULTS	Mean leuprolide concentrations between weeks @ and @ for @ and @ mg doses were relatively constant and dose proportional , with no accumulation of leuprolide upon repeated administration .
RESULTS	Body weight and age were not found to be significant covariates on leuprolide pharmacokinetics .
RESULTS	Higher leuprolide concentrations were associated with higher probability of LH suppression and both doses provided LH suppression levels < @ mIU/mL .
CONCLUSIONS	Leuprolide pharmacokinetics were characterized for @ and @ mg @-month depot injections .
CONCLUSIONS	An exposure-response model was developed to link leuprolide concentrations and probability of peak-stimulated LH suppression .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether alcohol consumption is causally associated with cognitive impairment in older men as predicted by mendelian randomization .
METHODS	Retrospective analysis of a cohort study of @,@ community-dwelling men aged @ to @ years followed for @ years .
METHODS	Cognitive impairment was established by a Mini-Mental State Examination score of @ or less .
METHODS	Participants provided detailed information about their use of alcohol during the preceding year and were classified as abstainers , occasional drinkers , and regular drinkers : mild ( < @ drinks/wk ) , moderate ( @-@ drinks/wk ) , heavy ( @-@ drinks/wk ) , and abusers ( @ drinks/wk ) .
METHODS	We genotyped the rs@ GA variant of the alcohol dehydrogenase @B ( ADH@B ) gene , which is associated with lower prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence .
METHODS	Other measures included age , education , marital status , smoking and physical activity , body mass index , diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular diseases .
RESULTS	At study entry , rs@ GA polymorphism was associated with lower prevalence of regular use of alcohol and decreased consumption among regular users .
RESULTS	Six years later , @ men ( @ % ) showed evidence of cognitive impairment .
RESULTS	Abstainers and irregular drinkers had higher odds of cognitive impairment than regular drinkers ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @-@ @ , after adjustment for other measured factors ) .
RESULTS	The rs@ GA polymorphism did not decrease the odds of cognitive impairment ( AA/GG OR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; GA/GG OR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Alcohol consumption , including heavy regular drinking and abuse , is not a direct cause of cognitive impairment in later life .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results are consistent with the possibility , but do not prove , that regular moderate drinking decreases the risk of cognitive impairment in older men .

BACKGROUND	Detoxification with psychosocial counseling remains a standard opioid-use disorder treatment practice but is associated with poor outcomes .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the efficacy of a newly developed psychosocial intervention , Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training for Treatment Retention ( CRAFT-T ) , relative to psychosocial treatment as usual ( TAU ) , for improving treatment outcomes .
METHODS	A randomized , @-week trial with follow-up visits at @ and @ months post-randomization conducted at two substance use disorder ( SUD ) treatment programs .
METHODS	Opioid-dependent adults ( i.e. , identified patient - IP ) enrolled in a residential buprenorphine-detoxification program and their identified concerned significant other ( CSO ) was randomized to CRAFT-T ( n = @ dyads ) or TAU ( n = @ dyads ) .
METHODS	CRAFT-T consisted of two sessions with the IP and CSO together and @ with the CSO alone , over @ weeks .
METHODS	TAU for the CSOs was primarily educational and referral to self-help .
METHODS	All IPs received treatment as usually provided by the SUD program in which they were enrolled .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to first IP drop from treatment lasting @ days or more .
METHODS	Opioid and other drug use were key secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	CRAFT-T resulted in a moderate but non-significant effect on treatment retention ( p = @ , hazard ratio = @ ) .
RESULTS	When the CSO was parental family , CRAFT-T had a large and significant effect on treatment retention ( p < @ , hazard ratio = @ ) .
RESULTS	CRAFT-T had a significant positive effect on IP opioid and other drug use ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CRAFT-T is a promising treatment for opioid use disorder but replication is needed to confirm these results .

BACKGROUND	Characterization of the variations in the metabolomic profiles of elderly people is a necessary step to understand changes associated with aging .
BACKGROUND	This study assessed whether diets with different fat quality and supplementation with coenzyme Q@ ( CoQ ) affect the metabolomic profile in urine analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy from elderly people .
METHODS	Ten participants received , in a cross-over design , four isocaloric diets for @-week periods each : Mediterranean diet supplemented with CoQ ( Med + CoQ diet ) ; Mediterranean diet ; Western diet rich in saturated fat diet ; low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-@ polyunsaturated fat .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis showed differences between diets when comparing Med + CoQ diet and saturated fat diet , with greater hippurate urine levels after Med + CoQ diet and higher phenylacetylglycine levels after saturated fat diet in women .
RESULTS	Following consumption of Med + CoQ , hippurate excretion was positively correlated with CoQ and - carotene plasma levels and inversely related to Nrf@ , thioredoxin , superoxide dismutase @ , and gp@ ( phox ) subunit of NADPH oxidase gene expression .
RESULTS	After saturated fat diet consumption , phenylacetylglycine excretion was inversely related to CoQ plasma level and positively correlated with isoprostanes urinary level .
CONCLUSIONS	The association between hippurate excretion and antioxidant biomarkers along with the relationship between phenylacetylglycine excretion and oxidant biomarkers suggests that the long-term consumption of a Med + CoQ diet could be beneficial for healthy aging and a promising challenge in the prevention of processes related to chronic oxidative stress , such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease .

BACKGROUND	The management of recurrent malignant pleural effusions ( MPE ) can be challenging .
BACKGROUND	Various options are available , with the most efficacious and widely used being talc pleurodesis .
BACKGROUND	Talc can either be applied via a chest drain in the form of slurry , or at medical thoracoscopy using poudrage .
BACKGROUND	Current evidence regarding which method is most effective is conflicting and often methodologically flawed .
BACKGROUND	The TAPPS trial is a suitably powered , multicentre , open-label , randomised controlled trial designed to compare the pleurodesis success rate of medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage with chest drain insertion and talc slurry .
METHODS	@ patients with a confirmed MPE requiring intervention will be recruited from UK hospitals .
METHODS	Patients will be randomised ( @:@ ) to undergo either small bore ( < @Fr ) Seldinger chest drain insertion followed by instillation of sterile talc ( @g ) , or to undergo medical thoracoscopy and simultaneous poudrage ( @g ) .
METHODS	The allocated procedure will be performed as an inpatient within @days of randomisation taking place .
METHODS	Following discharge , patients will be followed up at regular intervals for @months .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure is pleurodesis failure rates at @months .
METHODS	Pleurodesis failure is defined as the need for further pleural intervention for fluid management on the side of the trial intervention .

BACKGROUND	Reference values for plasma PTH assessment were generally established on small samples of apparently healthy subjects , without considering their @-hydroxyvitamin D ( @OHD ) status or other potential modifiers of PTH concentration .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to assess ranges of plasma PTH concentration in a large sample of adults , stratifying by @OHD status , age , gender , weight status , and calcium intake .
METHODS	This cross-sectional survey is based on @ middle-aged Caucasian adults from the Supplmentation en Vitamines et Minraux Antioxydants study ( @ ) .
METHODS	Plasma PTH and @OHD concentrations were measured by an electrochemoluminescent immunoassay .
METHODS	Extreme percentiles of plasma PTH concentrations were assessed specifically in subjects who had plasmatic values of @OHD of @ ng/mL or greater and @ ng/mL or greater .
RESULTS	Among subjects with @OHD status of @ ng/mL or greater , the @ th percentile of plasma PTH concentration was @ ng/L .
RESULTS	By using this value as a reference , @ % of the subjects with plasma @OHD less than @ nmol/L had a high plasma PTH level , reflecting secondary hyperparathyroidism .
RESULTS	Among vitamin D-replete subjects ( @OHD status of @ ng/mL or greater ) , the @ th percentile of plasma PTH was higher in overweight/obese subjects ( @ vs @ ng/L among normal weight subjects ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The reference value for plasma PTH defined in this vitamin D-replete population was far below the value currently provided by the manufacturer ( @ ng/L ) and varied according to overweight status .
CONCLUSIONS	These results may contribute to improve the diagnosis of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and subsequent therapeutic indication .

METHODS	Participants ( n = @ ) were recruited to a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind crossover trial .
METHODS	The effect of @-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice was compared with @-wk intake of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice ( placebo ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was blood pressure assessed by measuring home blood pressure during the intervention and @-h ambulatory blood pressure on day @ of the intervention .
METHODS	Other outcomes included nitrate metabolism assessed by measuring nitrate and nitrite in plasma , saliva , and urine .
RESULTS	Relative to the placebo , @-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice resulted in a @-fold increase in plasma nitrite and nitrate , a @-fold increase in salivary nitrite , an @-fold higher salivary nitrate , and a @-fold increase in both urinary nitrite and nitrate ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , no differences in home blood pressure and @-h ambulatory blood pressure were observed with @-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in comparison with the placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	An increase in dietary nitrate intake may not be an effective short-term approach to further lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects .

BACKGROUND	The Oxymizer is a special nasal cannula that provides a higher luminal diameter in combination with an incorporated oxygen ( O@ ) reservoir .
BACKGROUND	It is assumed that a higher O@ concentration can be delivered breath by breath in order to increase oxygenation .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate the effects of the Oxymizer on endurance time in comparison to a conventional nasal cannula ( CNC ) .
METHODS	Forty-three patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , age @ @ years , FEV@ @ @ % pred . )
METHODS	and indications for LTOT were recruited during pulmonary rehabilitation for this cross-over study .
METHODS	After an initial maximal incremental cycle test , all patients performed @ cycling endurance time tests at @ % of their peak work rate ( twice with the Oxymizer and twice with a CNC , in reverse order ) .
RESULTS	The endurance time was significantly higher when patients cycled while using the Oxymizer in comparison to while using the CNC -LSB- @ @ vs. @ @ s ; between-group difference @ s ( @ % confidence interval @-@ ) , p < @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	In addition to a longer cycling duration , O@ saturation at isotime was significantly higher with the Oxymizer ( @ @ vs. @ @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , there was a positive correlation ( r = @ , p = @ ) between the O@ flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate test , showing greater improvements in favor of the Oxymizer in patients with a higher demand for O@ ( @ liters/min ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We show that O@ delivery via the Oxymizer is superior to a CNC with regard to endurance capacity and oxygenation during exercise in patients with severe COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	It seems that patients with a higher demand for O@ ( @ liters/min ) , in particular , may benefit more from the use of the Oxymizer .

BACKGROUND	While acute-phase antipsychotic response has been attributed to @ % -@ % dopamine D receptor blockade , the degree of occupancy for relapse prevention in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia remains unknown .
METHODS	In this secondary study of an open-label , @-week , randomized , controlled trial conducted between April @ and August @ , clinically stable patients with schizophrenia ( DSM-IV ) treated with risperidone or olanzapine were randomly assigned to the reduction group ( dose reduced by @ % ) or maintenance group ( dose kept constant ) .
METHODS	Plasma antipsychotic concentrations at peak and trough before and after dose reduction were estimated with population pharmacokinetic techniques , using @ collected plasma samples .
METHODS	Corresponding dopamine D occupancy levels were then estimated using the model we developed .
METHODS	Relapse was defined as worsening in @ Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Positive subscale items : delusion , conceptual disorganization , hallucinatory behavior , and suspiciousness .
RESULTS	Plasma antipsychotic concentrations were available for @ and @ patients in the reduction and maintenance groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Estimated dopamine D occupancy ( mean SD ) decreased following dose reduction from @ % @ % to @ % @ % at peak and @ % @ % to @ % @ % at trough .
RESULTS	In the reduction group , @ patients ( @ % ) did not demonstrate continuous D receptor blockade above @ % ( ie , < @ % at trough ) after dose reduction ; furthermore , @ patients ( @ % ) did not achieve a threshold of @ % occupancy even at peak .
RESULTS	Nonetheless , only @ patient met our relapse criteria after dose reduction during the @ months of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that the therapeutic threshold regarding dopamine D occupancy may be lower for those who are stable in antipsychotic maintenance versus acute-phase treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Positron emission tomography studies are warranted to further test our preliminary findings .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the prevalence of , risk factors for , and visual acuity ( VA ) correlations with outer retinal tubulation ( ORT ) seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD OCT ) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy .
METHODS	Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Patients with SD OCT images at weeks @ and @ in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials ( CATT ) .
METHODS	Participants in the CATT were assigned randomly to ranibizumab ( @ mg ) or bevacizumab ( @ mg ) treatment and to a monthly or pro re nata ( PRN ) injection-dosing regimen .
METHODS	A subset of eyes was imaged with SD OCT beginning at week @ .
METHODS	Cirrus @ or Spectralis @ volume cube scan protocols were used to acquire SD OCT images .
METHODS	Two independent readers at the CATT OCT reading center graded scans , and a senior reader arbitrated discrepant grades .
METHODS	The prevalence of ORT , identified as tubular structures seen on at least @ consecutive Cirrus B scans or @ consecutive Spectralis B scans , was determined .
METHODS	The associations of patient-specific and ocular features at baseline and follow-up with ORT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses .
METHODS	Outer retinal tubulations .
RESULTS	Seven of @ eyes ( @ % ) at @ weeks and @ of @ eyes ( @ % ) at week @ had ORTs .
RESULTS	Absence of diabetes , poor VA , blocked fluorescence , geographic atrophy , greater lesion size , and presence of subretinal hyperreflective material at baseline were associated independently with greater risk of ORT at @ weeks ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Neither drug nor dosing regimen were associated significantly with ORT .
RESULTS	The mean VA of eyes with ORT at week @ ( @ Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters ) was worse than the mean VA of eyes without ORT ( @ letters ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	At @ years after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD , ORTs are present in a substantial proportion of eyes .
CONCLUSIONS	We identified baseline features that independently predict ORTs .
CONCLUSIONS	It is important to identify ORTs because eyes with ORTs have worse VA outcomes than those without this finding .

BACKGROUND	Higher-risk patients may not receive evidence-based therapy because of limited life expectancy , which is a composite measure that encompasses many patient factors , including age , frailty , and comorbidities .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we evaluated the extent to which treatment care gaps can be explained by a difference in projected life expectancy .
RESULTS	An observational cohort study was conducted on acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in Ontario , Canada .
RESULTS	Projected life expectancy was estimated using actual survival data with extrapolation using proportional hazard models adjusting for important covariates .
RESULTS	The relationship between projected life expectancy with statins and reperfusion therapy was examined using generalized linear models .
RESULTS	Among the @ acute myocardial infarction patients , @ % were prescribed statins and @ % were treated with reperfusion therapy .
RESULTS	When projected life expectancy was < @ years , the likelihood of receiving either treatment declined progressively with reduction in life expectancy ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At the @th percentile of projected life expectancies , the likelihood of receiving a statin decreased by @ % ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ % ) , and acute reperfusion therapy decreased by @ % ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ % ) for each year decline in projected life expectancy .
CONCLUSIONS	Life expectancy of a patient strongly influences evidence-based treatment in acute myocardial infarction .
CONCLUSIONS	It was seen not only among patients with limited life expectancies but also among those with many years to live .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment care gaps may reflect clinicians ' synthesis about frailty and life-expectancy gains .

BACKGROUND	Preterm birth leads to an estimated @ % of neonatal deaths worldwide .
BACKGROUND	Our study analyses neonatal mortality risks among preterm births in rural Bangladesh .
METHODS	Trained community health workers ( CHW ) prospectively collected data between June @ and September @ .
RESULTS	Among @ livebirths , @ % were preterm ( delivered at < @ weeks gestation ) and almost half ( @ % ) of all neonatal deaths occurred among preterm babies .
RESULTS	Preterm babies who were born as the first child -LCB- -LSB- risk ratio ( RR ) @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @ , @ -RSB- -RCB- and in the poorest households -LSB- RR @ ; @ % CI @ , @ -RSB- were at higher mortality risk .
RESULTS	Birth and newborn care preparedness was associated with lower risk of mortality -LSB- RR @ ; @ % CI @ , @ -RSB- while preterm infants who had symptoms of infection -LSB- RR @ ; @ % CI @ , @ -RSB- or whose mother suffered antenatal complications -LSB- RR @ ; @ % CI @ , @ -RSB- were at higher mortality risk .

BACKGROUND	Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) for locally advanced breast cancer can improve operability and local disease control , there is a lack of reliable biomarkers that predict response to chemotherapy or long-term survival .
BACKGROUND	Since expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase-@ ( ALDH@ ) is associated with the stem-like properties of self-renewal and innate chemoresistance in breast cancer , we asked whether expression in serial tumor samples treated with NAC could identify women more likely to benefit from this therapy .
METHODS	Women with locally advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy , followed by four cycles of taxane therapy ( Arm A ) , or the same regimen in reverse order ( Arm B ) .
METHODS	Tumor specimens were collected at baseline , after four cycles , and then at surgical resection .
METHODS	ALDH@ expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with tumor response using Fisher 's exact test while Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival .
RESULTS	A hundred and nineteen women were enrolled into the study .
RESULTS	Fifty seven ( @ % ) were randomized to Arm A and @ ( @ % ) to Arm B. Most of the women ( @ % ) had ductal carcinoma and @ % had lobular carcinoma .
RESULTS	Of these , @ ( @ % ) achieved a pathological complete response ( pCR ) after NAC .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between baseline ALDH@ expression and tumor grade , stage , hormone receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor @ ( HER@ ) status and Ki@ index .
RESULTS	ALDH@ negativity at baseline was significantly associated with pCR ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The presence of ALDH@ ( + ) cells in the residual tumor cells in non-responding women was strongly predictive of worse overall survival ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , serial analysis of specimens from non-responders showed a marked increase in tumor-specific ALDH@ expression ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall , there was no survival difference according to the chemotherapy sequence .
RESULTS	However , poorly responding tumours from women receiving docetaxel chemotherapy showed an unexpected significant increase in ALDH@ expression .
CONCLUSIONS	ALDH@ expression is a useful predictor of chemoresistance .
CONCLUSIONS	The up-regulation of ALDH@ after NAC predicts poor survival in locally advanced breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the chemotherapy sequence had no effect on overall prognosis , our results suggest that anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be more effective at targeting ALDH@ ( + ) breast cancer cells .

OBJECTIVE	The ACOSOG ( American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ) Z@ ( Alliance ) study , a randomized , placebo-controlled trial , demonstrated that @ year of adjuvant imatinib prolonged recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) after resection of primary GI stromal tumor ( GIST ) .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine the pathologic and molecular factors associated with patient outcome .
METHODS	There were @ patients assigned to the placebo arm and @ to the imatinib arm .
METHODS	Median patient follow-up was @ months .
METHODS	There were @ tumor specimens available for mitotic rate or mutation analysis .
RESULTS	RFS remained superior in the imatinib arm ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; Cox model-adjusted P < @ ) .
RESULTS	On multivariable analysis of patients in the placebo arm , large tumor size , small bowel location , and high mitotic rate were associated with lower RFS , whereas tumor genotype was not significantly associated with RFS .
RESULTS	Multivariable analysis of patients in the imatinib arm yielded similar findings .
RESULTS	When comparing the two arms , imatinib therapy was associated with higher RFS in patients with a KIT exon @ deletion of any type , but not a KIT exon @ insertion or point mutation , KIT exon @ mutation , PDGFRA mutation , or wild-type tumor , although some of these patient groups were small .
RESULTS	Adjuvant imatinib did not seem to alter overall survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings show that tumor size , location , and mitotic rate , but not tumor genotype , are associated with the natural history of GIST .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with KIT exon @ deletions assigned to @ year of adjuvant imatinib had a longer RFS .

OBJECTIVE	Larger biopsy specimens or increasing the number of biopsies may improve the diagnostic accuracy of gastric epithelial neoplasia ( GEN ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracies between conventional and jumbo forceps biopsy of GEN before endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) and to confirm that increasing the number of biopsies is useful for the diagnosis of GEN.
RESULTS	The concordance rate between EFB and ESD specimens was not significantly different between the two groups -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) in JG vs. @ % ( @/@ ) in CG -RSB- .
RESULTS	On multivariate analyses , two or four EFBs significantly increased the cumulating concordance rate -LSB- coefficients ; twice : @ ( P = @ ) , four times : @ ( P = @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	But , the concordance rate was decreased in high grade dysplasia ( coefficient -@ , P = @ ) .
METHODS	One hundred and sixty GENs from @ patients were randomized into two groups and finally @ GENs in @ patients and @ GENs in @ patients were allocated to the conventional group ( CG ) or jumbo group ( JG ) , respectively .
METHODS	Four endoscopic forceps biopsy ( EFB ) specimens were obtained from each lesion with conventional ( @ mm ) forceps or jumbo ( @ mm ) forceps .
METHODS	The histological concordance rate between @ EFB specimens and ESD specimens was investigated in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Before ESD , the diagnostic accuracy of GENs was significantly increased not by the use of jumbo forceps biopsy but by increasing the number of biopsies .

METHODS	All patients will initially be treated with intravenous flucloxacillin , and will be evaluated after @-@ days .
METHODS	Those who have improved substantially ( defined as being afebrile , and having a lower cellulitis severity score ) will be randomized at day @ between additional @ days of oral flucloxacillin ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Treatment success is defined as resolution of cellulitis on day @ ( disappearance of warmth and tenderness , improvement of erythema and edema ) , without the need of additional antibiotics for cellulitis by day @ .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints are relapse rate ( up to day @ ) , speed of recovery ( using a cellulitis severity score until day @ , and VAS scores on pain and swelling until day @ ) , quality of life ( using the SF-@ and EQ-@D questionnaires ) and costs ( associated with total antibiotic use and health-care resource utilization up to day @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Inclusion is planned to start in Q@ @ .

BACKGROUND	Injection opioid use plays a significant role in the transmission of HIV infection in many communities and several regions of the world .
BACKGROUND	Access to evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders is extremely limited .
METHODS	HIV Prevention Trials Network @ ( HPTN @ ) was a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the impact of @ medication-assisted treatment ( MAT ) strategies on HIV incidence or death among opioid-dependent people who inject drugs ( PWID ) .
METHODS	HIV-negative opioid-dependent PWID were recruited from @ communities in Thailand and China with historically high prevalence of HIV among PWID .
METHODS	A total of @ participants were randomly assigned to either ( @ ) a @-year intervention consisting of @ opportunities for a @-day detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP/NX ) combined with up to @ sessions of behavioral drug and risk counseling -LSB- short-term medication-assisted treatment ( ST-MAT ) -RSB- or ( @ ) thrice-weekly dosing for @ weeks with BUP/NX and up to @ counseling sessions -LSB- long-term medication-assisted treatment ( LT-MAT ) -RSB- followed by dose tapering .
METHODS	All participants were followed for @ weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact .
RESULTS	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points , sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior .
RESULTS	At week @ , @ % of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with @ % in the LT-MAT ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Differences disappeared in the year after treatment : at week @ , @ % in ST-MAT and @ % in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses .
RESULTS	Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants receiving BUP/NX @ times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Continued access to BUP/NX may be required to sustain reductions in opioid use .

BACKGROUND	Medication use is a potentially modifiable risk factor for falling ; psychotropic and cardiovascular drugs have been indicated as main drug groups that increase fall risk .
BACKGROUND	However , evidence is mainly based on studies that recorded falls retrospectively and/or did not determine medication use at the time of the fall .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we investigated the associations indicated in the literature between medication use and falls , using prospectively recorded falls and medication use determined at the time of the fall .
METHODS	Data from the B-PROOF ( B-vitamins for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures ) study were used , concerning community-dwelling elderly aged @ years .
METHODS	We included @,@ participants with pharmacy dispensing records .
METHODS	During the @ - to @-year follow-up , participants recorded falls using a fall calendar .
METHODS	Cox proportional hazard models were applied , adjusting for potential confounders including age , sex , health status variables and concomitant medication use .
RESULTS	During follow-up , @,@ participants experienced at least one fall .
RESULTS	Users of anti-arrhythmic medication had an increased fall risk ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ ) compared with non-users .
RESULTS	Similarly , non-selective beta-blocker use was associated with an increased fall risk ( HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- ) , while statin use was associated with a lower risk ( HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Benzodiazepine use ( HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- ) , and antidepressant use ( HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- ) were associated with an increased fall risk .
RESULTS	Use of other cardiovascular and psychotropic medication was not associated with fall risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results strengthen the evidence for an increased fall risk in community-dwelling elderly during the use of anti-arrhythmics , non-selective beta-blockers , benzodiazepines , and antidepressant medication .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinicians should prescribe these drugs cautiously and if possible choose safer alternatives for older patients .

BACKGROUND	Patients with end-stage renal disease are at a high risk of adverse cardiovascular events .
BACKGROUND	Elevated level of homocysteine is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients .
BACKGROUND	There are some strategies for reduction of serum homocysteine level in these patients , including folate and vitamin supplementation .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of omega-@ supplementation on serum homocysteine level in patients on hemodialysis .
METHODS	In a randomized controlled trial , @ hemodialysis patients were assigned into two groups to receive omega-@ ( oral capsule , @ g/d ) or placebo for @ months .
METHODS	Complete blood count , blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine , serum lipids , and serum homocysteine levels were measured before the study and after @ months at the end of study .
RESULTS	Of @ patients , @ in each group were excluded , and @ patients in each group completed the study .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences regarding the age , sex , and the number of dialysis sessions per week between the two groups .
RESULTS	No difference was observed between the two groups in the laboratory investigations at the end of the study , except for a significant reduction in serum homocysteine level in the omega-@ group as compared to the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study showed a significant reduction regulated by omega-@ supplementation in serum homocysteine level which is a cardiovascular risk factor among hemodialysis patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Omega-@ can be considered as another homocysteine-reducing agent in this population .

BACKGROUND	Intra-articular corticosteroids are a mainstay in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis , and in clinical trials , they demonstrate a large initial analgesic effect that wanes over one to four weeks with the rapid efflux of drug from the joint .
BACKGROUND	The present study was undertaken to determine if FX@ , an extended-release formulation of triamcinolone acetonide , can provide pain relief that is superior to the current standard of care , immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide .
METHODS	In this Phase-@ , double-blind , multicenter study , @ patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis pain were randomized to a single intra-articular injection of FX@ ( containing @ , @ , or @ mg of triamcinolone acetonide ) or @ mg of immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide .
METHODS	Data on the mean daily pain on the @-point Numeric Rating Scale were collected over twelve weeks ; the primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline to each of eight , ten , and twelve weeks in the weekly mean of the mean daily pain intensity scores analyzed with a longitudinal mixed-effects model .
RESULTS	The @-mg dose of FX@ produced pain relief that was improved relative to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at two through twelve weeks , although the difference in pain relief was not significant ( p @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-mg dose of FX@ produced pain relief that was improved at two through twelve weeks and was significantly superior to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at five to ten weeks ( p < @ at each time point ) .
RESULTS	At the @-mg dose of FX@ , prespecified secondary analyses , including responder analyses and all Western Ontario and McMaster Universities subscales , were significantly superior ( p < @ ) to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at eight weeks , and the time-weighted mean pain relief ( assessed with mean daily pain intensity scores ) was significantly superior to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide over one to twelve weeks ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-mg dose did not provide additional improvement relative to the @-mg dose .
RESULTS	Adverse events were generally mild and similar across all treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Intra-articular injection of FX@ , an extended-release formulation of triamcinolone acetonide , provided a clinically relevant improvement in pain relief in patients with knee osteoarthritis relative to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide , the current standard of care .
METHODS	Therapeutic Level I. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence .

BACKGROUND	The MitraClip REALISM ( Abbott Vascular , Menlo Park , CA ) trial included several inclusion criteria to identify patients at high risk for conventional mitral valve ( MV ) surgery .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated contemporary surgical outcomes for high-risk surgical patients who met these defined criteria to serve as a benchmark to evaluate appropriateness in treatment allocation between surgical and percutaneous MV repair .
METHODS	A statewide Society for Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) database was queried for patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery over a @-year study period from @ different hospitals .
METHODS	Patients were stratified into high-risk ( HR ) versus non-high-risk ( non-HR ) cohorts based upon clinical criteria similar to those utilized in the REALISM trial .
METHODS	Mixed effects multivariable regression modeling was used to evaluate study endpoints including mortality , morbidity , and resource utilization .
RESULTS	Of @,@ isolated mitral operations , @ % ( n = @ ) were HR per REALISM criteria .
RESULTS	Median STS Predicted Risk of Mortality ( PROM ) for HR patients was @ % compared with @ % for non-HR patients ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The HR patients more commonly underwent MV replacement as well as urgent ( @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) operations .
RESULTS	High-risk patients incurred higher morbidity and mortality ( @ % vs @ % ) with longer intensive care unit ( @ vs @ hours ) and hospital stays ( @ vs @ days , all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Among REALISM criteria , STS PROM @ % or greater and high-risk STS criteria were the only criteria associated with mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Select REALISM criteria , including reoperation with patent grafts and functional MR with ejection fraction less than @ , may not identify patients truly at high risk of death with surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition to conventional STS criteria , risk assessment by surgeons is essential to direct appropriate treatment allocation for high-risk mitral disease .

OBJECTIVE	Identification of pretreatment patient characteristics predictive of psychotherapy outcome could help to guide treatment choices .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluates patients ' initial level of immature defense style as a predictor of the outcome of short-term versus long-term psychotherapy .
METHODS	In the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study , @ adult outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomized to individual short-term ( psychodynamic or solution-focused ) or long-term ( psychodynamic ) psychotherapy .
METHODS	Their defense style was assessed at baseline using the @-item Defense Style Questionnaire and classified as low or high around the median value of the respective score .
METHODS	Both specific ( Beck Depression Inventory -LSB- BDI -RSB- , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale -LSB- HDRS -RSB- , Symptom Check List Anxiety Scale -LSB- SCL-@-Anx -RSB- , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale -LSB- HARS -RSB- ) and global ( Symptom Check List Global Severity Index -LSB- SCL-@-GSI -RSB- , Global Assessment of Functioning Scale -LSB- GAF -RSB- ) psychiatric symptoms were measured at baseline and @-@ times during a @-year follow-up .
RESULTS	Patients with high use of immature defense style experienced greater symptom reduction in long-term than in short-term psychotherapy by the end of the @-year follow-up ( @ % vs. @ % ) .
RESULTS	Patients with low use of immature defense style experienced faster symptom reduction in short-term than in long-term psychotherapy during the first year of follow-up ( @ % vs. @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Knowledge of patients ' initial level of immature defense style may potentially be utilized in tailoring treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research on defense styles as outcome predictors in psychotherapies of different types is needed .

BACKGROUND	Serelaxin is a promising therapy for acute heart failure .
BACKGROUND	The renal hemodynamic effects of serelaxin in patients with chronic heart failure are unknown .
RESULTS	In this double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , multicenter study , patients with New York Heart Association Class II to III chronic heart failure , left ventricular ejection fraction @ % , and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) @ to @ mL/min per @ m ( @ ) received intravenous serelaxin @ g/kg per day or placebo for @ hours .
RESULTS	Primarily , we assessed the difference between serelaxin and placebo on renal plasma flow ( para-aminohippuric acid clearance ) and GFR ( iothalamate clearance ) over @ to @ hours .
RESULTS	All @ patients from @ clinical site were excluded from primary analyses before unblinding because of implausible measurements .
RESULTS	The primary analysis comprised @ patients , mean age was @ ( @ ) years , @ % were male , mean estimated GFR was @ ( @ ) mL/min per @ m ( @ ) , and @ % had New York Heart Association Class III symptoms .
RESULTS	Renal plasma flow increased by @ % with serelaxin and @ % with placebo ( @ % relative increase with serelaxin ; P = @ ) , whereas GFR changes did not differ significantly during @ to @ hours .
RESULTS	Filtration fraction increased by @ % with serelaxin and @ % with placebo ( @ % relative decrease with serelaxin ; P = @ ) during @ to @ hours .
RESULTS	Changes in systolic blood pressure were largely similar , and creatinine clearance did not differ between groups .
RESULTS	Adverse event rates were similar with serelaxin ( @ % ) and placebo ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with chronic heart failure , serelaxin increased renal plasma flow and reduced the increase in filtration fraction compared with placebo , but did not affect GFR .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest beneficial renal hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure .

BACKGROUND	Low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations experience disproportionate colorectal cancer ( CRC ) burden and poorer survival .
BACKGROUND	Novel behavioral strategies are needed to improve screening rates in these groups .
BACKGROUND	The study aimed to test a theoretically based `` implementation intentions '' intervention for improving CRC screening among unscreened adults in urban safety-net clinics .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Adults ( N = @ ) aged @ years , due for CRC screening , from urban safety-net clinics were recruited .
METHODS	The intervention ( conducted in @-@ ) was delivered via touchscreen computers that tailored informational messages to decisional stage and screening barriers .
METHODS	The computer then randomized participants to generic health information on diet and exercise ( Comparison group ) or `` implementation intentions '' questions and planning ( Experimental group ) specific to the CRC screening test chosen ( fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy ) .
METHODS	The primary study outcome was completion of CRC screening at @ weeks based on test reports ( analysis conducted in @-@ ) .
RESULTS	The study population had a mean age of @ years and was @ % non-Hispanic African American , @ % non-Hispanic white , and @ % Hispanic .
RESULTS	Those receiving the implementation intentions-based intervention had higher odds ( AOR = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) of completing CRC screening than the Comparison group .
RESULTS	Those with higher self-efficacy for screening ( AOR = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) , history of asthma ( AOR = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) , no history of diabetes ( AOR = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) , and reporting they had never heard that `` cutting on cancer '' makes it spread ( AOR = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) were more likely to complete CRC screening .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that programs incorporating an implementation intentions approach can contribute to successful completion of CRC screening even among very low-income and diverse primary care populations .
CONCLUSIONS	Future initiatives to reduce CRC incidence and mortality disparities may be able to employ implementation intentions in large-scale efforts to encourage screening and prevention behaviors .

OBJECTIVE	Increased utilization of online medical information seeking demands investigation of potentially detrimental effects of these activities .
OBJECTIVE	The present study investigated whether viewing medical websites may adversely affect anxiety sensitivity ( AS ) , a well-established risk factor for the development of psychopathology .
METHODS	Participants ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to view medical symptom related websites or general health and wellness control websites .
METHODS	AS was measured before and after the website viewing .
RESULTS	Individuals in the medical website group reported higher AS compared to the control group at post-manipulation after controlling for baseline health anxiety and baseline AS .
RESULTS	Additionally , intolerance of uncertainty ( IU ) , an individual difference variable assessing negative beliefs about uncertainty , significantly moderated this effect such that medical website viewing only affected AS in participants with high IU but not in participants with low IU .
CONCLUSIONS	The limitations of the current study include the lack of individualization of the website viewing and the short duration of the website viewing .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study provide initial evidence that exposure to online medical information could increase risk for anxiety psychopathology in individuals with elevated IU .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , these results provide support for a learning based model of the etiology of AS .

BACKGROUND	Miglitol is an - glucosidase inhibitor ( AGI ) used as an antihyperglycemic agent in the treatment of type @ diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	The mechanism is that miglitol binds to and inhibits the - glucosidase reversibly in the proximal intestine .
BACKGROUND	Thus , carbohydrates not digested in the upper small intestine are transported to the lower intestine where they are eventually digested .
OBJECTIVE	This study was performed for the subsequent marketing of the test miglitol formulation in Korea .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the comparative bioavailability and tolerability of the test and reference formulations in healthy male adult volunteers .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy adult subjects were enrolled in this single-dose , randomized , open-label , @-period , @-sequence , crossover bioequivalence study .
METHODS	During each period , subjects received @ mg of miglitol test or reference .
METHODS	Blood samples from the subjects were obtained before dosing at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ hours after oral drug administration .
METHODS	Plasma concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) .
METHODS	The PK parameters including AUCt , AUC , Cmax , and tmax were measured and all treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) and their relationships to study these medications were recorded throughout the entire study .
RESULTS	A total of @ healthy adult male Korean subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized into two treatment groups .
RESULTS	Ultimately , @ subjects completed the study .
RESULTS	During each treatment period , blood samples were collected at specific time intervals from @ to @ hours after administration of a single drug dose .
RESULTS	The PK parameters including AUCt , AUC , Cmax , and tmax were calculated and the @ % CIs of the ratio ( test/reference ) of the parameters were obtained by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) on logarithmically transformed data .
RESULTS	The @ % CIs of the geometric mean ratios for the test to reference formulations were as follows : @ ( @ - @ ) for AUCt and @ ( @ - @ ) for Cmax .
RESULTS	Statistical analysis confirmed that the @ % CIs for these PK parameters were within the commonly accepted bioequivalence range of @ - @ .
RESULTS	There were no serious or unexpected TEAEs during the study .
CONCLUSIONS	In the healthy adult Korean subjects , the test and reference formulations had similar PK parameters and similar plasma concentration-time profiles .
CONCLUSIONS	The test formulation of miglitol met the Korean regulatory criteria ( AUCt and Cmax ) for assuming bioequivalence and both formulations were generally well-tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	The CRiS identifiers : KCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	To compare clerkship medical students ' confidence in performing a simulated normal vaginal delivery ( NVD ) after participating in a simulation training session using two different models .
METHODS	Medical students were randomized to participate in a simulated NVD session using either an obstetrics mannequin or a birthing pelvis model .
METHODS	Questionnaires were used to assess confidence and evaluate the simulation before and immediately after the session and on the last day of the obstetrics clerkship rotation .
RESULTS	One hundred ten students were randomized .
RESULTS	At the start of the clerkship , both groups had similar obstetrics exposure and confidence levels .
RESULTS	Only @ students ( @ % ) agreed they were ready to attempt a NVD with minimal supervision or independently .
RESULTS	This increased significantly to @ students ( @ % ) immediately after the session .
RESULTS	At the end of the clerkship , @ of @ responding students ( @ % ) were confident that they could attempt a NVD with minimal supervision or independently .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences noted between simulator groups at any point .
RESULTS	The sessions were rated as equally useful and realistic , and this remained unchanged at the end of the clerkship .
CONCLUSIONS	Simulated NVD training using either an obstetrics mannequin or a birthing pelvis model provides clerkship students with a positive experience and increases confidence immediately .
CONCLUSIONS	It should be implemented early in the rotation , as it appears the clerkship experience also plays a large role in terms of students ' confidence .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite this , students maintain this type of learning is useful .
CONCLUSIONS	Effective simulation training can easily be incorporated into clerkship training .

OBJECTIVE	Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) provides benefit for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) in terms of quality of life ( QoL ) and exercise capacity ; however , the effects diminish over time .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate a maintenance programme for patients who had completed PR .
METHODS	Primary and secondary care PR programmes in Norfolk .
METHODS	@ patients with COPD who had completed at least @ % of a standard PR programme were randomised and data are available for @ patients .
METHODS	Patients had greater than @ pack year smoking history and less than @ % predicted forced expiratory volume in @s but no other significant disease or recent respiratory tract infection .
METHODS	Patients were randomised to receive a maintenance programme or standard care .
METHODS	The maintenance programme consisted of @h ( @h individually tailored exercise training and @h education programme ) every @months for @year .
METHODS	The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ ) ( primary outcome ) , endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT ) , EuroQol ( EQ@D ) , hospital anxiety and depression score ( HADS ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat , activity levels ( overall score and activity diary ) and exacerbations were assessed before and after @months .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for the change in CRQ dyspnoea score ( primary end point ) at @months which amounted to @ ( -@ to @ ) units or other domains of the CRQ .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the ESWT duration ( -@ ( -@ to @ ) seconds ) , BMI , body fat , EQ@D , MET-minutes , activity rating , HADS , exacerbations or admissions .
CONCLUSIONS	A maintenance programme of three monthly @h sessions does not improve outcomes in patients with COPD after @months .
CONCLUSIONS	We do not recommend that our maintenance programme is adopted .
CONCLUSIONS	Other methods of sustaining the benefits of PR are required .

BACKGROUND	Only few randomized trials comparing sustained effects of short - and long-term psychotherapies in personality functioning are available .
BACKGROUND	In this study we compared the effects of two short-term therapies and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy on patients ' personality functioning during a @-year follow-up .
METHODS	Altogether @ patients of the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study , with anxiety or mood disorder , were randomly assigned to either short-term psychotherapy of about six months ( solution-focused therapy ( SFT , n = @ ) or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy ( SPP , n = @ ) ) , or to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy ( LPP , n = @ ) , lasting on average three years .
METHODS	Outcomes in personality functioning ( i.e. , self-concept , defense style , interpersonal problems , and level of personality organization ) were assessed five to seven times using , respectively , questionnaires ( SASB , DSQ , IIP ) and interview ( LPO ) during the @-year follow-up from randomization .
RESULTS	Personality functioning improved in all therapy groups .
RESULTS	Both short-term therapies fared better than LPP during the first year of follow-up , by faster improvement in self-concept and decrease in immature defense style .
RESULTS	SFT also showed more early reduction of interpersonal problems .
RESULTS	However , LPP thereafter showed larger and more sustained benefits than SFT and SPP , through greater changes in self-concept .
RESULTS	Additionally , LPP outperformed SFT at the end of the follow-up in IIP and LPO , after adjustment for auxiliary treatment .
RESULTS	No differences were noted between the short-term therapies at any measurement point .
CONCLUSIONS	Auxiliary treatment was used relatively widely which limits generalization to exclusive use of short - or long-term therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	LPP seems to be somewhat more effective than short-term therapies in facilitating longterm changes in personality functioning .

OBJECTIVE	Acute oral tyrosine administration has been associated with increased constant-load , submaximal exercise capacity in the heat .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to determine whether self-paced exercise performance in the heat is enhanced with the same tyrosine dosage .
METHODS	After familiarization , seven male endurance-trained volunteers , unacclimated to exercise in the heat , performed two experimental trials in @C ( @ % relative humidity ) in a crossover fashion separated by at least @ d. Subjects ingested @ mgkg ( -@ ) body mass tyrosine ( TYR ) or an isocaloric quantity of whey powder ( PLA ) in @ mL of sugar-free flavored water in a randomized , double-blind fashion .
METHODS	Sixty minutes after drink ingestion , the subjects cycled for @ min at @ % @ % peak oxygen uptake ( VO@peak ) and then performed a simulated cycling time trial requiring completion of an individualized target work quantity ( @ @ kJ ) .
RESULTS	The ratio of plasma tyrosine plus phenylalanine ( tyrosine precursor ) to amino acids competing for brain uptake ( free-tryptophan , leucine , isoleucine , valine , methionine , threonine , and lysine ) increased @-fold from rest in TYR and remained elevated throughout exercise ( P < @ ) , whereas it declined in PLA from rest to preexercise ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Time-trial power output ( P = @ ) and performance ( @ @ and @ @ min in TYR and PLA , respectively ; P = @ ) were similar between trials .
RESULTS	Thermal sensation ( P > @ ) , RPE ( P > @ ) , core temperature ( P = @ ) , skin temperature ( P = @ ) , and heart rate ( P = @ ) did not differ between trials .
CONCLUSIONS	These data indicate that acute tyrosine administration did not influence self-paced endurance exercise performance in the heat .
CONCLUSIONS	Plasma tyrosine availability is apparently not a key determinant of fatigue processes under these conditions .

BACKGROUND	To improve the translation of public health evidence into practice , there is a need to increase practitioner involvement in initiative development , to place greater emphasis on contextual knowledge , and to address intervention processes and outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Evidence that demonstrates the need to reduce childhood fire-related injuries is compelling but its translation into practice is inconsistent and limited .
BACKGROUND	With this knowledge the Keeping Children Safe programme developed an `` Injury Prevention Briefing ( IPB ) '' using a @ step process to combine scientific evidence with practitioner contextual knowledge .
BACKGROUND	The IPB was designed specifically for children 's centres ( CCs ) to support delivery of key fire safety messages to parents .
BACKGROUND	This paper reports the findings of a nested qualitative study within a clustered randomised controlled trial of the IPB , in which staff described their experiences of IPB implementation to aid understanding of why or how the intervention worked .
METHODS	Interviews were conducted with key staff at @ CCs participating in the two intervention arms : @ ) IPB supplemented by initial training and regular facilitation ; @ ) IPB sent by post with no facilitation .
METHODS	Framework Analysis was applied to these interview data to explore intervention adherence including ; exposure or dose ; quality of delivery ; participant responsiveness ; programme differentiation ; and staff experience of IPB implementation .
METHODS	This included barriers , facilitators and suggested improvements .
RESULTS	@ % of CCs regarded the IPB as a simple , accessible tool which raised awareness , and stimulated discussion and behaviour change .
RESULTS	@ CCs suggested minor modifications to format and content .
RESULTS	Four levels of implementation were identified according to content , frequency , duration and coverage .
RESULTS	Most CCs ( @ % ) achieved ` extended ' or ` essential ' IPB implementation .
RESULTS	Three universal factors affected all CCs : organisational change and resourcing ; working with hard to engage groups ; additional demands of participating in a research study .
RESULTS	Six specific factors were associated with the implementation level achieved : staff engagement and training ; staff continuity ; adaptability and flexibility ; other agency support ; conflicting priorities ; facilitation .
RESULTS	CCs achieving high implementation levels increased from @ % ( no facilitation ) to @ % with facilitation .
CONCLUSIONS	Incorporating service provider perspectives and scientific evidence into health education initiatives enhances potential for successful implementation , particularly when supplemented by ongoing training and facilitation .

METHODS	To determine whether the insulin resistance that exists in metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) patients is modulated by dietary fat composition .
RESULTS	Seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to one of four diets for @ wk : high-saturated fatty acids ( HSFAs ) , high-MUFA ( HMUFA ) , and two low-fat , high-complex carbohydrate ( LFHCC ) diets supplemented with long-chain n-@ ( LFHCC n-@ ) PUFA or placebo .
RESULTS	At the end of intervention , the LFHCC n-@ diet reduced plasma insulin , homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance , and nonsterified fatty acid concentration ( p < @ ) as compared to baseline Spanish habitual ( BSH ) diet .
RESULTS	Subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( WAT ) analysis revealed decreased EH-domain containing-@ mRNA levels and increased cbl-associated protein gene expression with the LFHCC n-@ compared to HSFA and HMUFA diets , respectively ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , the LFHCC n-@ decreased gene expression of glyceraldehyde-@-phosphate dehydrogenase with respect to HMUFA and BSH diets ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Finally , proteomic characterization of subcutaneous WAT identified three proteins of glucose metabolism downregulated by the LFHCC n-@ diet , including annexin A@ .
RESULTS	RT-PCR analysis confirmed the decrease of annexin A@ ( p = @ ) after this diet .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest that the LFHCC n-@ diet reduces systemic insulin resistance and improves insulin signaling in subcutaneous WAT of MetS patients compared to HSFA and BSH diets consumption .

RESULTS	The B-type natriuretic peptide level before hospital arrival was @ pg/mL in @ % .
RESULTS	Troponin was > @ ng/mL in @ % ; @ % had troponin > @ ng/mL .
RESULTS	After adjudication , @ % had acute coronary syndrome , @ % acute heart failure , @ % angina , and @ % another diagnosis .
RESULTS	The primary end point was @ ( interquartile range , @-@ @ ) hours in the biomarker group and @ ( interquartile range , @-@ @ ) hours in the usual care group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	None died in the ambulance or in the emergency department : all-cause @-day mortality was @ % ( usual care ) and @ % ( biomarker ) .
CONCLUSIONS	To our knowledge , this is the first randomized trial of biomarkers before hospital arrival to guide emergency management of suspected acute cardiovascular disease which showed no benefit and was terminated early because of futility .
CONCLUSIONS	The results have important implications for the use of biomarkers in emergency management of heart disease and for the design of future randomized trials on this important topic .

BACKGROUND	Medication-overuse headache ( MOH ) is a common problem in primary care .
BACKGROUND	Brief intervention ( BI ) has successfully been used for detoxification from overuse of alcohol and drugs .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this pilot study was to develop and test methodology , acceptability and logistics for a BI for MOH in primary care .
RESULTS	Observational feasibility study of an intervention in a Norwegian general practice population.Six general practitioners ( GPs ) were recruited .
RESULTS	A screening questionnaire for MOH was sent to all @-@ year old patients on these GPs ` list .
RESULTS	GPs were taught BI , which was applied to MOH patients as follows : Severity of dependence scale ( SDS ) scores were collected and individual feedback was given of the relationship between the SDS , medication overuse and headache .
RESULTS	Finally , advice to reduce medication was given .
RESULTS	Patients were invited to a headache interview three months after the BI .
RESULTS	Main outcomes were feedback from GPs/patients about the feasibility and logistics of the study design , screening/recruitment process , BI and headache interviews .
RESULTS	Efficacy and patient-related outcomes were not focused .
RESULTS	The patients reported a high degree of acceptability of the methodology .
RESULTS	The GPs reported the BI to be feasible to implement within a busy practice and to represent a new and improved instrument for communication with MOH patients .
RESULTS	The BI requires further testing in a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) in order to provide evidence of efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	This feasibility study will be used to improve the BI for MOH and the design of a cluster-RCT .

OBJECTIVE	Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , which may reduce the risk for coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , can be synthesized at low rates from - linolenic acid ( ALA ) .
OBJECTIVE	The rate-limiting step for this conversion is the @-desaturation of ALA into stearidonic acid ( SDA ) .
OBJECTIVE	Thus providing oils rich in SDA may increase endogenous synthesis of EPA , which may subsequently lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations , an effect frequently observed after EPA supplementation .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore studied the effects of Echium oil on serum triacylglycerol concentrations and the omega-@ index , which correlate negatively with the risk for CHD .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted , in which @ healthy overweight and slightly obese subjects daily received @ g of Echium oil ( providing @ g of SDA ) or a high oleic acid sunflower oil ( HOSO ) as control for @ weeks , with a washout period of at least @ days .
METHODS	Four subjects dropped out .
METHODS	Differences between periods were tested for statistical significance ( P < @ ) using a paired t-test .
RESULTS	Serum triacylglycerol and other lipid concentrations were not significantly affected by consumption of Echium oil compared with HOSO .
RESULTS	Echium oil significantly increased percentage of EPA in red blood cell ( RBC ) membranes with @ @ % ( mean s.d. ) compared with HOSO ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant effects on docosahexaenoic acid in RBC membranes or on the omega-@ index were found .
CONCLUSIONS	In healthy overweight and slightly obese subjects , an increased intake of SDA from Echium oil does not lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite an increase in the percentage of EPA in RBC membranes , the omega-@ index was not changed .

OBJECTIVE	Huai Qi Huang ( HQH ) is a compound Chinese herbal medicine that contains Trametes robiniophila murr , wolfberry fruit , and Polygonatum .
OBJECTIVE	In the present study , we investigated the effects of HQH on patients with mild immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN ) through a prospective randomized controlled study .
METHODS	Forty-five adults diagnosed with IgAN according to renal pathology , who had hematuria or/and proteinuria ( @ g/day ) , were randomly assigned to receive HQH or no treatment for @ weeks .
METHODS	Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion and hematuria were measured at Weeks @ , @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	The rate of complete remission of proteinuria and hematuria was evaluated .
METHODS	Any adverse events induced by HQH were also observed during the treatment period .
RESULTS	Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced by HQH treatment compared with that in the control group at Weeks @ and @ .
RESULTS	A much higher rate of complete remission of proteinuria was observed in the HQH group than in control group at Week @ .
RESULTS	HQH administration also obviously reduced the extent of hematuria compared with that in the control group at Week @ .
RESULTS	HQH treatment dramatically increased the rate of complete remission of hematuria compared with that in control group at Weeks @ and @ .
RESULTS	No obvious adverse events caused by HQH were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	HQH could be a new conservative therapy for IgAN patients who can not tolerate steroids and immunosuppressive agents .
CONCLUSIONS	The relapse rate after discontinuing treatment still needs further investigation .

BACKGROUND	Extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection is an important cause of stroke , especially in young people .
BACKGROUND	In some observational studies it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke .
BACKGROUND	Both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs are used to reduce risk of stroke but whether one treatment strategy is more effective than the other is unknown .
BACKGROUND	We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study ( CADISS ) , with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke .
METHODS	We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services ( @ in the UK and seven in Australia ) .
METHODS	We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past @ days .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs ( specific treatment decided by the local clinician ) for @ months .
METHODS	Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation , but investigators assessing endpoints were .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	The trial was registered with EUDract ( @-@-@ ) and ISRN ( CTN@ ) .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ participants ( @ carotid , @ vertebral ) .
RESULTS	Mean time to randomisation was @ days ( SD @ ) .
RESULTS	The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack ( n = @ ) and local symptoms ( headache , neck pain , or Horner 's syndrome ; n = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus @ to anticoagulant treatment .
RESULTS	Overall , four ( @ % ) of @ patients had stroke recurrence ( all ipsilateral ) .
RESULTS	Stroke or death occurred in three ( @ % ) of @ patients versus one ( @ % ) of @ ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no deaths , but one major bleeding ( subarachnoid haemorrhage ) in the anticoagulant group .
RESULTS	Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in @ patients .
RESULTS	Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three ( @ % ) of @ patients in the antiplatelet group versus one ( @ % ) of @ patients in the anticoagulant group ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups , and much rarer than reported in some observational studies .
CONCLUSIONS	Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases , suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of eyelid cooling to reduce postoperative pain , edema , erythema , and hematoma after upper blepharoplasty .
METHODS	After bilateral upper blepharoplasty in @ consecutive patients , one eyelid per patient was randomized for cooling with an ice pack , and the other eyelid was left uncooled .
METHODS	Pain was scored by the patients using a visual analogue scale ( @ to @ ) @ hour and @ day after surgery .
METHODS	Degree of edema , erythema , and hematoma were scored by the patients on a four-point rating scale ( no , minimal , moderate , or severe ) @ hour , @ day , @ week , and @ months after surgery .
METHODS	Light photography was obtained @ week after surgery for scoring the degree of bruising on a four-point rating scale by a blinded observer .
RESULTS	Pain did not differ between cooled and uncooled eyelids on the day of surgery .
RESULTS	However , pain in cooled eyelids was significantly lower @ day after surgery ( p = @ ) , yet absolute pain scores were low ( median , @ and @ , on a scale of @ ) .
RESULTS	Edema , erythema , or hematoma did not differ between cooled and uncooled eyelids on any of the time points studied .
CONCLUSIONS	Cooling of eyelids after upper blepharoplasty does not reduce edema , erythema , or hematoma of the eyelids , but reduces pain @ day after surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	However , because the degree of pain seems clinically irrelevant and because the majority of patients indicate that they have no preference for cooling over noncooling , eyelid cooling after upper blepharoplasty as a rule of thumb can be abandoned .
METHODS	Therapeutic , II .

BACKGROUND	There is limited evidence to support the use of facemasks in preventing infection for primary care professionals .
BACKGROUND	Negative effects on communication has been suggested when the physician wears a facemask .
BACKGROUND	As communication skills and doctor patient relationship are essential to primary care consultations , the effects of doctor 's facemask wearing were explored .
METHODS	A randomised controlled study was conducted in primary care to explore the effects of doctors wearing facemasks on patients ' perception of doctors ' empathy , patient enablement and patient satisfaction .
METHODS	Primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong .
METHODS	Patients ' views were gathered using the Consultation and Relational Empathy ( CARE ) Measure , Patient Enablement Instrument ( PEI ) and an overall satisfaction rating scale .
METHODS	The effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel ( hierarchical ) modelling .
RESULTS	@,@ patients were randomised to doctor-mask wearing consultations ( n = @ ) and non mask wearing consultations ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	A significant and negative effect was found in the patients ' perception of the doctors ' empathy ( CARE score reduction -@ , p-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the more established doctor-patient relationship , the effect of doctors ' mask wearing was more pronounced ( CARE score reduction -@ , p-value = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations , this has a significant negative impact on the patient 's perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity .
CONCLUSIONS	Consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national , local or practice level .

BACKGROUND	Limited ankle joint dorsiflexion passive range of motion ( PROM ) has been associated with common chronic lower extremity conditions , and clinicians often instruct patients in stretching exercises to increase dorsiflexion .
BACKGROUND	However , little is known about how subtalar joint ( STJ ) position affects dorsiflexion at the midfoot/forefoot versus ankle/rearfoot during gastrocnemius stretching .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine if more dorsiflexion occurs at the ankle/rearfoot and less at the midfoot/forefoot during gastrocnemius stretching with the STJ positioned in supination versus pronation .
METHODS	In this repeated measures design , @ participants ( @ females , @ males ; mean age = @ years , SD = @ ) with current or recent history of lower extremity chronic conditions and less than @ degrees ankle dorsiflexion measured with the knee in extension on the involved side ( s ) performed five @-second gastrocnemius stretching trials in pronation and supination on each side in a randomly determined sequence .
METHODS	A @-camera Vicon Motion Analysis System and an AMTI force plate were used to measure midfoot/forefoot dorsiflexion , ankle/rearfoot dorsiflexion , knee extension , and normalized vertical ground reaction force .
RESULTS	Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant increase in midfoot/forefoot dorsiflexion when stretching in pronation compared to supination ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	ANOVAs also demonstrated significantly more extension of the knee when stretching in supination compared to pronation ( P < @ ) , and increased normalized vertical ground reaction force when stretching in supination compared to pronation ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	With the numbers available , no significant difference in ankle/rearfoot dorsiflexion when stretching in supination compared to pronation could be detected ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Gastrocnemius stretching in pronation resulted in more dorsiflexion at the midfoot/forefoot than stretching in supination .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinicians may want to consider STJ position during gastrocnemius stretching to either facilitate or limit recruitment of dorsiflexion motion at the midfoot/forefoot .

BACKGROUND	Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa .
BACKGROUND	Raised intracranial pressure ( ICP ) is common in cryptococcosis .
BACKGROUND	Prior studies suggest elevated ICP is associated with mortality , and guidelines recommend frequent lumbar punctures ( LPs ) to control ICP .
BACKGROUND	However , the magnitude of the impact of LPs on cryptococcal-related mortality is unknown .
METHODS	In sum , @ individuals with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - associated cryptococcal meningitis , screened for the Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing ( COAT ) trial in Uganda and South Africa , were observed .
METHODS	Individuals received an LP to diagnose meningitis , and subsequent therapeutic LPs were recommended for elevated ICP ( > @ mmH@O ) or new symptoms .
METHODS	We compared survival , through @ days , between individuals receiving at least @ therapeutic LP with individuals not receiving therapeutic LPs .
METHODS	The COAT trial randomized subjects at @-@ days ; thus , follow-up stopped at time of death , randomization , or @ days .
RESULTS	Seventy-five ( @ % ) individuals had at least @ therapeutic LP .
RESULTS	Individuals receiving therapeutic LPs had higher cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) opening pressures , higher CSF fungal burdens , and were more likely to have altered mental status at baseline than those with no therapeutic LPs .
RESULTS	Thirty-one deaths ( @ % ) occurred among @ individuals without a therapeutic LP and @ deaths ( @ % ) among @ with at least @ therapeutic LP .
RESULTS	The adjusted relative risk of mortality was @ ( @ % confidence interval : @ -@ ) .
RESULTS	The association was observed regardless of opening pressure at baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Therapeutic LPs were associated with a @ % relative improvement in survival , regardless of initial intracranial pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	The role of therapeutic LPs should be reevaluated .

BACKGROUND	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) are currently used to control proteinuria in dogs with chronic kidney disease .
BACKGROUND	Renal diets ( RDs ) have beneficial effects in the management of azotemic dogs , but its role in proteinuric non-azotemic ( PNAz ) dogs has been poorly documented .
OBJECTIVE	Administration of a RD to PNAz dogs treated with benazepril ( Be ) improves proteinuria control compared with the administration of a maintenance diet ( MD ) .
METHODS	Twenty-two PNAz ( urine protein/creatinine ratio -LSB- UPC -RSB- > @ ) dogs .
METHODS	Randomized open label clinical trial design .
METHODS	Dogs were assigned to group-MD ( @ g protein/@ kcal ME ) / Be or to group-RD ( @ g protein/@ kcal ME ) / Be group during @ days .
METHODS	Dogs with serum albumin ( Alb ) < @ g/dL received aspirin ( @ mg/kg/@ hours ) .
METHODS	A physical examination , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) measurement , complete blood count ( CBC ) , biochemistry panel , urinalysis , and UPC were performed at day @ ( D@ ) and day @ ( D@ ) .
RESULTS	At D@ , there were no significant differences between groups in the evaluated variables .
RESULTS	During the study , logUPC ( geometric mean ( @ % CI ) and SBP ( meanSD mmHg ) significantly decreased ( paired t-test , P = @ ) in Group-RD ( logUPC ( D@ ) = @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ; UPC ( D@ ) = @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ; SBP ( D@ ) = @ @ ; SBP ( D@ ) = @ @ ) , but not in Group-MD ( UPC ( D@ ) = @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ; UPC ( D@ ) = @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ; SBP ( D@ ) = @ @ ; SBP ( D@ ) = @ @ ) .
RESULTS	However , RM-ANOVA test did not confirm that changes were consequence of dietary modification .
RESULTS	Weight and Alb concentration did not change significantly in any group .
CONCLUSIONS	The administration of a RD to PNAz dogs treated with Be might help to control proteinuria and SBP compared with the administration of a MD , without inducing clinically detectable malnutrition , but more studies are warranted .

BACKGROUND	To assess the temporal patterns of late gastrointestinal ( GI ) and genitourinary ( GU ) radiotherapy toxicity and resolution rates in a randomised controlled trial ( All-Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group @-@ ) assessing duration of neo-adjuvant ( NA ) hormone therapy for localised prostate cancer .
METHODS	Node negative patients with > @ of : PSA > @ ng/mL , Gleason score @ , and stage T@ or more , were included .
METHODS	Follow-up , including toxicity assessment , was three-monthly in the early stages and yearly thereafter .
RESULTS	Median follow-up from the end of RT was @ years .
RESULTS	In the interval between @ days following the end of RT and the last toxicity assessment , GI and GU toxicity ( any grade ) was found in @ % and @ % of @ and @ patients , respectively .
RESULTS	For those who did develop toxicity , the median time from end of RT until the first development of any grade GI or GU toxicity was @ years and @ years , respectively , whilst median time to final resolution was @ years and @ years , respectively .
RESULTS	Grade @ ( G@ ) or greater GI and GU toxicity occurred in @ ( @ % ) and @ ( @ % ) patients , respectively .
RESULTS	The proportion with unresolved G@ + GI and GU toxicity was @ % and @ % , respectively , in year @ , @ % and @ % in year @ , @ % and @ % in year @ and @ % and @ % in year @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term toxicities continue to occur many years after NA hormone therapy and RT. .
CONCLUSIONS	The rate of occurrence does not appear to reduce within the time frame during which our patients were followed .
CONCLUSIONS	The percentage of patients suffering from G@ + toxicity at any time is however low .
CONCLUSIONS	Resolution of these toxicities continues for the duration of the follow-up .

BACKGROUND	A novel therapeutic management of osteoarthritis ( OA ) of the knee was assessed .
BACKGROUND	The study aimed to evaluate the effect of monthly sodium bicarbonate with a single ( SBCG@ ) or double dose ( SBCG@ ) of calcium gluconate injections on OA of the knee ; as well as the efficacy and safety of both SBCG interventions in the long term .
METHODS	A double-blind parallel-group clinical trial with @ knee OA patients was performed during @months , both SBCG interventions were followed-up for another @mo after intervention .
METHODS	The outcome variables were the Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) , the Lequesne 's functional index and joint-space width changes from serial radiographs .
RESULTS	After @months , group SBCG@ decreased -@ ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ) and group SBCG@ decreased -@ ( -@ , -@ ) in the global WOMAC score , the mean changes represent @ % and @ % lessened pain , respectively .
RESULTS	In the Lequesne Functional Index scale , SBCG@ decreased -@ ( -@ , -@ ) and SBCG@ decreased -@ ( -@ , -@ ) , representing @ and @ % of improvement .
RESULTS	Both mean scores were maintained after intervention discontinued .
RESULTS	SBCG@ improved the knees ' joint space width more than SBCG@ at @ and @months .
RESULTS	Both SBCG interventions were well tolerated after @months of treatment
CONCLUSIONS	A solution of sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate is effective on reducing the symptoms associated with OA .
CONCLUSIONS	Its beneficial effect is maintained for one year of continuous monthly administration and at least for @months after the administration is discontinued .
CONCLUSIONS	When the dose of calcium gluconate is increased , it prevents further narrowing of joint-space .

OBJECTIVE	Concern about pain during placement of an intrauterine device ( IUD ) represents a barrier to use , especially among nulliparous women .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that nitroglycerin gel applied vaginally @ min prior to IUD placement would reduce insertion-related pain .
METHODS	We designed a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of @-mg nitroglycerin gel ( @ mL ) or identical placebo gel applied vaginally in nulliparous women @ min prior to IUD placement .
METHODS	The study was limited to women who opted for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system .
METHODS	Subjects completed a series of @-mm visual analogue scales at several time points .
METHODS	The primary outcome was subject-reported pain with passage of the IUD through the cervix .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included subject-reported pain at other time points , provider-reported ease of insertion , side effects , adverse events and need for additional dilation .
RESULTS	A total of @ women were randomized .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar between groups .
RESULTS	The mean pain score with IUD deployment was @ mm -LSB- standard deviation ( SD ) = @ mm -RSB- in the placebo group and @ mm ( SD @ mm ) in the nitroglycerin group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in ease of insertion reported by providers .
RESULTS	Two subjects required dilation , one in each group .
CONCLUSIONS	Vaginal administration of @-mg nitroglycerin gel @ min prior to IUD placement does not appear to decrease patient-reported procedural pain among nulliparous women or ease of insertion for providers .

BACKGROUND	Long-term clinical outcomes of everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) compared with sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) have not been evaluated fully yet , especially whether EES implantation could positively affect late adverse events reported after SES implantation occurring > @ year .
RESULTS	In this all-comer prospective multicenter randomized open-label trial , @ patients were assigned randomly to implant either EES ( n = @ ) or SES ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ years , EES was noninferior to SES on the primary safety end point ( all-cause death or myocardial infarction ; @ % versus @ % ; noninferiority P < @ ; and superiority P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Cumulative incidence of definite stent thrombosis was low and was not significantly different between the @ groups ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the efficacy end point of target-lesion revascularization between the EES and SES groups ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the cumulative incidence of target-lesion failure ( cardiac death/target-vessel myocardial infarction/ischemia-driven target-lesion revascularization ) was significantly lower in the EES group than in the SES group ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	By a landmark analysis at @ year , the cumulative incidence of very late stent thrombosis and late target-lesion revascularization was not significantly different between the @ groups ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ and @ % versus @ % ; P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy and safety outcomes for this trial after EES implantation remained comparable with those after SES implantation through @-year follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	However , improvement of clinical outcome after EES implantation compared with SES implantation was suggested by the significantly lower cumulative incidences of target-lesion failure , which has been the most widely used primary end point in the stent-versus-stent trials .

BACKGROUND	Metamizole use has been limited because of its risk of agranulocytosis .
BACKGROUND	However , more recent literature seems to support its safety .
BACKGROUND	This prospective , randomised , double-blind study was conducted to compare the analgesic effects of intravenous metamizole or intravenous paracetamol in combination with morphine PCA during the first @h following total hip arthroplasty .
METHODS	One hundred ten consecutive patients were selected for study .
METHODS	The two study groups were ( A ) metamizole , ( B ) paracetamol .
METHODS	Postoperative pain therapy was provided by Morphine PCA pump .
METHODS	In the first treatment group ( A group ) , all patients received intravenous metamizole @ g every @h during the first @ postoperative hours .
METHODS	In the second treatment group ( B group ) , all patients received intravenous paracetamol @g every @h during the first @ postoperative hours .
METHODS	Postoperative pain intensity was measured @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @h after the end of surgery by a VAS .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences in VAS pain values favoring metamizole were reported at @-h ( p = @ ) , @-h ( p = @ ) , @-h ( p = @ ) , @-h ( p < @ ) and @-h ( p = @ ) post-baseline .
RESULTS	Mean cumulative pain values were @ for metamizole and @ for paracetamol .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , we have also shown excellent efficacy of paracetamol and metamizole combined with opioids , but metamizole proved to be a better analgesic than paracetamol .
CONCLUSIONS	It is also necessary to mention the financial aspect considering that intravenous paracetamol is about ten times more expensive than an equivalent analgesic doses of intravenous metamizole .

METHODS	Bone healing was compared in smokers versus nonsmokers who underwent open wedge HTOs with intact lateral hinges .
METHODS	Fractured lateral hinges were classified according to the Takeuchi classification and separately analyzed regarding bone healing .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo early ( @ days ) or standard ( @ weeks ) full-weight-bearing rehabilitation .
RESULTS	A delay in the osteotomy gap filling rate between smokers and nonsmokers could be observed at all follow-up periods , but differences were not significant .
RESULTS	A fracture of the lateral hinge was found in @ % of the patients .
RESULTS	A type I fracture was observed in @ % of patients , a type II fracture was observed in @ % , and a type III fracture was found in @ % .
RESULTS	The highest increase in the osteotomy gap filling rate was observed between @ weeks and @ months after surgery in patients with intact lateral hinges .
RESULTS	For patients with unstable type II fractures , the highest increase in the gap filling rate was delayed until @ to @ months .
RESULTS	Early full weight bearing had no effect on the gap filling rate in any of the patient groups evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that osteotomy gap filling after open wedge HTO is delayed in smokers and in patients in whom opening of the gap resulted in unstable lateral hinge fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	Early full weight bearing did not have a significant effect on the gap filling rate .
METHODS	Level III , prognostic study .

BACKGROUND	Knowing family history is important for understanding cancer risk , yet communication within families is suboptimal .
BACKGROUND	Providing strategies to enhance communication may be useful .
METHODS	Four hundred ninety women were recruited from urban , safety-net , hospital-based primary care women 's health clinics .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to receive the KinFact intervention or the control handout on lowering risks for breast/colon cancer and screening recommendations .
METHODS	Cancer family history was reviewed with all participants .
METHODS	The @-minute KinFact intervention , based in communication and behavior theory , included reviewing individualized breast/colon cancer risks and an interactive presentation about cancer and communication .
METHODS	Study outcomes included whether participants reported collecting family history , shared cancer risk information with relatives , and the frequency of communication with relatives .
METHODS	Data were collected at baseline , @ , @ , and @ months .
RESULTS	Overall , intervention participants were significantly more likely to gather family cancer information at follow-up ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ , @ ) and to share familial cancer information with relatives ( OR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Communication frequency ( @ = not at all ; @ = a lot ) was significantly increased at follow-up ( @ vs. @ ) .
RESULTS	Differences were not modified by age , race , education , or family history .
RESULTS	However , effects were modified by pregnancy status and genetic literacy .
RESULTS	Intervention effects for information gathering and frequency were observed for nonpregnant women but not for pregnant women .
RESULTS	Additionally , intervention effects were observed for information gathering in women with high genetic literacy , but not in women with low genetic literacy .
CONCLUSIONS	The KinFact intervention successfully promoted family communication about cancer risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Educating women to enhance their communication skills surrounding family history may allow them to partner more effectively with their families and ultimately their providers in discussing risks and prevention .

BACKGROUND	The use of drug-eluting stents ( DES ) in patients at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis has not been prospectively studied ; limited data are available in patients who have a low restenosis risk .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to compare a hydrophilic polymer-based , second-generation zotarolimus-eluting stent ( ZES ) with a unique drug fast-release profile versus bare-metal stents ( BMS ) under similar durations of dual-antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @,@ patients with stable or unstable symptoms , and who on the basis of thrombotic bleeding or restenosis risk criteria , qualified as uncertain candidates for DES , to receive ZES or BMS .
METHODS	DAPT duration was on the basis of patient characteristics , rather than stent characteristics , and allowed for a personalized @-month dual antiplatelet regimen .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the risk of @-year major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , which included death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , or target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) .
RESULTS	Median DAPT duration was @ days ( interquartile range -LSB- IQR -RSB- : @ to @ days ) and did not differ between the groups .
RESULTS	In the ZES group , @ patients ( @ % ) reached the primary endpoint , compared with @ patients ( @ % ) in the BMS group ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p = @ ) as a result of lower MI ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) and TVR rates ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) in the ZES group .
RESULTS	Definite or probable stent thrombosis was also significantly reduced in ZES recipients ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with BMS , DES implantation using a stent with a biocompatible polymer and fast drug-eluting characteristics , combined with an abbreviated , tailored DAPT regimen , resulted in a lower risk of @-year MACE in uncertain candidates for DES implantation .
CONCLUSIONS	( Zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates -LSB- ZEUS -RSB- Study ; NCT@ ) .

METHODS	Prospective randomized allocation of CI patients to receive either a standard ( @ mm ) - or medium ( @ mm ) - length electrode array .
METHODS	The processing strategy and electrode insertion number were held constant .
METHODS	The postoperative testing audiologist was blinded to the map details and array .
METHODS	Tertiary referral center .
METHODS	Thirteen adult CI candidates randomized to receive the standard - ( n = @ ) or medium-length ( n = @ ) electrode array .
METHODS	Unilateral CI using standard - or medium-length array from the same implant system .
METHODS	Speech perception was assessed with HINT sentences in quiet and steady-state noise ( SNR , +@ ) and CNC words in quiet at defined intervals .
METHODS	Quality of life was assessed using the Hearing Device Satisfaction Survey and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit ( APHAB ) .
METHODS	Music perception was assessed using the Musical Sounds In Cochlear implants ( MuSIC ) test .
METHODS	Postoperative electrode insertion angle was assessed using reconstructed computed tomographic images .
RESULTS	Interim analysis necessitated discontinuation of subject enrollment by the institutional review board .
RESULTS	There was a trend ( p = @ ) for improved speech perception performance among standard array patients .
RESULTS	This difference was significant when the standard array group was increased retrospectively .
RESULTS	Quality of life and music perception differences were not apparent between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer electrode insertions ( and greater insertion angles ) appear to offer better speech perception performance in the early postactivation period when using the same implant system .

OBJECTIVE	Numerous uremic solutes are derived from the action of colon microbes .
OBJECTIVE	Two such solutes , indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate , have been associated with adverse outcomes in renal failure .
OBJECTIVE	This study tested whether increasing dietary fiber in the form of resistant starch would lower the plasma levels of these solutes in patients on hemodialysis .
METHODS	Fifty-six patients on maintenance hemodialysis were randomly assigned to receive supplements containing resistant starch ( n = @ ) or control starch ( n = @ ) daily for @ weeks in a study conducted between October @ and May @ .
METHODS	Of these , @ patients ( @ in each group ) completed the study and were included in the final analysis .
METHODS	Plasma indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate levels were measured at baseline and week @ .
RESULTS	Increasing dietary fiber for @ weeks significantly reduced the unbound , free plasma level of indoxyl sulfate ( median -@ % -LSB- @th percentile , @th percentile , -@ , -@ -RSB- for fiber versus -@ % -LSB- -@ , @ -RSB- for control , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The reduction in free plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate was accompanied by a reduction in free plasma levels of p-cresol sulfate ( r = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the reduction of p-cresol sulfate levels was of lesser magnitude and did not achieve significance ( median -@ % -LSB- -@ , @ -RSB- for fiber versus @ % -LSB- -@ , @ -RSB- for control , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Increasing dietary fiber in hemodialysis patients may reduce the plasma levels of the colon-derived solutes indoxyl sulfate and possibly p-cresol sulfate without the need to intensify dialysis treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are required to determine whether such reduction provides clinical benefits .

BACKGROUND	Falls are a major public health concern with at least one third of people aged @ years and over falling at least once per year , and half of these will fall repeatedly , which can lead to injury , pain , loss of function and independence , reduced quality of life and even death .
BACKGROUND	Although the causes of falls are varied and complex , the age-related loss in muscle power has emerged as a useful predictor of disability and falls in older people .
BACKGROUND	In this population , the requirements to produce explosive and rapid movements often occurs whilst simultaneously performing other attention-demanding cognitive or motor tasks , such as walking while talking or carrying an object .
BACKGROUND	The primary aim of this study is to determine whether dual-task functional power training ( DT-FPT ) can reduce the rate of falls in community-dwelling older people .
METHODS	The study design is an @-month cluster randomised controlled trial in which @ adults aged @ years residing in retirement villages , who are at increased risk of falling , will be randomly allocated to : @ ) an exercise programme involving DT-FPT , or @ ) a usual care control group .
METHODS	The intervention is divided into @ distinct phases : @ months of supervised DT-FPT , a @-month ` step down ' maintenance programme , and a @-month follow-up .
METHODS	The primary outcome will be the number of falls after @ , @ and @ months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will include : lower extremity muscle power and strength , grip strength , functional assessments of gait , reaction time and dynamic balance under single - and dual-task conditions , activities of daily living , quality of life , cognitive function and falls-related self-efficacy .
METHODS	We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the programme for preventing falls .
CONCLUSIONS	The study offers a novel approach that may guide the development and implementation of future community-based falls prevention programmes that specifically focus on optimising muscle power and dual-task performance to reduce falls risk under ` real life ' conditions in older adults .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the ` step down ' programme will provide new information about the efficacy of a less intensive maintenance programme for reducing the risk of falls over an extended period .

BACKGROUND	Models of addictive behaviors postulate that implicit alcohol-related memory associations and biased interpretation processes contribute to the development and maintenance of alcohol misuse and abuse .
BACKGROUND	The present study examined whether alcohol-dependent patients ( AP ) show an alcohol-related interpretation bias .
BACKGROUND	Second , the relationship between the interpretation bias and levels of harmful drinking was investigated .
METHODS	The sample included @ clinically diagnosed AP and @ clinically diagnosed control patients ( CP ) who had either a mood or an anxiety disorder .
METHODS	Participants completed a booklet containing @ open-ended ambiguous scenarios .
METHODS	Seven scenarios were alcohol-relevant , and @ were emotionally relevant , that is , panic - or depression-relevant .
METHODS	Participants were asked to read each scenario and to generate a continuation .
METHODS	In addition , the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test ( AUDIT ) and Beck Depression Inventory were administered .
RESULTS	Logistic multivariate multilevel analyses revealed that AP ' probability of generating an alcohol-related continuation on all @ scenario types was higher than that of CP .
RESULTS	Moreover , alcohol-related interpretation biases were positively associated with levels of harmful drinking ( i.e. , AUDIT scores ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings are the first to show that AP show an alcohol-related interpretation bias , which generalizes to other ambiguous emotionally relevant contexts , and therefore advance our understanding of the role of implicit biased alcohol-related memory associations and interpretation processes .

BACKGROUND	Previous research has indicated positive effects of early developmental intervention ( EDI ) on the development of children in developing countries .
BACKGROUND	Few studies , however , have examined longitudinally when differential treatment effects may be observed and whether differential outcomes are associated with exposure to different risk factors and country of implementation .
BACKGROUND	Also , birth asphyxia as a risk condition has not been well studied .
BACKGROUND	To address these limitations , we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that there will be differential developmental trajectories favoring those who receive EDI versus a health education intervention in children in rural areas of India , Pakistan , and Zambia .
METHODS	Children with and without birth asphyxia were randomized to EDI or control intervention , which was implemented by parents who received training in biweekly home visits initiated before child age @ month and continuing until @ months .
METHODS	Development was assessed in @ children at ages @ , @ , and @ months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Ages & Stages Questionnaire administered by evaluators blind to intervention assignment and risk condition .
RESULTS	Longitudinal mixed model analysis indicated that EDI resulted in better development over @ months in cognitive abilities , regardless of risk condition , maternal resources , child gender , or country .
RESULTS	Psychomotor development and parent-reported general development showed similar trends as for cognitive abilities , but were not statistically different between intervention conditions .
RESULTS	Developmental differences were observed first at @ months of age .
CONCLUSIONS	Early developmental intervention has promise for improving development in children across developing countries when exposed to various risk conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	EDI should be one prominent approach used to begin to address long-term outcomes and intergenerational transmission of poverty .

BACKGROUND	Low-dose ketamine infusion ( blood concentration around @ ng/mL ) during surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative shivering after remifentanil-based anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that perioperative infusion of very low-dose ketamine ( blood concentration around @ ng/mL ) during remifentanil-based anesthesia may also prevent the development of remifentanil-induced shivering during the @-hour period after the end of anesthesia .
METHODS	Fifty female patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cystectomy or oophorectomy were assigned to one of two groups : ( @ ) ketamine group , in which the patients received ketamine infusion ( @ mg/kg/hour ) from induction of anesthesia to emergence from anesthesia ; and ( @ ) control group , in which the patients received saline infusion from induction up till emergence from anesthesia .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced and maintained by target-controlled infusion of propofol ( estimated blood concentration : @-@ g/mL ) and infusion of remifentanil , at @-@ @ g/kg/minute .
METHODS	Patients were observed for shivering from the end of anesthesia to @ minutes after anesthesia .
METHODS	The time point at which the patient began to shiver was recorded and assigned to one of four time periods : at emergence , from emergence to @ minutes after anesthesia , from @ minutes to @ minutes after anesthesia , and > @ minutes after anesthesia .
RESULTS	During the @-minute observation period , the number of patients who shivered was higher in the ketamine group than the in control group ( @ vs. @ , ketamine group vs. control group , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The time period during which patients began to shiver was different between the two groups ( @ patient , @ patients , and @ patients vs. @ patients , @ patients , and @ patients at emergence , from emergence to @ minutes , and from @ minutes to @ minutes after anesthesia , respectively ; ketamine group vs. control group , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intraoperative infusion of very low-dose ketamine during remifentanil-based anesthesia may increase the incidence of postoperative shivering .

OBJECTIVE	We assessed whether a brief alcohol intervention would lead to reduced alcohol use and sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) / HIV incidence and related sexual risk behaviors among moderate drinking female sex workers .
METHODS	A randomized controlled intervention trial was conducted with @ female sex workers affiliated with the AIDS , Population , Health , and Integrated Assistance II project in Mombasa , Kenya .
METHODS	Eligible women were hazardous or harmful drinkers who scored between @ and @ ( full range , @-@ ) on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test .
METHODS	Intervention participants received @ counseling sessions approximately monthly .
METHODS	The equal-attention control group received @ nutrition sessions .
METHODS	Participants were followed for @ and @ months after the intervention , with at least @ % retention at both time points .
METHODS	We used general linear models in intention-to-treat analyses , adjusting for recruitment setting and HIV status at enrollment .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant reduction in alcohol use and binge drinking at @ and @ months , with intervention participants reporting less than one third of the odds of higher levels of drinking than the control group .
RESULTS	The intervention did not impact laboratory-confirmed STI/HIV incidence , self-reported condom use , or sexual violence from nonpaying partners .
RESULTS	However , the odds of reporting sexual violence from clients was significantly lower among intervention than control participants at both @ and @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that a brief alcohol intervention can reduce self-reported alcohol consumption among a nondependent and non-treatment-seeking population most at risk for HIV .
CONCLUSIONS	More attention is needed to understand the pathway from drinking to sexual behavior and STI/HIV acquisition .

BACKGROUND	WHO recommends referral to hospital for possible serious bacterial infection in young infants aged @-@ days .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether oral amoxicillin treatment for fast breathing , in the absence of other signs , is as efficacious as the combination of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin .
METHODS	In a randomised , open-label , equivalence trial at five sites in DR Congo , Kenya , and Nigeria , community health workers followed up all births in the community , identified unwell young infants , and referred them to study nurses .
METHODS	We randomly assigned infants with fast breathing as a single sign of illness or possible serious bacterial infection , whose parents did not accept referral to hospital , to receive either injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin once per day or oral amoxicillin treatment twice per day for @ days .
METHODS	A person who was off-site generated randomisation lists using computer software .
METHODS	Trained health professionals gave injections , but outcome assessors were masked to group allocations .
METHODS	The primary outcome was treatment failure by day @ after enrolment , defined as clinical deterioration , development of a serious adverse event including death , persistence of fast breathing on day @ , or recurrence up to day @ .
METHODS	The primary analysis was per protocol and we used a prespecified similarity margin of @ % to assess equivalence between regimens .
METHODS	This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN@ .
RESULTS	From April @ , @ , to March @ , @ , we enrolled @ infants aged @-@ days with fast breathing as the only sign of possible serious bacterial infection at the five study sites .
RESULTS	We assigned @ infants to receive injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin and @ infants to receive oral amoxicillin .
RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis , from which @ infants were excluded , we included @ ( @ % ) infants who fulfilled predefined criteria of adherence to treatment and adequate follow-up in the injectable procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin group and @ ( @ % ) infants in the oral amoxicillin group .
RESULTS	In the procaine benzylpenicillin-gentamicin group , @ infants ( @ % ) failed treatment , compared with @ ( @ % ) infants in the oral amoxicillin group ( risk difference -@ % , @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Four infants died within @ days of follow-up in each group .
RESULTS	We detected no drug-related serious adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Young infants with fast breathing alone can be effectively treated with oral amoxicillin on an outpatient basis when referral to a hospital is not possible .

BACKGROUND	The Respiratory Infections in Andean Peruvian Children ( RESPIRA-PERU ) study enrolled children who participated in a community-cluster randomized trial of improved stoves , solar water disinfection , and kitchen sinks ( IHIP trial ) and children from additional Andean households .
BACKGROUND	We quantified the burden of influenza-associated acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) in this household-based cohort .
METHODS	From May @ to September @ , we conducted active weekly ARI surveillance in @ children age < @ years , of whom @ ( @ % ) had participated in the IHIP trial .
METHODS	We collected nasal swabs during ARI , tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by RT-PCR , and determined influenza incidence and risk factors using mixed-effects regression models .
RESULTS	The overall incidence of influenza-associated ARI was @ / @ child-years ; incidence of influenza A , B , and C was @ , @ , and @ / @ child-years , respectively .
RESULTS	Influenza C was associated with fewer days of subjective fever ( median @ vs. @ ) and malaise ( median @ vs. @ ) compared to influenza A. Non-influenza ARI also resulted in fewer days of fever and malaise , and fewer healthcare visits than influenza A-associated ARI .
RESULTS	Influenza incidence varied by calendar year ( @ % occurred in the @ season ) and IHIP trial participation .
RESULTS	Among households that participated in the IHIP trial , influenza-associated ARI incidence was significantly lower in intervention than in control households ( RR @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Influenza burden is high among Andean children .
CONCLUSIONS	ARI associated with influenza A and B had longer symptom duration and higher healthcare utilization than influenza C-associated ARI or non-influenza ARI .

BACKGROUND	Traffic-related air pollution may contribute to cardiovascular morbidity .
BACKGROUND	In urban areas , exposures during physical activity are of interest owing to increased breathing rates and close proximity to vehicle emissions .
METHODS	We conducted a cross-over study among @ healthy non-smoking women in Montreal , Canada during the summer of @ .
METHODS	Women were exposed to traffic pollutants for @-hours on three separate occasions during cycling on high and low-traffic routes as well as indoors .
METHODS	Personal air pollution exposures ( PM ( @ ) , ultrafine particles ( UFP ) , black carbon , NO , and O ) were evaluated along each route and linear mixed-effects models with random subject intercepts were used to estimate the impact of air pollutants on acute changes in blood pressure , heart rate variability , and micro-vascular function in the hours immediately following exposure .
METHODS	Single and multi-pollutant models were examined and potential effect modification by mean regional air pollution concentrations ( PM ( @ ) , NO , and O ) was explored for the @-hour and @-day periods preceding exposure .
RESULTS	In total , @ exposure routes were completed .
RESULTS	Each interquartile increase ( @,@ / cm ) in UFP exposure was associated with a @ % ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ) decrease in reactive hyperemia index ( a measure of micro-vascular function ) and each @ ppb increase in O exposure corresponded to a @ % ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) increase in systolic blood pressure and a @ % ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) increase in diastolic blood pressure @-hours after exposure .
RESULTS	Personal exposure to PM ( @ ) was associated with decreases in HRV measures reflecting parasympathetic modulation of the heart and regional PM ( @ ) concentrations modified these relationships ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In particular , stronger inverse associations were observed when regional PM ( @ ) was higher on the days prior to the study period .
RESULTS	Regional PM ( @ ) also modified the impact of personal O on the standard deviation of normal to normal intervals ( SDNN ) ( p < @ ) : a significant inverse relationship was observed when regional PM ( @ ) was low prior to study periods and a significant positive relationship was observed when regional PM ( @ ) was high .
CONCLUSIONS	Exposure to traffic pollution may contribute to acute changes in blood pressure , autonomic and micro-vascular function in women .
CONCLUSIONS	Regional air pollution concentrations may modify the impact of these exposures on autonomic function .

OBJECTIVE	We previously reported a randomized , sham-controlled trial of @ Hz dorsolateral prefrontal left - and right-side repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) in @ participants with a medically refractory major depressive disorder .
OBJECTIVE	Depression improved most with right-side cranial stimulation , both rTMS and sham , and to a lesser degree with left rTMS .
OBJECTIVE	Because depression is often associated with cognitive impairment , in this study we sought to determine whether our earlier participants had treatment-induced changes in cognition , which cognitive domains ( language , executive , visuospatial , verbal episodic memory , attention ) were affected , and whether treatment-induced cognitive changes were related either to improvement in depression or to other treatment variables , such as right versus left treatment and rTMS versus sham .
METHODS	We used hierarchical regression analyses to determine how variables measured at baseline or associated with treatment affected changes in neuropsychological functions .
METHODS	The variables were neuropsychological function in the @ domains , severity of depression , change in depression with treatment , rTMS versus sham , laterality of stimulation , and rTMS-laterality interaction .
RESULTS	Compared to sham , right rTMS was associated with @ standard deviations greater gain in language function , @ standard deviations greater gain in visuospatial function , and @ standard deviations greater gain in verbal episodic memory than left rTMS .
RESULTS	These improvements did not appear to be directly related to the relief from depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that disorders of cognition and mood in depression may have different mechanisms , but right rTMS may treat both .
CONCLUSIONS	We propose potential mechanisms underlying the right-side rTMS effect .

METHODS	A total number of @ patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent TURP and @-nm diode vaporization of prostate in a balanced randomization ( @:@ ) from @ to @ and were followed up for @ months .
METHODS	Baseline characteristics of the patients , perioperative data , and postoperative outcomes were compared .
METHODS	The primary end point of the study was assessing the values of International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) , and maximum flow rate ( Qmax ) to predict the functional improvement of each group .
METHODS	The trial is registered at http://www.irct.ir ( number IRCT@N@ ) .
RESULTS	The mean age ( standard deviation ) of the patients was @ @ years in TURP and @ @ in diode groups .
RESULTS	In TURP and diode groups , the operation time was @ @ vs @ @ minutes ( P = @ ) , Foley catheterization time was @ @ vs @ @ hours ( P = @ ) and postoperative hospital stay was @ @ vs @ @ hours ( P = @ ) respectively .
RESULTS	Outcome with regard to increase in Qmax , decrease in IPSS , and decrease in postvoid residual urine volume showed a dramatic improvement in both groups during the first @ months .
RESULTS	In the TURP group , the values of IPSS and Qmax were respectively lower and higher than diode patients at @ and @ months of follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	According to our study , diode laser vaporization ( @ nm ) offers a safe and feasible procedure in the management of patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy ; however , at longer follow-up the functional outcome of diode laser vaporization has been less efficient than TURP .

BACKGROUND	Pharyngolaryngeal discomfort is a significant complication following the use of laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) .
BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to investigate the relation of LMA cuff pressure and the occurrence of pharyngolaryngeal discomfort during spontaneous ventilation ( SV ) , pressure support ( PSV ) and pressure control ventilation ( PCV ) .
METHODS	A hundred and twenty patients , ASA I-III , were included in this study .
METHODS	Originally the patients were divided into three groups : the @st group was left to breath spontaneously , the @nd group was placed under PSV while PCV was used in the @rd group .
METHODS	Each group was divided into two subgroups : A ) intervention group ( maintaining cuff pressure at @ cmH@O , measurement in @ min intervals ) and B ) observation group ( no intervention in cuff pressure , measurement in @ min intervals ) .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane in air/oxygen .
METHODS	Patients were assessed @ and @ hours post-surgery , for sore throat , dysphonia or dysphagia .
RESULTS	A and B subgroup comparison at @ hours revealed a statistically significant difference in the presence of pharyngolaryngeal discomfort in the PSV group ( @ % versus @ % respectively , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , when assessing the effect of maintaining a constant cuff pressure regardless of mode of ventilation , significantly fewer adverse effects were observed ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) when compared to the non-intervention subgroup .
CONCLUSIONS	Maintaining LMA cuff pressure in values which do not exceed @ cmH@O probably contributes in decreasing pharyngolaryngeal discomfort independently of ventilation mode .
CONCLUSIONS	The ventilation mode which leads to the highest incidence of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity when cuff pressures are not closely monitored is PSV .

BACKGROUND	Screening for vascular disease , risk assessment and management are encouraged in general practice however there is limited evidence about the emotional impact on patients .
BACKGROUND	The Health Improvement and Prevention Study evaluated the impact of a general practice-based vascular risk factor intervention on behavioural and physiological risk factors in @ Australian practices .
BACKGROUND	The primary aim of this analysis is to investigate the psychological impact of participating in the intervention arm of the trial .
BACKGROUND	The secondary aim is to identify the mediating effects of changes in behavioural risk factors or BMI .
METHODS	This study is an analysis of a secondary outcome from a cluster randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Patients , aged @-@ years , were randomly selected from practice records .
METHODS	Those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease were excluded .
METHODS	Socio-demographic details , behavioural risk factors and psychological distress were measured at baseline and @ months .
METHODS	The Kessler Psychological Distress Score ( K@ ) was the outcome measure for multi-level , multivariable analysis and a product-of-coefficient test to assess the mediating effects of behaviour change .
RESULTS	Baseline data were available @ participants in the intervention group and @ in the control group .
RESULTS	Twelve month data were available for @ in the intervention group and @ in the control group .
RESULTS	The K@ score of patients in the intervention group ( @ , SD @ ) was lower at @ months compared to the control group ( @ , SD @ ) .
RESULTS	K@ at @ months was significantly associated with the score at baseline and being unable to work but not with age , gender , change in behavioural risk factors or change in BMI .
CONCLUSIONS	The reduction of K@ in the intervention group demonstrates that a general practice based intervention to identify and manage vascular risk factors did not adversely impact on the psychological distress of the participants .
CONCLUSIONS	The impact of the intervention on distress was not mediated by a change in the behavioural risk factors or BMI , suggesting that there must be other mediators that might explain the positive impact of the intervention on emotional wellbeing .

BACKGROUND	Helicobacter pylori infection occurs more frequently in Arctic Aboriginal settings than elsewhere in North America and Europe .
BACKGROUND	Research aimed at reducing health risks from H pylori infection has been conducted in the Aboriginal community of Aklavik , Northwest Territories .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effectiveness of the Canadian standard therapy with an alternative therapy for eliminating H pylori infection in Aklavik .
METHODS	Treatment-naive H pylori-positive individuals were randomly assigned to a @-day regimen ( oral twice-daily doses ) with rabeprazole ( @ mg ) : standard triple therapy ( proton pump inhibitor , added clarithromycin -LSB- @ mg -RSB- and amoxicillin -LSB- @ g -RSB- -LSB- PPI-CA -RSB- ) ; sequential therapy ( ST ) added amoxicillin ( @ g ) on days @ to @ , and metronidazole ( @ mg ) and clarithromycin ( @ mg ) on days @ to @ .
METHODS	Participants with clarithromycin-resistant H pylori were randomly assigned to ST or quadruple therapy .
METHODS	Treatment effectiveness was estimated as per cent ( @ % CI ) with a negative urea breath test at least @ weeks after treatment .
RESULTS	Of @ ( @ PPI-CA , @ ST ) randomized participants , @ ( @ PPI-CA , @ ST ) had post-treatment results .
RESULTS	Per-protocol treatment effectiveness was @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for PPI-CA and @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for ST. Based on intention to treat , effectiveness was @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for PPI-CA and @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for ST. Of @ participants ( @ PPI-CA , @ ST ) with @ % adherence , effectiveness was @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for PPI-CA and @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) for ST.
CONCLUSIONS	While additional evidence is needed to confirm that ST is more effective for Arctic Aboriginal communities than the Canadian standard H pylori treatment , these results show standard PPI-CA treatment to be inadequate for communities such as Aklavik .

###24697979
OBJECTIVE	To assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between naproxen ( a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) and apixaban ( an oral , selective , direct factor-Xa inhibitor ) .
METHODS	In this randomized , three period , two sequence study , @ healthy subjects received a single oral dose of apixaban @mg , naproxen @mg or co-administration of both .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected for determination of apixaban and naproxen pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ( anti-Xa activity , international normalized ratio -LSB- INR -RSB- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation -LSB- AAI-PA -RSB- ) .
METHODS	Adverse events , bleeding time and routine safety assessments were also evaluated .
RESULTS	Apixaban had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetics .
RESULTS	However , following co-administration , apixaban AUC ( @ , ) , AUC ( @ , t ) and Cmax were @ % ( geometric mean ratio @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @ , @ ) , @ % ( @ ; @ % CI @ , @ ) and @ % ( @ ; @ % CI @ , @ ) higher , respectively .
RESULTS	Mean ( standard deviation -LSB- SD -RSB- ) anti-Xa activity at @h post-dose was approximately @ % higher following co-administration compared with apixaban alone , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ -RSB- IUml ( -@ ) , consistent with the apixaban concentration increase following co-administration .
RESULTS	INR was within the normal reference range after all treatments .
RESULTS	AAI-PA was reduced by approximately @ % with naproxen .
RESULTS	Co-administration had no impact beyond that of naproxen .
RESULTS	Mean -LSB- SD -RSB- bleeding time was higher following co-administration ( @ -LSB- @ -RSB- min ) compared with either agent alone ( @ -LSB- @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @ -RSB- min for apixaban and naproxen , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Co-administration of naproxen with apixaban results in higher apixaban exposure and appears to occur through increased apixaban bioavailability .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects on anti-Xa activity , INR and inhibition of AAI-PA observed in this study were consistent with the individual pharmacologic effects of apixaban and naproxen .

BACKGROUND	There is presently no approved single treatment for dual alcohol and nicotine dependencies .
OBJECTIVE	This pilot study investigated baclofen effects in alcoholic smokers .
METHODS	This was a preliminary double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical study with @ alcoholic smokers randomized to baclofen at @ mg/day or placebo .
METHODS	A subgroup ( n = @ ) participated in an alcohol cue-reactivity experiment .
RESULTS	Baclofen , compared with placebo , significantly decreased the percent days of abstinence from alcohol-tobacco co-use ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Alcohol dependence severity moderated baclofen effects , with the higher severity group having the greater baclofen response ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Although the percent days of alcohol-tobacco co-use declined in both groups , this decline was greater after placebo than baclofen ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Secondary analyses on alcohol or tobacco use alone suggested that the increase in percent days of co-abstinence was driven by the medication differences on heavy drinking days and on percent days smoking .
RESULTS	In the cue-reactivity substudy , baclofen slightly decreased alcohol urge ( p = @ ) and significantly reduced salivation ( p = @ ) , but these effects were not related to cue type .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting a possible role of baclofen in the treatment of alcoholic smokers .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the mixed results and the small sample require larger confirmatory studies .

OBJECTIVE	Questions have been raised regarding nephrotoxicity from vancomycin .
OBJECTIVE	A few small studies have shown that higher trough concentrations of vancomycin result in more nephrotoxicity .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate risk factors that may predispose patients to nephrotoxicity in those concomitantly receiving vancomycin .
METHODS	This was a single-center retrospective chart review conducted on adult subjects @ years and older who received at least three doses of vancomycin .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria included sepsis , septic shock , or acute renal failure or stage @ chronic kidney disease .
METHODS	Subjects were divided into two groups : those who developed nephrotoxicity and those who did not .
METHODS	Data collected included co-morbidities ( diabetes mellitus , hypertension , congestive heart failure ) , creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) , concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs , vancomycin trough concentrations , total daily dose , and duration of therapy .
RESULTS	Seventy-seven subjects were included in the nephrotoxic group and @ were in the control group .
RESULTS	The proportion of men in the nephrotoxic group was higher ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hypertension ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) , diabetes ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) , and furosemide use ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) were more common in the nephrotoxic group .
RESULTS	The proportion of subjects with baseline CLCR @ mL/min was higher in the nephrotoxic group .
RESULTS	Furosemide use ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , hypertension ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and vancomycin trough concentration @ g/mL ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) were each associated with nephrotoxicity during vancomycin therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	In summary , the patient profile exhibiting the greatest risk ( OR @ ) of developing kidney injury is one who has hypertension , is receiving furosemide therapy , and has vancomycin trough concentrations @ g/mL .

METHODS	We conducted a prospective , long-term follow-up study in @ patients with uncontrolled hypertension , CHD , and OSA randomized to control or CPAP groups .
METHODS	Daytime systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , and severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events ( SCCEs ) were recorded at baseline and follow-up .
RESULTS	Seventy-three patients completed the study with a median follow-up of @ ( interquartile range = @-@ ) months .
RESULTS	The @ groups had similar characteristics at baseline .
RESULTS	CPAP was used for @ hour/night .
RESULTS	SBP in the CPAP group was significantly reduced at follow-up ( @ mm Hg vs. @ mm Hg , P = @ ) , and SBP decreased by @mm Hg ( @ % confidence interval = @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hypertension control was improved ( CPAP , @ % for CPAP users vs. @ % for control subjects ; P = @ ) ; however , DBP did not reach statistical difference between the groups ( @ mm Hg vs. @ mm Hg ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the CPAP group , the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was markedly reduced ( @ vs. @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was @ SCCE in the CPAP group ( heart failure ) , and @ SCCEs in the control group ( acute myocardial infarction : @ ( with @ death ) ; stroke : @ ) , but there was no significant difference identified .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term CPAP application in uncontrolled hypertension with CHD and OSA significantly reduced daytime SBP , improved hypertension control and daytime sleepiness , and decreased the trend in SCCEs compared with control subjects .

BACKGROUND	Induction of labor , an increasingly common intervention , is often preceded by the application of an agent to `` prime '' or `` ripen '' the cervix .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare clinical , economic , and psychosocial outcomes of inpatient and outpatient cervical priming before induction of labor .
BACKGROUND	In this paper we present the psychosocial outcomes .
METHODS	Women participating in a randomized controlled trial in two Australian metropolitan teaching hospitals completed questionnaires to measure anxiety and depression at enrollment , and to examine satisfaction , experiences , depression , and infant feeding @ weeks after giving birth .
METHODS	Data analysis was by intention to treat and by having received the intervention as intended ( approximately @ % in each group ) .
RESULTS	Of @,@ eligible women , @ percent consented ( n = @ , outpatient ; n = @ inpatient ) .
RESULTS	No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were found in immediate anxiety , depression , or infant feeding .
RESULTS	Small , statistically significant differences favoring outpatient priming were found in seven of the nine subscales in the @-week postpartum questionnaire .
RESULTS	The direction of the effect was maintained , mostly with a larger effect size in women who received the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Women allocated to outpatient priming were more satisfied with their priming experience than women allocated to inpatient priming .
CONCLUSIONS	Being informed that they could go home after cervical priming did not increase women 's anxiety .

BACKGROUND	It has not been examined trialed whether obsessive compulsive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder respond to topiramate as an adjuvant treatment .
METHODS	This @-month double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial examined the efficacy and safety of augmentation with topiramat for treating the patients with bipolar disorder , manic phase type-I , and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms .
METHODS	Both groups received lithium + olanzapine + clonazepam .
METHODS	However , one group received topiramate and the other group placebo as adjuvant medications .
METHODS	Yale Brown obsessive compulsive behavior scale was used to assess the outcome .
METHODS	Adverse effects were also recorded .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients completed this trial .
RESULTS	The mean score decreased from @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) in the topiramate group ( P < @ ) and from @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) in the placebo group during this trial ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , @ ( @ % ) out of @ patients in the topiramate group and @ ( @ % ) out of @ patients in the placebo group showed more than @ % decline in YBOC score ( x@ = @ , df = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse effects were detected .
CONCLUSIONS	The limitations of the present study were its small sample size and the fact that it was conducted in a single center .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of lithium + olanzapine + clonazepam decreased the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder in the patients with bipolar disorder type I. However , topiramate had a more significant effect than placebo on improvement of the patients with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	This combination seems to be without serious adverse effects .

BACKGROUND	Avascular necrosis of femoral head ( ANFH ) is a progressive disease that often leads to hip joint dysfunction and even disability in young patients .
BACKGROUND	Although the standard treatment , which is core decompression , has the advantage of minimal invasion , the efficacy is variable .
BACKGROUND	Recent studies have shown that implantation of bone marrow containing osteogenic precursors into necrotic lesion of ANFH may be promising for the treatment of ANFH .
METHODS	A prospective , double-blinded , randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effect of bone-marrow buffy coat ( BBC ) grafting combined with core decompression for the treatment of ANFH .
METHODS	Forty-five patients ( @ hips ) with Ficat stage I to III ANFH were recruited .
METHODS	The hips were allocated to the control group ( core decompression + autologous bone graft ) or treatment group ( core decompression + autologous bone graft with BBC ) .
METHODS	Both patients and assessors were blinded to the treatment options .
METHODS	The clinical symptoms and disease progression were assessed as the primary and secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	At the final follow-up ( @ months ) , there was a significant relief in pain ( P < @ ) and clinical joint symptoms as measured by the Lequesne index ( P < @ ) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( P < @ ) in the treatment group .
RESULTS	In addition , @ % of the hips in the control group have deteriorated to the next stage after @ months post-procedure , whereas only @ % in the treatment group had further deterioration ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	More importantly , the non-progression rates for stage I/II hips were @ % in the treatment group and @ % in the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	Implantation of the autologous BBC grafting combined with core decompression is effective to prevent further progression for the early stages of ANFH .

BACKGROUND	Robotically facilitated therapeutic activities , performed in virtual environments have emerged as one approach to upper extremity rehabilitation after stroke .
BACKGROUND	Body function level improvements have been demonstrated for robotically facilitated training of the arm .
BACKGROUND	A smaller group of studies have demonstrated modest activity level improvements by training the hand or by integrated training of the hand and arm .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare a training program of complex hand and finger tasks without arm movement paired with a separate set of reaching activities performed without hand movement , to training the entire upper extremity simultaneously , utilizing integrated activities .
METHODS	Forty individuals with chronic stroke recruited in the community , participated in a randomized , blinded , controlled trial of two interventions .
METHODS	Subjects were required to have residual hand function for inclusion .
METHODS	The first , hand and arm separate ( HAS ) training ( n = @ ) , included activities controlled by finger movement only , and activities controlled by arm movement only , the second , hand and arm together ( HAT ) training ( n = @ ) used simulations controlled by a simultaneous use of arm and fingers .
RESULTS	No adverse reactions occurred .
RESULTS	The entire sample demonstrated mean improvements in Wolf Motor Function Test scores ( @ % ) and Jebsen Test of Hand Function scores ( @ % ) , with large effect sizes ( partial r@ = @ and r@ = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in improvement between HAS and HAT training immediately after the study .
RESULTS	Subjects in the HAT group retained Wolf Motor Function Test gains better than in the HAS group measured three months after the therapy but the size of this interaction effect was small ( partial r@ = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Short term changes in upper extremity motor function were comparable when training the upper extremity with integrated activities or a balanced program of isolated activities .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study of the retention period is indicated .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) was to investigate whether @-month continuous use of different manual toothbrushes ( TBs ) influences plaque removal and the degree of gingival inflammation compared to short utilization periods of @ weeks each .
METHODS	In total , @ participants were randomly allocated into two groups : continuous use during @ months ( non-renewal group ) or a change in TB every @ weeks during @ months ( renewal group ) .
METHODS	Each group was subdivided into four subgroups ( groups A to H ; n = @ each ) according to the head size ( normal or short ) and bristle hardness ( medium or soft ) of the TB used .
METHODS	The modified Quigley-Hein plaque index ( QHI ) , papilla bleeding index ( PBI ) , and gingival index ( GI ) were recorded at baseline and @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ weeks after baseline .
METHODS	After @ weeks , each participant received a new TB , and at week @ , the final QHI , PBI , and GI were determined .
METHODS	The statistical evaluation consisted of analysis of covariance ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	With time , QHI , PBI , and GI were significantly different between the renewal and the non-renewal groups ( QHI : P = @ ; PBI : P = @ ; GI : P < @ ) , independent of subgroup .
RESULTS	In the renewal group , QHI showed a significant decrease between baseline and each follow-up visit ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the non-renewal group , there was a significant decrease compared to baseline up to and including week @ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	PBI in the renewal group showed no significant differences between baseline and each follow-up visit ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	In the non-renewal group , only the normal head/soft subgroup exhibited a significant increase at week @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The GI in the renewal group showed no difference between baseline and all follow-up visits , whereas in the non-renewal group , there was a significant decrease up to and including week @ ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Six-month continuous use reduced the effectiveness of the TB with respect to plaque removal , and gingival inflammation appeared to increase .

BACKGROUND	Metformin is the only first-line oral hypoglycaemic drug for type @ diabetes recommended by international guidelines with proven efficacy , safety , and cost-effectiveness .
BACKGROUND	However , little information exists about its use in Asian populations .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the - glucosidase inhibitor acarbose , extensively adopted in China , compared with metformin as the alternative initial therapy for newly diagnosed type @ diabetes .
METHODS	In this @-week , randomised , open-label , non-inferiority trial , patients who were newly diagnosed with type @ diabetes , with a mean HbA@c of @ % , were enrolled from @ sites in China .
METHODS	After a @-week lifestyle modification run-in , patients were assigned to @ weeks of monotherapy with metformin or acarbose as the initial treatment , followed by a @-week therapy phase during which add-on therapy was used if prespecified glucose targets were not achieved .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were to establish whether acarbose was non-inferior to metformin in HbA@c reduction at week @ and week @ timepoints .
METHODS	The non-inferiority margin was @ % , with an expected null difference in the change from baseline to week @ in HbA@c .
METHODS	Analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry , number ChiCTR-TRC-@ .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients randomly assigned to treatment groups , @ patients started the intended study drug .
RESULTS	HbA@c reduction at week @ was -@ % in the acarbose group and -@ % in the metformin group .
RESULTS	At week @ , the HbA@c reduction was -@ % ( acarbose ) and -@ % ( metformin ) with difference @ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Six ( @ % ) patients in the acarbose group and seven ( @ % ) patients in the metformin group had serious adverse events , and two ( @ % ) and four ( @ % ) had hypoglycaemic episodes .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides evidence that acarbose is similar to metformin in efficacy , and is therefore a viable choice for initial therapy in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type @ diabetes .

BACKGROUND	Seasonal allergic rhinitis is typically poorly managed , particularly in adolescents , in whom it is responsible for considerable morbidity .
BACKGROUND	Our previous work has demonstrated that if poorly controlled this can impair educational performance .
OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of this trial was to assess the impact of a primary care-based professional training intervention on clinical outcomes in adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis .
METHODS	Cluster trial in which UK general practice staff were randomised to a short , intensive workshop on the evidence-based management of seasonal allergic rhinitis .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the change in the validated Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities ( RQLQ ( S ) ) score between baseline and @ weeks post intervention ( minimal clinically important difference = @ ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures of interest included health-care professionals ' knowledge and confidence in managing seasonal allergic rhinitis , number of seasonal allergic rhinitis-related consultations , relevant treatments prescribed and symptom scores .
RESULTS	Thirty-eight general practices were randomised ( @ in the intervention arm ) and @ patients ( @ % males , mean age @ years ) were included in the primary outcome analysis .
RESULTS	Health-care professionals ' knowledge and confidence of the clinical management of seasonal allergic rhinitis improved .
RESULTS	This did not , however , result in clinically or statistically significant improvements in RQLQ ( S ) : -@ , ( @ % confidence interval , -@ to +@ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in consultation frequency , treatments issued for seasonal allergic rhinitis or symptom scores .
CONCLUSIONS	Although associated with increases in professionals ' self-assessed confidence and understanding of seasonal allergic rhinitis management , this intensive training workshop did not translate into improvements in adolescents ' disease-specific quality of life or a reduction in rhinitis symptoms .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the extent to which individual and ecological-level cognitive and structural social capital are associated with common mental disorder ( CMD ) , the role played by physical characteristics of the neighbourhood in moderating this association , and the longitudinal change of the association between ecological level cognitive and structural social capital and CMD .
METHODS	Cross-sectional and longitudinal study of @ disadvantaged London neighbourhoods .
METHODS	We used a contextual measure of the physical characteristics of each neighbourhood to examine how the neighbourhood moderates the association between types of social capital and mental disorder .
METHODS	We analysed the association between ecological-level measures of social capital and CMD longitudinally .
METHODS	@,@ adults aged @-@ ( @ % men ) were randomly selected from @ disadvantaged London neighbourhoods .
METHODS	General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-@ ) .
RESULTS	Structural rather than cognitive social capital was significantly associated with CMD after controlling for socio-demographic variables .
RESULTS	However , the two measures of structural social capital used , social networks and civic participation , were negatively and positively associated with CMD respectively .
RESULTS	` Social networks ' was negatively associated with CMD at both the individual and ecological levels .
RESULTS	This result was maintained when contextual aspects of the physical environment ( neighbourhood incivilities ) were introduced into the model , suggesting that ` social networks ' was independent from characteristics of the physical environment .
RESULTS	When ecological-level longitudinal analysis was conducted , ` social networks ' was not statistically significant after controlling for individual-level social capital at follow up .
CONCLUSIONS	If we conceptually distinguish between cognitive and structural components as the quality and quantity of social capital respectively , the conclusion of this study is that the quantity rather than quality of social capital is important in relation to CMD at both the individual and ecological levels in disadvantaged urban areas .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , policy should support interventions that create and sustain social networks .
CONCLUSIONS	One of these is explored in this article .

BACKGROUND	Declining cognition is a risk factor for falls among older adults .
BACKGROUND	The extent to which impaired judgment in performance of daily activities increases fall risk is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine whether engagement in mobility activities in a risky manner explains the association between declining cognition and rate of falls .
METHODS	This study was a secondary analysis of baseline and prospective data from older adults enrolled in the intervention arm of a randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Two hundred forty-five community-dwelling older adults ( @ % female ; mean age = @ years , SD = @ ) who were at risk for falls received physical , cognitive , and functional evaluations .
METHODS	Cognition was assessed with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) .
METHODS	Using interview and in-home assessment data , physical therapists determined whether participants were at risk for falls when performing mobility-related activities of daily living ( ADL ) and instrumental ADL ( IADL ) .
METHODS	Falls were measured prospectively for @ year using monthly falls diaries .
RESULTS	Declining cognition was associated with increased number of mobility activities designated as risky ( @ % of mobility activities performed in a risky manner per SPMSQ point ) and with increased rate of falls ( rate ratio = @ for each unit change in SPMSQ score ) .
RESULTS	Risky performance of mobility activities mediated the relationship between cognition and rate of falls .
CONCLUSIONS	Risk assessment was based on the clinical judgment of experienced physical therapists .
CONCLUSIONS	Cognition was measured with a relatively insensitive instrument , and only selected mobility activities were evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	Engagement in mobility ADL and IADL tasks in a risky manner emerged as a link between declining cognition and increased number of falls , suggesting a mechanism through which the rate of falls may increase .
CONCLUSIONS	Specifically , declining cognition is associated with performance of mobility activities in an unsafe manner , thereby increasing the risk for falls .

BACKGROUND	Many studies have indicated that the reduced folate carrier gene ( SLC@A@ ) is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) .
BACKGROUND	However , the interaction between the SLC@A@ gene variant and maternal fever exposure and NTD risk remains unknown .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the risk for NTDs was influenced by the interactions between the SLC@A@ ( rs@ ) variant and maternal first trimester fever .
METHODS	We investigated the potential interaction between maternal first trimester fever and maternal or offspring SLC@A@ polymorphism through a population-based case-control study .
METHODS	One hundred and four nuclear families with NTDs and @ control families with nonmal newborns were included in the study .
METHODS	SLC@A@ polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism .
RESULTS	Mothers who had the GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever had an elevated risk of NTDs ( adjusted odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) as compared to absence of maternal first trimester fever and AA genotype after adjusting for maternal education , paternal education , and age , and had a significant interactive coefficient ( = @ ) between maternal GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever .
RESULTS	However , there was no interaction between offspring 's GG/GA genotype and maternal first trimester fever ( the interactive coefficient = @ ) after adjusting for confounding factors .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggested that the risk of NTDs was potentially influenced by a gene-environment interaction between maternal SLC@A@ rs@ GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal GG/GA genotype may strengthen the effect of maternal fever exposure on NTD risk in this Chinese population .

BACKGROUND	In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis , health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) has been shown to improve in parallel with improvement in disease severity .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the role of pruritus ( itch ) in mediating the relationship between improvements in disease severity and HRQOL .
METHODS	Data from a phase @ clinical trial , in which @ patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received ixekizumab or placebo , were used for this posthoc analysis .
METHODS	Relationships between improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) , Itch Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) , as well as in individual DLQI domains ( symptoms and feelings , treatment , work and school , daily activities , leisure , and personal relationships ) from baseline to week @ were determined .
METHODS	Multiple hierarchical linear regressions and Sobel tests were conducted to evaluate the results .
RESULTS	Improvement in PASI was highly correlated with pruritus improvement and improvements in DLQI total and domain scores at week @ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses showed a statistically significant ( P < @ ) association between improvement in pruritus and improvement in DLQI total score and each of the six DLQI domain scores after adjusting for improvement in PASI .
RESULTS	Sobel tests indicated that pruritus had a significant mediation effect ( P < @ ) on the association of PASI improvement with improvement in DLQI total score and all domains except the personal relationships score .
CONCLUSIONS	Pruritus appears to be an important mediator of the association between improvements in disease severity and HRQOL in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis .

BACKGROUND	Individuals with HIV infection and peripheral metabolic complications have impaired basal myocardial insulin sensitivity that is related to left ventricular ( LV ) diastolic dysfunction .
BACKGROUND	It is unknown whether interventions shown to be effective in improving peripheral insulin sensitivity can improve basal myocardial insulin sensitivity and diastolic function in people with HIV and peripheral metabolic complications .
OBJECTIVE	In a pilot study , we evaluated whether the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR - ) agonist pioglitazone or combined endurance and resistance exercise training improves basal myocardial insulin sensitivity and diastolic function in HIV + adults with peripheral metabolic complications .
METHODS	Twenty-four HIV + adults with metabolic complications including peripheral insulin resistance were randomly assigned to @ months of pioglitazone ( PIO ; @ mg/d ) or supervised , progressive endurance and resistance exercise training ( EXS ; @-@ min/d , @ d/wk ) .
METHODS	Basal myocardial substrate metabolism was quantified by radioisotope tracer methodology and positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging , and LV function was measured by echocardiography .
RESULTS	Twenty participants completed the study .
RESULTS	Neither PIO nor EXS resulted in a detectable improvement in basal myocardial insulin sensitivity or diastolic function .
RESULTS	Post hoc analyses revealed sample sizes of more than @ participants are needed to detect significant effects of these interventions on basal myocardial insulin sensitivity and function .
CONCLUSIONS	PIO or EXS alone did not significantly increase basal myocardial insulin sensitivity or LV diastolic function in HIV + individuals with peripheral metabolic complications .

OBJECTIVE	Child pedestrian injury is a global public health challenge .
OBJECTIVE	This randomized , controlled trial considered comparative efficacy of individualized streetside training , training in a virtual pedestrian environment , training using videos and Web sites , plus no-training control , to improve children 's street-crossing ability .
METHODS	Pedestrian safety was evaluated among @ @ - and @-year-olds using both streetside ( field ) and laboratory-based ( virtual environment ) trials before intervention group assignment , immediately posttraining , and @ months posttraining .
METHODS	All training groups received @ @-min sessions .
METHODS	Four outcomes assessed pedestrian safety : start delay ( temporal lag before initiating crossing ) , hits/close calls ( collisions/near-misses with vehicles in simulated crossings ) , attention to traffic ( looks left and right , controlled for time ) , and missed opportunities ( safe crossing opportunities that were missed ) .
RESULTS	Results showed training in the virtual pedestrian environment and especially individualized streetside training resulted in safer pedestrian behavior postintervention and at follow-up .
RESULTS	As examples , children trained streetside entered safe traffic gaps more quickly posttraining than control group children and children trained streetside or in the virtual environment had somewhat fewer hits/close calls in postintervention VR trials .
RESULTS	Children showed minimal change in attention to traffic posttraining .
RESULTS	Children trained with videos/websites showed minimal learning .
CONCLUSIONS	Both individualized streetside training and training within virtual pedestrian environments may improve @ - and @-year-olds ' street-crossing safety .

BACKGROUND	Although women with substance use disorders ( SUDs ) have high rates of trauma and posttraumatic stress , many addiction programs do not offer trauma-specific treatments .
BACKGROUND	One promising intervention is Pennebaker 's expressive writing , which involves daily , @-minute writing sessions to facilitate disclosure of stressful experiences .
METHODS	Women ( N = @ ) in residential treatment completed a randomized clinical trial comparing expressive writing with control writing .
METHODS	Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to document change in psychological and physical distress from baseline to @-week and @-month follow-ups .
METHODS	Analyses also examined immediate levels of negative affect following expressive writing .
RESULTS	Expressive writing participants showed greater reductions in posttraumatic symptom severity , depression , and anxiety scores , when compared with control writing participants at the @-week follow-up .
RESULTS	No group differences were found at the @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Safety data were encouraging : although expressive writing participants showed increased negative affect immediately after each writing session , there were no differences in pre-writing negative affect scores between conditions the following day .
RESULTS	By the final writing session , participants were able to write about traumatic/stressful events without having a spike in negative affect .
CONCLUSIONS	Results suggest that expressive writing may be a brief , safe , low-cost , adjunct to SUD treatment that warrants further study as a strategy for addressing posttraumatic distress in substance-abusing women .

OBJECTIVE	Collateral artery growth ( arteriogenesis ) is an important adaptive response to hampered arterial perfusion .
OBJECTIVE	It is unknown whether preventive physical exercise before limb ischemia can improve arteriogenesis and modulate mononuclear cell function .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed at investigating the effects of endurance exercise before arterial occlusion on MNC function and collateral artery growth .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of voluntary treadmill exercise , ligation of the right femoral artery was performed in mice .
RESULTS	Hindlimb perfusion immediately after surgery did not differ from sedentary mice .
RESULTS	However , previous exercise improved perfusion restoration @ days after femoral artery ligation , also when exercise was stopped at ligation .
RESULTS	This was accompanied by an accumulation of peri-collateral macrophages and increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) in hindlimb collateral and in MNC of blood and spleen .
RESULTS	Systemic monocyte and macrophage depletion by liposomal clodronate but not splenectomy attenuated exercise-induced perfusion restoration , collateral artery growth , peri-collateral macrophage accumulation , and upregulation of iNOS .
RESULTS	iNOS-deficient mice did not show exercise-induced perfusion restoration .
RESULTS	Transplantation of bone marrow-derived MNC from iNOS-deficient mice into wild-type animals inhibited exercise-induced collateral artery growth .
RESULTS	In contrast to sedentary controls , thrice weekly aerobic exercise training for @ months in humans increased peripheral blood MNC iNOS expression .
CONCLUSIONS	Circulating mononuclear cell-derived inducible nitric oxide is an important mediator of exercise-induced collateral artery growth .

BACKGROUND	Stopwatch-assessed duration of erection has been proposed as an objective and reliable efficacy end point for erectile dysfunction ( ED ) treatments .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to assess vardenafil orodispersible tablets ' ( ODTs ) efficacy in terms of duration of erection and ( i ) its correlation with other efficacy end points and male and female sexual quality of life ( QoL ) and ( ii ) its impact on intercourse duration .
METHODS	Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of vardenafil ODT @mg on-demand over @ weeks in @ patients with ED was carried out .
METHODS	Primary efficacy end points were stopwatch-assessed duration of erection ( min ) at any attempt and when leading to successful intercourse , and the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function ( EF-IIEF ) score .
METHODS	Secondary end points were sexual encounter profile ( SEP ) @ response rate and male sexual QoL .
METHODS	End points in participating women ( N = @ ) were stopwatch-assessed duration of intercourse and sexual QoL .
RESULTS	At week @/last observation carried forward , patients taking vardenafil ODT had longer duration of erections ( at any attempt or leading to successful intercourse ) vs. placebo ( least square meanstandard error @ minutes vs. @ minutes , and @ vs. @ minutes , respectively ) , and significant increases in EF-IIEF scores , the SEP-@ response , and all sexual QoL items .
RESULTS	An increased duration of intercourse was also observed .
RESULTS	Female sexual QoL improved significantly .
RESULTS	Both duration end points strongly correlated with EF-IIEF scores , and the three end points correlated well with SEP-@ response .
RESULTS	Correlation was good with sexual QoL scores in men and women and with duration of intercourse , with differences between treatment groups only for duration end points .
RESULTS	Safety was similar in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides further evidence for the consistency and reliability of the stopwatch-assessed duration of erection as an efficacy end point for ED treatments , with `` duration of erection leading to successful intercourse '' showing better properties than duration at any attempt .

BACKGROUND	Isoperistaltic stapled side-to-side anastomosis ( SSSA ) , which is a modified technique from conventional antiperistaltic SSSA , has the benefits of antiperistaltic SSSA but requires less intestinal mobility .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate short-term outcomes of isoperistaltic SSSA comparing them with antiperistaltic SSSA during colon cancer surgery .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patients with colon cancer who underwent elective curative resection and had enough intestinal mobility at anastomosis .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the presence of anastomotic failure , including leakage , hemorrhage , and stenosis .
RESULTS	Between July @ and January @ , forty patients were enrolled ( @ patients in each group ) .
RESULTS	The study was suspended on detecting excess morbidity in the isoperistaltic SSSA group .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in all preoperative backgrounds between the two groups .
RESULTS	Anastomotic leakage was seen in two patients in the isoperistaltic SSSA group , compared with none in the antiperistaltic SSSA group , although the difference was not statistically significant ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	One patient in the antiperistaltic SSSA group had anastomotic stenosis , which improved conservatively , compared with none in the isoperistaltic SSSA group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No anastomotic hemorrhage was seen in either group .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the median postoperative hospital stay ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study did not show any short-term advantage or disadvantage of isoperistaltic SSSA compared with that of antiperistaltic SSSA .
CONCLUSIONS	However , considering that anastomotic leakage occurred only in the isoperistaltic SSSA group , additional modifications are recommended to perform safe isoperistaltic SSSA for colon surgery .

OBJECTIVE	Does culture in a closed system result in an increased number of good quality embryos ( GQE ) on Day @ compared with culture in a conventional system ?
CONCLUSIONS	Culture in a closed system up to @ days after microinjection results in similar embryo development and morphological quality compared with culture in a conventional incubation system .
BACKGROUND	Time-lapse imaging ( TLI ) incubators are rapidly being introduced into IVF laboratories worldwide , despite the lack of large prospective randomized trials demonstrating improvement in embryo development or pregnancy rates .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial including @ patients ( @ cycles ) was conducted between May @ and February @ .
METHODS	After oocyte collection , randomization was carried out and all of a patients ' oocytes were allocated to culture in either a conventional incubator or a closed incubator system in proportion @:@ until embryo transfer on Day @ .
METHODS	A total of @ oocytes were injected and cultured in the closed system , and @ in the standard incubator .
METHODS	The primary end-point was the number of GQE in the two groups .
METHODS	In total , @ patients undergoing their first IVF cycle using ICSI , where at least one oocyte was retrieved , were randomized in a university hospital setting .
METHODS	Two hundred and forty patients were randomized for culture in a closed system and @ patients for culture in the conventional incubator system ( control group ) .
METHODS	Embryo assessments and final morphological scoring before transfer and cryopreservation were carried out at the same time points for embryos cultured in the conventional incubator and in the closed system .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the mean SD number of GQEs between groups : @ @ for the closed system group and @ @ for the control group ( P = @ , difference @ , @ % confidence interval @ ; -@ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found in the number of @-cell embryos , implantation - , pregnancy - or ongoing pregnancy rates .
RESULTS	A significantly higher miscarriage rate was found in the TLI group compared with the control group ( @ and @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Culture media , temperature and gas levels were similar in the open and closed incubator systems , but different culture dishes were used .
CONCLUSIONS	Culturing embryos for longer time period ( to the blastocyst stage ) may give different results .
CONCLUSIONS	Only ICSI patients were included , which may limit the generalizability of the results .
CONCLUSIONS	Finally , the number of GQEs on Day @ was used as a surrogate outcome for live birth .
CONCLUSIONS	The results are consistent with other , smaller randomized trials showing no difference in embryo quality when comparing culture in a conventional incubator with that of a closed TLI incubator system .

BACKGROUND	The European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) has shown significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality after @ years and @ years of follow-up , but screening is controversial because of adverse events such as overdiagnosis .
BACKGROUND	We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to @ , with analyses truncated at @ , @ , and @ years .
METHODS	ERSPC is a multicentre , randomised trial with a predefined centralised database , analysis plan , and core age group ( @-@ years ) , which assesses prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing in eight European countries .
METHODS	Eligible men aged @-@ years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention ( control ) .
METHODS	Investigators were masked to group allocation .
METHODS	The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation .
METHODS	Only incidence and no mortality data at @ years ' follow-up are reported for the French centres .
METHODS	This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	With data truncated at @ years of follow-up , @ prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and @ cases in the control group .
RESULTS	The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was @ ( @ % CI @-@ ) after @ years ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- including France ) , @ ( @-@ ) after @ years , and @ ( @-@ ) after @ years .
RESULTS	The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was @ ( @-@ ) after @ years , @ ( @-@ ) after @ years , and @ ( @-@ ) at @ years .
RESULTS	The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at @ years was @ per @ person-years or @ per @ men randomised , which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per @ ( @ % CI @-@ ) men invited for screening or one per @ ( @-@ ) additional prostate cancer detected .
RESULTS	After adjustment for non-participation , the rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was @ ( @ % CI @-@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this update the ERSPC confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of PSA , with a substantially increased absolute effect at @ years compared with findings after @ and @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite our findings , further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening .

OBJECTIVE	This secondary analysis investigated the impact of @ sessions of Seeking Safety ( SS ) on reducing posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms in a sample of dually diagnosed women with physical disabilities versus nondisabled ( ND ) women .
OBJECTIVE	SS is an evidence-based and widely implemented manualized therapy for PTSD and/or substance use disorder .
OBJECTIVE	It is a present-focused model that promotes coping skills and psychoeducation .
METHODS	As part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network ( NIDA CTN ) , @ participants with current PTSD and substance use disorder ( SUD ) were randomly assigned to partial-dose SS or Women 's Health Education ( WHE ) group therapy conducted in community-based substance abuse treatment programs .
METHODS	The women were categorized as participants with disabilities ( PWD ; n = @ ) or ND ( n = @ ) based on the question , `` Do you receive a pension for a physical disability ? ''
METHODS	PTSD was assessed on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) at baseline and follow-ups after treatment ( @ week , @ months , @ months , and @ months ) .
RESULTS	PWD experienced sustained reductions in PTSD symptoms when treated with SS but not WHE .
RESULTS	Indeed , PTSD symptoms of PWD in WHE returned to baseline levels of severity by @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	This pattern of results was not observed among ND women , who sustained improvements on PTSD in both treatment conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest strong potential for using SS to treat PTSD among women with physical disabilities , and speak to the genuine need to address trauma and PTSD more directly with PWD .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results are also consistent with other findings from the NIDA CTN trial , in which virtually all significant results evidenced SS outperforming WHE .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of sevoflurane or ketamine on the corrected QT ( QTc ) interval and the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave ( Tp-e ) during electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) in patients with major depression .
METHODS	This prospective , randomized , double-blinded study included @ patients that were randomly allocated to receive sevoflurane ( group S ) or ketamine ( group K ) for ECT session .
METHODS	Group S patients received @ % sevoflurane for anesthesia induction , which was maintained at @-@ % until delivery of the electrical stimulus .
METHODS	Group K patients received a bolus of ketamine ( @mg/kg ) .
METHODS	The mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) and the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) were recorded before ( T@ ) and after induction of anesthesia ( T@ ) and @ , @ , @ , and @min after the electrical stimuli ended ( T@ , T@ , T@ , and T@ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	In both groups , the QTc interval was significantly longer at T@ , T@ , T@ , and T@ than at baseline .
RESULTS	The QTc interval was longer at T@ , T@ , and T@ in group S compared to that in group K , the Tp-e interval was significantly longer at T@ in group K both baseline and group S.
RESULTS	The HR in group S was increased at T@ compared with group K. MAP was significantly higher after induction of anesthesia in group K compared to those in group S at all time points .
CONCLUSIONS	Although group S showed a prolonged QTc interval after ECT compared to group K , the Tp-e interval in both groups was not significantly affected clinically .
CONCLUSIONS	Sevoflurane blunted MAP and peak HR .

RESULTS	Between March @ and May @ , at @ centers in Canada and Europe , @ patients were assigned to receive fresh red cells ( fresh-blood group ) and @ patients were assigned to receive standard-issue red cells ( standard-blood group ) .
RESULTS	Red cells were stored a mean ( SD ) of @ days in the fresh-blood group as compared with @ days in the standard-blood group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ days , @ patients ( @ % ) in the fresh-blood group and @ patients ( @ % ) in the standard-blood group had died ( absolute risk difference , @ percentage points ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	In the survival analysis , the hazard ratio for death in the fresh-blood group , as compared with the standard-blood group , was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant between-group differences in any of the secondary outcomes ( major illnesses ; duration of respiratory , hemodynamic , or renal support ; length of stay in the hospital ; and transfusion reactions ) or in the subgroup analyses .
CONCLUSIONS	Transfusion of fresh red cells , as compared with standard-issue red cells , did not decrease the @-day mortality among critically ill adults .

BACKGROUND	Recent evidence suggests thyroidectomy ( Tx ) followed by radioiodine remnant ablation to be beneficial to Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO ) patients .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of ( @ ) I thyroid ablation after recombinant human TSH stimulation in patients with moderate-to-severe GO .
METHODS	The study was prospective , randomized , and single-blind , and it included @ consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe GO randomized into : @ ) a Tx-radioactive iodine ( RAI ) group ( @ subjects who underwent total-Tx and ( @ ) I ablation after recombinant human TSH stimulation ) ; and @ ) a Tx group ( @ subjects who underwent total-Tx alone ) .
METHODS	The overall GO outcome @ months after Tx/radioiodine ablation was the main measure .
RESULTS	GO evaluation at the end of iv glucocorticoids showed eye disease to be improved in @ % of the Tx-RAI group and @ % of the Tx group patients .
RESULTS	At @ and @ months , no further changes in the GO outcome could be observed in the Tx-RAI group .
RESULTS	Conversely , five patients from the Tx group exhibited a deterioration in GO .
RESULTS	At @ months , GO was found to be improved in @ % of the Tx-RAI and @ % of the Tx group patients , the latter being found to be stable ( @ % ) or worse ( @ % ) than at baseline evaluation .
RESULTS	At @ months , GO was found to be inactive in a significantly higher percentage of patients in the Tx-RAI than in the Tx group ( @ vs @ % ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Postoperative radioiodine ablation proved more effective than Tx alone in inducing earlier and steadier GO improvement in patients with moderate-to-severe GO treated with iv glucocorticoids over a @-month follow-up period .

BACKGROUND	Strains of @ distinct influenza B lineages ( Victoria and Yamagata ) have cocirculated in the United States for over a decade , but trivalent influenza vaccines ( TIVs ) contain only @ B-lineage strain .
BACKGROUND	Each season , some or most influenza B disease is caused by the B lineage not represented in that season 's TIV .
BACKGROUND	Quadrivalent influenza vaccines ( QIVs ) containing a strain from each B lineage should resolve this problem .
METHODS	This was a Phase III , randomized , multicenter trial in the United States among children @ months to < @ years of age to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated QIV compared with inactivated control TIVs containing opposite B-lineage strains .
METHODS	Participants were randomized at a ratio of approximately @:@:@ to receive QIV , TIV containing a Victoria-lineage B strain or TIV containing a Yamagata-lineage B strain .
METHODS	Sera were collected pre - and @-days post-final vaccination and safety was assessed for @ months after the last injection .
RESULTS	A total of @ participants were enrolled .
RESULTS	QIV induced noninferior antibody responses to all A strains and corresponding B strains compared with the control TIVs and superior antibody responses to the noncorresponding B strain in each TIV .
RESULTS	Rates of solicited reactions and unsolicited and serious adverse events were similar in all groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrated that QIV is safe and immunogenic among children @ months to < @ years of age .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings , along with data from @ other studies of this QIV in adults , suggest that QIV should offer protection against both B lineages with a safety profile similar to TIV across all ages .

BACKGROUND	The HPTN @ trial confirmed that antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) can nearly eliminate HIV transmission from successfully treated HIV-infected individuals within couples .
BACKGROUND	Here , we present the mathematical modeling used to inform the design and monitoring of a new trial aiming to test whether widespread provision of ART is feasible and can substantially reduce population-level HIV incidence .
RESULTS	The HPTN @ ( PopART ) trial is a three-arm cluster-randomized trial of @ large population clusters in Zambia and South Africa , starting in @ .
RESULTS	A combination prevention package including home-based voluntary testing and counseling , and ART for HIV positive individuals , will be delivered in arms A and B , with ART offered universally in arm A and according to national guidelines in arm B. Arm C will be the control arm .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint is the cumulative three-year HIV incidence .
RESULTS	We developed a mathematical model of heterosexual HIV transmission , informed by recent data on HIV-@ natural history .
RESULTS	We focused on realistically modeling the intervention package .
RESULTS	Parameters were calibrated to data previously collected in these communities and national surveillance data .
RESULTS	We predict that , if targets are reached , HIV incidence over three years will drop by > @ % in arm A and > @ % in arm B , relative to arm C.
RESULTS	The considerable uncertainty in the predicted reduction in incidence justifies the need for a trial .
RESULTS	The main drivers of this uncertainty are possible community-level behavioral changes associated with the intervention , uptake of testing and treatment , as well as ART retention and adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	The HPTN @ ( PopART ) trial intervention could reduce HIV population-level incidence by > @ % over three years .
CONCLUSIONS	This intervention could serve as a paradigm for national or supra-national implementation .
CONCLUSIONS	Our analysis highlights the role mathematical modeling can play in trial development and monitoring , and more widely in evaluating the impact of treatment as prevention .

BACKGROUND	Patients with Kawasaki disease ( KD ) are at risk for developing coronary artery lesions , but the association of noncoronary changes such as mitral regurgitation ( MR ) and/or pericardial effusion ( PE ) with cardiac mechanics in the acute phase of KD has not been previously described .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that these noncoronary markers for carditis are associated with abnormalities in strain ( ) and strain rate ( SR ) in patients with MR or PE not appreciated by conventional echocardiography .
METHODS	Longitudinal and circumferential and SR analyses were retrospectively performed on patients with KD .
METHODS	Patients with and without MR or PE were compared .
METHODS	Strain values were also compared between patients with and without coronary artery lesions .
METHODS	Values for ejection fraction , shortening fraction , and clinical laboratory parameters were correlated with MR or PE .
METHODS	Follow-up echocardiographic outcomes were recorded at the first encounter after initial diagnosis .
METHODS	Follow-up and SR data were also obtained in the group with MR or PE and altered ventricular mechanics at diagnosis .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients reviewed , @ had appropriate image quality for either longitudinal and SR or circumferential and SR analysis .
RESULTS	Twenty-eight patients ( @ % ) had either MR or PE .
RESULTS	Longitudinal and SR were significantly decreased in patients with MR or PE compared with patients without MR or PE ( : -@ % vs -@ % , P = @ ; SR : -@ vs -@ sec ( -@ ) , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference in longitudinal or SR was noted between patients with and without coronary artery lesions ( : -@ % vs -@ % , P = @ ; SR : -@ vs -@ sec ( -@ ) , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the group with abnormal coronary arteries , presence of MR or PE was correlated with decreased longitudinal ( -@ % vs -@ % , P = @ ) , without a significant difference in longitudinal SR ( -@ vs -@ sec ( -@ ) , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At approximately @-week follow-up ( @ days ) , longitudinal and SR for the group with MR or PE had increased significantly compared with diagnosis ( : -@ % vs -@ % , P = @ ; SR : -@ vs -@ sec ( -@ ) , P = @ ) , coincident with resolution of MR or PE .
RESULTS	In both groups , erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated ( @ mm/h vs @ mm/h -LSB- P = @ -RSB- and @ vs @ mg/dL -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ) , but only modest correlations were noted between longitudinal and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( r = @ , P = @ ; confidence interval , @-@ @ ) and C-reactive protein ( r = @ , P = @ ; confidence interval , @-@ @ ) in patients with MR or PE .
RESULTS	Shortening fraction and ejection fraction were within the normal range in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients presenting with KD with MR or PE at diagnosis are likely to have altered ventricular mechanics compared with patients with KD without MR or PE despite normal conventional echocardiographic measures of function .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no significant difference in ventricular mechanics when comparing patients with KD with coronary ectasia or aneurysms and those without coronary lesions .
CONCLUSIONS	Presence of abnormal in patients with KD with altered ventricular mechanics correlates modestly with laboratory inflammatory markers .
CONCLUSIONS	Peak systolic longitudinal and SR increased significantly at @-week follow-up compared with initial diagnosis , coincident with resolution of MR or PE .

OBJECTIVE	Central venous catheters for maintenance hemodialysis ( HD ) are designed to attain the required dialysis dose through sustained high blood flow rates ( BFR ) .
OBJECTIVE	The authors studied the immediate and long-term performance and complications of two twin-catheter systems , the Tesio catheter ( TC ) and the LifeCath Twin ( LC ) , to inform clinical practice .
METHODS	This single-center randomized controlled parallel-group trial allocated @ incident patients ( @:@ ) to receive either a TC ( MedComp ) or LC ( Vygon ) .
METHODS	Patients were dialyzed to target BFR @ mL/min and followed up for @ months .
METHODS	The primary outcome was achievement of target BFR during the first HD session .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included thrombotic dysfunction , displacement and catheter-related infection .
METHODS	Catheter dysfunction was defined by a BFR @ mL/min .
RESULTS	More LCs reached the primary endpoint ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) delivering a higher BFR ( mean @ vs. @ mL/min , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant differences in BFR persisted until the fourth dialysis session .
RESULTS	Rates of catheter-related bacteremia ( @ vs. @ / @,@ catheter days , p = @ ) and exit site infection were similar between groups ( @ vs. @ / @,@ catheter days , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall rates of catheter dysfunction were @ / @,@ catheter days ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , with no differences in thrombolytic lock use although the LC group required more thrombolytic infusions ( @ vs. @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The LC can deliver greater BFRs in the first three HD sessions following insertion although this did not translate into differences in performance , dialysis adequacy or complication rates with long-term use .
CONCLUSIONS	Both catheter types can consistently deliver high BFRs over an extended period of time .

BACKGROUND	Due to the steady increase of substance-dependent pregnant women the neonatal abstinence syndrome has become an increasingly important issue in neonatology .
BACKGROUND	The present study investigates site-specific differences of detailed symptoms and treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome within the context of an international multicenter clinical trial .
METHODS	Site specific neonatal data analyses from a prospective randomized , double-blind , double-dummy clinical trial ( MOTHER study ) was performed .
METHODS	A standardized NAS rating and treatment protocol was applied , while non-pharmacological care of NAS symptoms differed across the sites .
RESULTS	Urban US neonates exhibited most neurological symptoms ( p < @ ) while in Europe autonomous , respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were found significantly more often compared to urban and/or rural US ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Methadone produced significantly greater scores than buprenorphine in neurological , behavioural and respiratory symptoms regardless of the sites ( ps < @ ) .
RESULTS	NAS treatment rates in all site clusters were similar for methadone-exposed neonates , while in Europe significantly more buprenorphine-exposed neonates were treated ( p = @ ) than in US site clusters .
RESULTS	Urban US neonates had significantly higher NAS scores ( p < @ ) compared to rural US and European neonates , and needed significantly higher morphine doses ( p < @ ) with longer treatment duration .
RESULTS	Birth weight , length and head circumference did not differ significantly among the site clusters , but APGAR scores were significantly higher in European ( p < @ ) neonates .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition to intrauterine medication exposure other aspects such as different addiction severity of the mothers , different treatment modalities including rooming-in as well as the frequency of NAS ratings may be influencing the course of NAS .

BACKGROUND	Diabetes mellitus is a healthcare burden in India .
BACKGROUND	Seventy-four percent of India 's population lives in rural areas with limited access to healthcare resources .
BACKGROUND	Telemedicine can play a big role in screening people with diabetes at grassroots level .
BACKGROUND	In the telescreening model , single field @-degree photographs are used for detecting diabetic retinopathy .
BACKGROUND	The American Academy of Ophthalmology does not recommends single-field fundus photography as an adequate substitute for a comprehensive ophthalmic examination because it may lead to a higher rate of underdiagnosis .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a telescreening project using single-field fundus photography to determine its accuracy compared to the traditional camp-based screenings .
OBJECTIVE	In this project we compared the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy between an ophthalmologist-based and an ophthalmologist-led model on two different samples of people self-reporting with diabetes in rural South India .
OBJECTIVE	Between @ and @ in rural South India , @ people with diabetes mellitus underwent ophthalmologist-based diabetic retinopathy screening and @ people with diabetes underwent ophthalmologist-led ( telescreening ) diabetic retinopathy screening .
OBJECTIVE	The two population groups were randomly separated .
OBJECTIVE	In the ophthalmologist-based program , a trained retina specialist travels along with the camp team and screens patients at the camp site for diabetic retinopathy .
OBJECTIVE	In the ophthalmologist-led program ( telescreening ) , fundus photographs are transmitted to the base hospital for further evaluation and grading .
OBJECTIVE	A total of @ people ( @ % ) were diagnosed to have diabetic retinopathy in the ophthalmologist-based model , and @ people ( @ % ) in the ophthalmologist-led model p < @ ) .
OBJECTIVE	More sight-threatening retinopathies were found in the ophthalmologist-led model than in the ophthalmologist-based model ( @ % vs. @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The ophthalmologist-led ( telescreening ) model did not underestimate the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , because it obviates the need for travel by an ophthalmologist , it is a good method for diabetic retinopathy screening in rural areas of India .

BACKGROUND	Clinical trials traditionally use time-to-first-event analysis embedded within the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death ( CVD ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , or stroke .
BACKGROUND	However , many patients have > @ event , and this approach may not reflect overall experience .
BACKGROUND	We addressed this by analyzing all cardiovascular events in TRACER .
RESULTS	TRACER randomized @ @ patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes to placebo or to protease-activated receptor @ antagonist vorapaxar with a median follow-up of @ days ( interquartile range , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Analysis of vorapaxar 's effect on recurrent CVD , MI , or stroke was prespecified using the Wei , Lin , and Weissfeld approach .
RESULTS	Vorapaxar did not reduce the first occurrence of the primary endpoint of CVD , MI , stroke , revascularization , or rehospitalization for recurrent ischemia , but reduced the secondary composite endpoint of CVD , MI , or stroke ( @ % vorapaxar vs. @ % placebo ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ; number needed to treat -LSB- NNT -RSB- , @ ) .
RESULTS	Recurrent secondary events occurred in @ % of patients .
RESULTS	Vorapaxar reduced overall occurrences of ischemic events , first and subsequent ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ; NNT , @ ) .
RESULTS	Also , there was a trend indicating that vorapaxar reduced the expanded endpoint , including revascularization and rehospitalization for recurrent ischemia ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Vorapaxar increased overall occurrences of moderate and severe Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries bleeding ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction clinically significant bleeding ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Vorapaxar reduced overall occurrences of ischemic events , but increased bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	These exploratory findings broaden our understanding of vorapaxar 's potential and expand our understanding of the value of capturing recurrent events .

OBJECTIVE	The Euro-EWING@-R@ trial asked whether cyclophosphamide may replace ifosfamide in combination with vincristine and dactinomycin ( vincristine , dactinomycin , and cyclophosphamide -LSB- VAC -RSB- v vincristine , dactinomycin , and ifosfamide -LSB- VAI -RSB- ) after an intensive induction chemotherapy containing vincristine , ifosfamide , doxorubicin , and etoposide ( VIDE ) in standard-risk localized disease ( NCT@ ) .
METHODS	Standard-risk Ewing sarcomas were localized tumors with either a good histologic response to chemotherapy ( < @ % cells ) or small tumors ( < @ mL ) resected at diagnosis or receiving radiotherapy alone as local treatment .
METHODS	Patients entered the trial after six VIDE +@ VAI courses .
METHODS	Allocated treatment was either @ VAC courses with @ g/m ( @ ) of cyclophosphamide or seven VAI-courses with @ g/m ( @ ) ifosfamide .
METHODS	The limit of noninferiority was set at -@ % for the @-year event-free survival rate ( EFS ) , equivalent to @ in terms of the hazard ratio of event ( HR ( event ) ) .
RESULTS	This large international trial recruited @ patients between February @ and March @ ( n = @ receiving VAC and n = @ receiving VAI ) .
RESULTS	With a median follow-up of @ years , the @-year EFSs were @ % and @ % , respectively , the @-year EFS difference was -@ % ( @ % CI , -@ to @ % ) , the HR ( event ) was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) , and the HR ( death ) was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ; intention-to-treat ) .
RESULTS	The HR ( event ) was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) on the per-protocol population .
RESULTS	Major treatment modifications were significantly less frequent in the VAC arm ( < @ % ) than in the VAI arm ( @ % ) , mainly resulting from toxicity .
RESULTS	Patients experienced more frequent thrombocytopenia in the VAC arm ( @ % v @ % ) but fewer grade @ to @ acute tubular toxicities ( @ % v @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Cyclophosphamide may be able to replace ifosfamide in consolidation treatment of standard-risk Ewing sarcoma .
CONCLUSIONS	However , some uncertainty surrounding the noninferiority of VAC compared with VAI remains at this stage .
CONCLUSIONS	The ongoing comparative evaluation of long-term renal and gonadal toxicity is crucial to decisions regarding future patients .

OBJECTIVE	Recent data suggest that n-@ PUFA exert beneficial effects on endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) biology .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to investigate whether these effects might be mediated by enhanced EPC in vitro function and/or in vivo bioavailability .
RESULTS	CACs and late-outgrowth EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from @ donor buffy-coats .
RESULTS	The effect of n-@ PUFA ( EPA : DHA = @:@ ; @ M EPA plus @ M DHA ) was tested on CAC/EPC viability , function ( tube-formation ) and pro-inflammatory molecule expression .
RESULTS	Circulating EPC ( cells positive for CD@ , CD@ and kinase insert domain receptor - KDR cell-surface antigens by flow cytometry ) number was evaluated in @ healthy subjects ( @ F/@ M , @ @ years ) , randomized to receive @ mackerel or sardine portions per week for @ weeks followed by a @ week free-diet period .
RESULTS	N-@ PUFA improved CAC and late-outgrowth EPC viability ( p < @ ) and the capacity to form tube-like structures in CACs ( +@ % ; p < @ ) and late-outgrowth EPCs ( +@ % ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	ICAM-@ expression was reduced in both CACs ( p < @ ) and late-outgrowth EPCs ( p < @ ) and VCAM-@ in late-outgrowth EPCs ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	N-@ PUFA significantly decreased TNF - and MCP-@ expression in CACs and IL-@ , TNF - and MCP-@ in late-outgrowth EPCs ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Circulating EPC number significantly improved after @ weeks of a fish-enriched diet ( p < @ ) and returned to baseline levels after a @ week free-diet period ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Plasma EPA levels were independently and positively associated with EPC levels ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings support the case of a beneficiary role played by n-@ PUFA in EPC function and bioavailability .

BACKGROUND	Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation , there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at @years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial .
OBJECTIVE	We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment .
METHODS	Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least @weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at @ different clinical sites .
METHODS	Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site .
METHODS	Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort .
METHODS	Of those in the randomized cohort , @ of @ ( @ % ) provided @-year data and in the observational group @ of @ ( @ % ) .
METHODS	Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care .
METHODS	By @years , only @ of @ ( @ % ) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery , whereas @ of @ ( @ % ) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were SF-@ bodily pain , SF-@ physical function , and Oswestry Disability Index collected at @weeks , @months , @months , @months , and then annually .
METHODS	Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes : sex , herniation location , depression , smoking , work status , other joint problems , herniation level , herniation type , and duration of symptoms .
RESULTS	The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at @years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures .
RESULTS	Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness , leg pain , satisfaction with symptoms , and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover .
RESULTS	The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts , adjusted for potential confounders , showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures ; however , this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables .
RESULTS	Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall ( with surgery and nonoperative care ) but similar surgical treatment effects .
RESULTS	Patients with sequestered fragments , symptom duration greater than @months , those with higher levels of low back pain , or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The intent-to-treat analysis , which is complicated by high rates of crossover , showed no difference over @years for primary outcomes of overall pain , physical function , and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness , satisfaction with symptoms , and self-rated improvement .
CONCLUSIONS	Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI , higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy , a longer duration of symptoms , and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at @years .
METHODS	Level II , therapeutic study .

OBJECTIVE	One of the major challenges in peptic ulcer bleeding ( PUB ) is rebleeding which is associated with up to a fivefold increase in mortality .
OBJECTIVE	We examined if supplementary transcatheter arterial embolization ( STAE ) performed after achieved endoscopic hemostasis improves outcome in patients with high-risk ulcers .
METHODS	The study was designed as a non-blinded , parallel group , randomized-controlled trial and performed in a university hospital setting .
METHODS	Patients admitted with PUB from Forrest Ia - IIb ulcers controlled by endoscopic therapy were randomized ( @:@ ratio ) to STAE of the bleeding artery within @ h or continued standard treatment .
METHODS	Randomization was stratified according to stigmata of hemorrhage .
METHODS	Patients were followed for @ days .
METHODS	Primary outcome was a composite endpoint where patients were classified into five groups based on transfusion requirement , development of rebleeding , need of hemostatic intervention and mortality .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were rebleeding , number of blood transfusions received , duration of admission and mortality .
RESULTS	Totally @ patients were included .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients allocated to STAE @ underwent successful STAE .
RESULTS	There was no difference in composite endpoint .
RESULTS	Two versus eight patients re-bled in the STAE and control group , respectively ( Intention-to-treat analysis ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjustment for possible imbalances a strong trend was noted between STAE and rate of rebleeding ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	STAE is potentially useful for preventing rebleeding in high-risk PUB .
CONCLUSIONS	STAE can safely be performed in selected cases with high risk of rebleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed in order to confirm these findings ; ClincialTrials.gov number , NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Long-acting reversible contraceptive ( LARC ) methods , such as the intrauterine device and implant , are highly effective but used by less than @ % of US women .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of our study was to improve LARC interest by enhancing clinic counseling .
METHODS	A quality improvement methodology was used to evaluate intrauterine device service delivery in @ Chicago Title X clinics .
METHODS	To address identified barriers , we developed a theory-based iOS application ( app ) for patients to use in the clinic waiting room using human-centered design .
METHODS	The final prototype was tested in a randomized controlled trial in a Title X clinic with sexually active females ( @ % African American ) under age @ years .
METHODS	Our sample of @ was chosen to detect an increase from @ % ( baseline ) to @ % ( app intervention ) in the proportion of patients expressing interest in discussing a LARC method during their clinic visit with @ % power and two-sided = @ .
METHODS	After completing demographic and baseline knowledge questionnaires , participants were randomized @:@ to intervention ( app ) or standard care arms .
METHODS	App users also completed a posttest .
METHODS	Our primary outcome was expressed interest in discussing a LARC method during the clinic visit .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were contraceptive knowledge and LARC selection .
RESULTS	App testers ( n = @ ) preferred interactive , visually appealing design and video testimonials .
RESULTS	In the pilot randomized controlled trial ( n = @ ) , app users had a significantly higher knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness ( P = @ ) and increased interest in the implant ( @-@ @ % , P = @ ) after the intervention .
RESULTS	Users were highly satisfied with the app .
RESULTS	Staff reported no problems using the app in the clinic .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of a theory-based counseling app offers a novel method to optimize wait time while minimizing clinic flow disruption .
CONCLUSIONS	Preliminary data demonstrate that app use was associated with improvements in patients ' contraceptive knowledge and interest in the implant .

OBJECTIVE	Aging is associated with a blunted anabolic response to dietary intake , possibly related to a decrease in systemically available amino acids ( AAs ) , which in turn may stem from increased splanchnic AA metabolism .
OBJECTIVE	Splanchnic sequestration can be saturated by pulse feeding ( @ % of daily protein intake in a single meal ) , enabling increased protein synthesis .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to explore whether protein pulse feeding increased postprandial AA concentrations , and if so whether this increase persisted after @ wk of dietary treatment .
METHODS	This prospective randomized study enrolled @ elderly malnourished or at-risk patients in an inpatient rehabilitation unit .
METHODS	All were given a controlled diet for @ wk .
METHODS	In a spread diet ( SD ) group ( n = @ ) , dietary protein was spread over the four daily meals .
METHODS	In a pulse diet ( PD ) group ( n = @ ) , @ % of dietary protein ( averaging @ g/kg body weight daily ) was consumed in one meal at noon .
METHODS	The patients were evaluated on day @ and at @ wk for plasma postprandial ( five times from @ to +@ min ) AA concentrations ( expressed as area under the curve above baseline ) .
RESULTS	Protein pulse feeding was more efficient than protein spread feeding at increasing plasma postprandial AA concentrations , notably of essential AAs .
RESULTS	This increased postprandial AA bioavailability was maintained after @ wk .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates that increased postprandial AA bioavailability induced by protein pulse feeding persists after @ wk ( i.e. , that there is no metabolic adaptation blunting AA bioavailability ) .

BACKGROUND	Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) is a non-invasive technique used for modulating cortical excitability in vivo in humans .
BACKGROUND	Here we evaluated the effect of tDCS on behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of physiological sucking and swallowing .
METHODS	Twelve healthy subjects underwent three tDCS sessions ( anodal , cathodal and sham stimulation ) on separate days in a double-blind randomized order .
METHODS	The active electrode was placed over the right swallowing motor cortex .
METHODS	Repeated sucking and swallowing acts were performed at baseline and at @ and @ min after each tDCS session and the mean liquid bolus volume ingested at each time point was measured .
METHODS	We also calculated average values of the following electrophysiological parameters : @ ) area and @ ) duration of the rectified EMG signal from the suprahyoid/submental muscles related to the sucking and swallowing phases ; @ ) EMG peak amplitude for the sucking and swallowing phases ; @ ) area and peak amplitude of the laryngeal-pharyngeal mechanogram ; @ ) oropharyngeal delay .
RESULTS	The volume of the ingested bolus significantly increased ( by an average of about @ % compared with the baseline value ) both at @ and at @ min after the end of anodal tDCS .
RESULTS	The electrophysiological evaluation after anodal tDCS showed a significant increase in area and duration of the sucking phase-related EMG signal .
CONCLUSIONS	Anodal tDCS leads to stronger sucking of a liquid bolus in healthy subjects , likely by increasing recruitment of cortical areas of the swallowing network .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding might open up interesting perspectives for the treatment of patients suffering from dysphagia due to various pathological conditions .

BACKGROUND	Interactions between the microbial flora of the intestine and the human host play a critical role inmaintaining intestinal health and in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders such as antibiotic associated diarrhea , Clostridium difficile infection , and inflammatory bowel disease .
BACKGROUND	Prebiotics can confer health benefits by beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiome , whereas antibiotics can disrupt the microbiome leading to diarrhea andother side effects .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of the prebiotic , polysaccharopeptide from Trametes versicolor , to those of the antibiotic , amoxicillin , on the human gut microbiome
METHODS	Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive PSP , amoxicillin , or no treatment ( control ) .
METHODS	Stool specimens were analyzed using bTEFAP microbial ecology methods on seven occasions over @ weeks from each participant in the active treatment groups and on three occasions for the controls .
RESULTS	Twenty-two of @ participants completed the protocol .
RESULTS	PSP led to clear and consistent microbiome changes consistent with its activity as a prebiotic .
RESULTS	Despite the diversity of the human microbiome we noted strong microbiome clustering among subjects .
RESULTS	Baseline microbiomes tended to remain stable and to overshadow the treatment effects.Amoxicillin treatment caused substantial microbiome changes most notably an increase in Escherichia/Shigella .
RESULTS	Antibiotic associated changes persisted to the end of the study , @ days after antibiotic therapy ended .
CONCLUSIONS	The microbiomes of healthy individuals show substantial diversity but remain stable over time.The antibiotic amoxicillin alters the microbiome and recovery from this disruption can take several weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	PSP from T. versicolor acts as a prebiotic to modulate human intestinal microbiome composition .

METHODS	Prespecified secondary outcomes of the LIFE study included cognitive function measured by the Digit Symbol Coding ( DSC ) task subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( score range : @-@ ; higher scores indicate better function ) and the revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT-R ; @-item word list recall task ) assessed in @ participants ( @ % ) .
METHODS	Tertiary outcomes included global and executive cognitive function and incident MCI or dementia at @ months .
RESULTS	At @ months , DSC task and HVLT-R scores ( adjusted for clinic site , sex , and baseline values ) were not different between groups .
RESULTS	The mean DSC task scores were @ points for the physical activity group vs @ for the health education group ( mean difference , -@ points -LSB- @ % CI , -@ to @ points -RSB- , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean HVLT-R delayed recall scores were @ for the physical activity group vs @ for the health education group ( mean difference , -@ words -LSB- @ % CI , -@ to @ words -RSB- , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences for any other cognitive or composite measures were observed .
RESULTS	Participants in the physical activity group who were @ years or older ( n = @ ) and those with poorer baseline physical performance ( n = @ ) had better changes in executive function composite scores compared with the health education group ( P = @ for interaction for both comparisons ) .
RESULTS	Incident MCI or dementia occurred in @ participants ( @ % ) in the physical activity group and @ participants ( @ % ) in the health education group ( odds ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @ to @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among sedentary older adults , a @-month moderate-intensity physical activity program compared with a health education program did not result in improvements in global or domain-specific cognitive function .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of expert guided mentorship on technical score and time for a set of robotic training drills .
METHODS	Prospective randomized controlled trial ( Canadian Task Force classification I ) .
METHODS	Academic institution .
METHODS	Fifty trainees in robotic surgery .
METHODS	Inexperienced trainees underwent either a @-minute expert guided mentorship session or no intervention .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were technical score and time-to-drill completion for a set of dry lab robotic training drills evaluated at an initial and final skills assessment .
METHODS	The t-test , including paired analyses , was used to evaluate outcomes .
RESULTS	Forty-nine of @ trainees ( @ % ) completed the study .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in participant characteristics or initial performance between the @ groups .
RESULTS	During the final skills assessment , the intervention group demonstrated significantly better performance on @ of @ objective measures .
RESULTS	They had a higher mean score for the bead transfer drill when compared with the control group ( @ vs @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences in time-to-drill completion were noted between the @ groups .
RESULTS	Regardless of randomization , all participants had significantly improved scores for each of the drills on the final compared with the initial skills assessment ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although expert guided mentorship in a dry lab simulation environment seems feasible , further investigation is warranted before its widespread use because it may be more resource intensive than other teaching methods , without consistent objective improvements in technical performance .

OBJECTIVE	Lithium has been widely used to treat bipolar affective disorder for over @years .
OBJECTIVE	Still , its acute effects in human cerebral cortex are poorly understood .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed at investigating the acute effects of lithium on motor cortex excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) .
METHODS	Ten healthy young adults participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover study with four sessions , where a single oral dose of lithium carbonate ( @mg , @mg , or @mg ) or placebo was tested .
METHODS	Focal TMS of the hand area of left motor cortex was used to test resting and active motor thresholds , motor evoked potential input-output curve ( MEP IO-curve ) , slope of the MEP IO-curve and paired-pulse measures of intracortical inhibition and facilitation before , and two and four hours after drug administration .
RESULTS	Two hours post drug administration , @mg of lithium carbonate increased the slope of the MEP IO-curve while @mg tended to decrease it .
RESULTS	Lithium had no effect on motor thresholds , or intracortical inhibition or facilitation .
CONCLUSIONS	The acute effects of lithium on MEP IO-curve , a marker of corticospinal excitability , are consistent with an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings are important for our understanding of the therapeutic and toxic effects of lithium on the human central nervous system .

BACKGROUND	The rising number of children in daycare nurseries increases opportunities for the transmission of infectious diseases .
BACKGROUND	Pathogens may be transmitted directly from child to child via sneezing , coughing and touching , or indirectly via the environment .
BACKGROUND	Toys are among the fomites with the highest pathogen load , but their role in disease transmission is unknown .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if washing and disinfection of toys can reduce sickness absence and microbial pathogen load in the nursery environment .
METHODS	Twelve nurseries ( caring for @ children ) were randomized to intervention and control groups .
METHODS	The intervention consisted of washing and disinfection of toys and linen every two weeks for three months by a commercial cleaning company .
METHODS	The extent and causes of sickness absence among the children were recorded in both groups before and after introduction of the intervention .
METHODS	Ten sampling points in each nursery were examined for bacteria and respiratory viruses .
RESULTS	The presence of respiratory virus DNA/RNA was widespread , but very few pathogenic bacteria were found in the environment .
RESULTS	The intervention reduced the presence of adenovirus -LSB- odds ratio ( OR ) @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- , rhinovirus ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) and respiratory syncytial virus ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) compared with the control group , but the intervention had no effect on sickness absence or disease patterns in the nurseries .
CONCLUSIONS	Although cleaning and disinfection of toys every two weeks can decrease the microbial load in nurseries , it does not appear to reduce sickness absence among nursery children .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of somatostatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer who received D@ lymphadenectomy and vagina vasorum dissection .
METHODS	Using a prospective , single-blind , placebo-controlled design , patients with advanced gastric cancer were randomized into a study group ( n = @ ) and a control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Patients in the study group were given somatostatin for @-@ d starting @ h after the operation , and patients in the control group were given normal saline .
METHODS	Preoperative and nonoperative complications in the perioperative period , as well as different types of postoperative drainage in the two groups were compared .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the study group and the control group for preoperative clinicopathological indicators .
RESULTS	We found no significant difference between the two groups for the overall incidence of complications , but a lower percentage of peritoneal effusion was observed in the treatment group ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative pancreatic dysfunction and chylous fistula .
RESULTS	However , there were significant differences in the amylase concentration in drainage fluid , volume and duration of drainage , volume and duration of chylous fistula and peritoneal drainage , and volume and duration of gastric tube drainage .
RESULTS	The study group did not show any increase in mean hospitalization cost and the cost reduced when the postoperative complications occurred .
CONCLUSIONS	Postoperative somatostatin reduces volume and duration of surgical drainage and related complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Somatostatin may improve safety of gastric cancer surgery , reducing postoperative complications and promoting recovery .

BACKGROUND	mTOR inhibition reverses trastuzumab resistance via the hyperactivated PIK/AKT/mTOR pathway due to PTEN loss , by sensitising PTEN-deficient tumours to trastuzumab .
BACKGROUND	The BOLERO-@ study assessed the efficacy and safety of adding everolimus to trastuzumab and paclitaxel as first-line treatment for patients with HER@-positive advanced breast cancer .
METHODS	In this phase @ , randomised , double-blind trial , patients were enrolled across @ sites in @ countries .
METHODS	Eligible patients were aged @ years or older , with locally assessed HER@-positive advanced breast cancer , with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of @-@ , who had not received previous trastuzumab or chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer within @ months of randomisation , had measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) or bone lesions in the absence of measurable disease , without previous systemic treatment for advanced disease except endocrine therapy .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) with an interactive voice and web response system to receive either @ mg everolimus once a day orally or placebo plus weekly trastuzumab intravenously at @ mg/kg loading dose on day @ with subsequent weekly doses of @ mg/kg of each @ week cycle plus paclitaxel intravenously at a dose of @ mg/m ( @ ) on days @ , @ , and @ of each @ week cycle .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified according to previous use of trastuzumab and visceral metastasis .
METHODS	Patients and investigators were masked to the assigned treatments .
METHODS	Identity of experimental treatments was concealed by use of everolimus and placebo that were identical in packaging , labelling , appearance , and administration schedule .
METHODS	The two primary objectives were investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the full study population and in the subset of patients with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer at baseline ; the latter was added during the course of the study , before unmasking based on new clinical and biological findings from other studies .
METHODS	All efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	Enrolment for this trial is closed and results of the final progression-free survival analyses are presented here .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between Sept @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive everolimus ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) .
RESULTS	In the full population , median progression-free survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) with everolimus versus @ months ( @-@ ) with placebo ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the HR-negative subpopulation ( n = @ ) , median progression-free survival with everolimus was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) versus @ months ( @-@ ) with placebo ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) ; however , the protocol-specified significance threshold ( p = @ ) was not crossed .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events with everolimus were stomatitis ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients in the everolimus group vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients in the placebo group ) , diarrhoea ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) , and alopecia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	The most frequently reported grade @ or @ adverse events in the everolimus group versus the placebo group were neutropenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , stomatitis ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs three -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , anaemia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs six -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) and diarrhoea ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) On-treatment adverse event-related deaths were reported in @ ( @ % ) patients in the everolimus group and none in the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	Although progression-free survival was not significantly different between groups in the full analysis population , the @ months prolongation we noted with the addition of everolimus in the HR-negative , HER@-positive population warrants further investigation , even if it did not meet prespecified criteria for significance .
CONCLUSIONS	The safety profile was generally consistent with what was previously reported in BOLERO-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Proactive monitoring and early management of adverse events in patients given everolimus and chemotherapy is crucial .

BACKGROUND	The most prevalent phenotype of asthma is characterized by eosinophil-dominated inflammation that is driven by a type @ helper T cell ( Th@ ) .
BACKGROUND	Therapeutic targeting of GATA@ , an important transcription factor of the Th@ pathway , may be beneficial .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of SB@ , a novel DNA enzyme ( DNAzyme ) that is able to cleave and inactivate GATA@ messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter clinical trial of SB@ involving patients who had allergic asthma with sputum eosinophilia and who also had biphasic early and late asthmatic responses after laboratory-based allergen provocation .
METHODS	A total of @ patients could be evaluated ; @ were assigned to receive @ mg of SB@ , and @ were assigned to receive placebo , with each study drug administered by means of inhalation once daily for @ days .
METHODS	An allergen challenge was performed before and after the @-day period .
METHODS	The primary end point was the late asthmatic response as quantified by the change in the area under the curve ( AUC ) for forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) .
RESULTS	After @ days , SB@ attenuated the mean late asthmatic response by @ % , as compared with the baseline response , according to the AUC for FEV@ , whereas placebo was associated with a @ % increase in the AUC for FEV@ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The early asthmatic response with SB@ was attenuated by @ % as measured by the AUC for FEV@ , whereas the early response with placebo was increased by @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Inhibition of the late asthmatic response by SB@ was associated with attenuation of allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia and with lower levels of tryptase in sputum and lower plasma levels of interleukin-@ .
RESULTS	Allergen-induced levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine were not affected by either SB@ or placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with SB@ significantly attenuated both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen provocation in patients with allergic asthma .

BACKGROUND	Odanacatib is a cathepsin K inhibitor in development for the treatment of osteoporosis .
BACKGROUND	Evaluation of therapies to ensure that treatment effects are relevant regardless of sex is clinically important .
METHODS	In this double-blind , randomized controlled trial , older men ( aged @-@ years ) and postmenopausal women ( aged @-@ years ) were given odanacatib @ mg once weekly or placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) evaluation measured weighted average inhibition ( WAI ) of urine amino-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen/creatinine ( uNTx/Cr ) after odanacatib administration .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter data were collected , and an analysis of sex as a factor in the PK/PD relationship was conducted .
METHODS	Adverse events were monitored .
METHODS	The hypotheses were that WAI of uNTx/Cr would be > @ % ( including > @ % for the lower limit of the @ % confidence intervals -LSB- CIs -RSB- ) for older men and postmenopausal women , that there would be no important differences in area under the curve from @ to @ hours ( AUC@-@ h ) between men and women , and that odanacatib would be safe and well tolerated .
RESULTS	A total of @ subjects ( @ men and @ women ) were randomized .
RESULTS	The least squares mean WAI ( uNTx/Cr ) at week @ was @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) for men and @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) for women ; mean values were > @ % , but lower bounds were < @ % as prespecified in the primary hypothesis .
RESULTS	The differences among men and women in PD parameters were not meaningful ( @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	PK parameters for both groups were comparable ( geometric mean ratio of AUC@-@ h , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	A PK/PD analysis found that the EC@ and maximum fractional inhibition were similar in male and female subjects .
RESULTS	There were no notable or serious adverse events in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the primary hypothesis was not met , there were no clinically meaningful differences in PD , PK , or PK/PD parameters between older men and postmenopausal women , supporting further research on odanacatib ( @ mg once weekly ) as a treatment for male osteoporosis .
CONCLUSIONS	Odanacatib was generally well tolerated .

###25442801
OBJECTIVE	The progressive changes in lung morphology observed in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) can potentially affect the statistical distribution of computed tomography ( CT ) density values .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to characterize the lung CT density distributions by quantifying indices of the kurtosis and skewness of the lung density distribution and to compare these indices to radiologic scores and lung function parameters in children and young adults with CF.
METHODS	CT scans and lung function of @ patients with CF were retrospectively examined .
METHODS	The Bhalla radiologic scoring was performed separately , in random order , by two expert radiologists , blinded to the patient 's identity , age , clinical status , results of lung function tests , and the other paired observer 's score .
RESULTS	Positive relations were evidenced between the log indices of lung density distribution kurtosis ( iKurtosis ) and the overall radiologic scores ( RS ) of both observers ( R = @ ; P < @ vs RS@ and R = @ ; P < @ vs RS@ ) .
RESULTS	A similar relationship was evidenced with the log index of the degree of distribution asymmetry ( iSkewness ; R = @ ; P < @ vs RS@ and R = @ ; P < @ vs RS@ ) .
RESULTS	Log-iKurtosis and log-iSkewness were related to FEV@ ( R = -@ ; P < @ ( -@ ) and R = -@ ; P < @ ( -@ ) ) and to residual volume ( R = @ ; P < @ and R = @ ; P < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Both radiologic scores showed significant relation with lung function .
RESULTS	The correlation between RS@ and RS@ was excellent ( R = @ ) , with a Cohen weighted kappa of @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Characteristic indices of lung CT density distribution are correlated to lung function and radiologic scores in patients with CF and merit further evaluation as part of more comprehensive automated methods for quantifying CF lung CT data .

OBJECTIVE	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is difficult to treat , and standard therapy does not always induce remission .
OBJECTIVE	Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) is an alternative approach that induced remission in small series of patients with active UC .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated its safety and efficacy in a placebo-controlled randomized trial .
METHODS	We performed a parallel study of patients with active UC without infectious diarrhea .
METHODS	Participants were examined by flexible sigmoidoscopy when the study began and then were randomly assigned to groups that received FMT ( @ mL , via enema , from healthy anonymous donors ; n = @ ) or placebo ( @ mL water enema ; n = @ ) once weekly for @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients , clinicians , and investigators were blinded to the groups .
METHODS	The primary outcome was remission of UC , defined as a Mayo score @ with an endoscopic Mayo score of @ , at week @ .
METHODS	Patients provided stool samples when the study began and during each week of FMT for microbiome analysis .
METHODS	The trial was stopped early for futility by the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee , but all patients already enrolled in the trial were allowed to complete the study .
RESULTS	Seventy patients completed the trial ( @ dropped out from the placebo group and @ from the FMT group ) .
RESULTS	Nine patients who received FMT ( @ % ) and @ who received placebo ( @ % ) were in remission at @ weeks ( a statistically significant difference in risk of @ % ; @ % confidence interval , @ % -@ % ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in adverse events between groups .
RESULTS	Seven of the @ patients in remission after FMT received fecal material from a single donor .
RESULTS	Three of the @ patients with UC @ year entered remission , compared with @ of @ of those with UC > @ year ( P = @ , Fisher 's exact test ) .

BACKGROUND	Critically ill patients often require renal replacement therapy accompanied by thrombocytopenia .
BACKGROUND	Thrombocytopenia during heparin anticoagulation may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with need for alternative anticoagulation .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we compared argatroban and lepirudin in critically ill surgical patients .
METHODS	Following institutional review board approval and written informed consent , critically ill surgical patients more than or equal to @ years with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , were randomly assigned to receive double-blind argatroban or lepirudin anticoagulation targeting an activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) of @ to @ times baseline .
METHODS	In patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy we compared the life-time of hemodialysis filters .
METHODS	We evaluated in all patients the incidence of bleeding and thrombembolic events .
RESULTS	We identified @ patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , including @ requiring renal replacement therapy .
RESULTS	Mean filter lifetimes did not differ between groups ( argatroban @ hours ( n = @ ) versus lepirudin @ hours ( n = @ ) , mean difference @ hours , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among all @ patients , relevant bleeding occurred in four argatroban - versus eleven lepirudin-patients ( OR @ , @ % CI @ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the argatroban-group , three thromboembolic events occurred compared to two in the lepirudin group ( OR @ , @ % CI @ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was @ % ( n = @ ) in our study population .
CONCLUSIONS	This first randomized controlled double-blind trial comparing two direct thrombin inhibitors showed comparable effectiveness for renal replacement therapy , but suggests fewer bleeds in surgical patients with argatroban anticoagulation .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to assess the prognostic value of physical examination in a modern treated heart failure population .
BACKGROUND	The physical examination is the cornerstone of the evaluation and monitoring of patients with heart failure .
BACKGROUND	Yet , the prognostic value of congestive signs ( i.e. , peripheral edema , jugular venous distension , a third heart sound , and pulmonary rales ) has not been assessed in the current era .
METHODS	A post-hoc analysis was conducted on all @,@ patients , @ % male , mean age @ @ years , with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction enrolled in the AF-CHF ( Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure ) trial .
METHODS	The prognostic value of baseline physical examination findings was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses .
RESULTS	Peripheral edema was observed in @ ( @ % ) , jugular venous distension in @ ( @ % ) , a third heart sound in @ ( @ % ) , and pulmonary rales in @ ( @ % ) patients .
RESULTS	Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in @ ( @ % ) patients over a mean follow-up of @ @ months .
RESULTS	All @ physical examination findings were associated with cardiovascular mortality in univariate analyses ( all p values < @ ) .
RESULTS	In multivariate analyses , taking all @ signs as potential covariates , only rales ( hazard ratio @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p = @ ) and peripheral edema ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p = @ ) were associated with cardiovascular mortality , independent of other variables .
CONCLUSIONS	In the modern era , congestive signs on the physical examination ( i.e. , peripheral edema , jugular venous distension , a third heart sound , and pulmonary rales ) continue to provide important prognostic information in patients with congestive heart failure .

OBJECTIVE	Gastric cancers may harbor a subset of cells with cancer stem cell ( CSC ) properties , including chemotherapy resistance , and CD@ is a gastric CSC marker .
OBJECTIVE	The Hedgehog ( HH ) pathway is a key developmental pathway that can be subverted by CSCs during tumorigenesis .
OBJECTIVE	Here , we examine the role of HH signaling in CD@ ( + ) gastric cancer cells .
METHODS	Gastric cancer cell lines , tumor xenografts , and patient tumors were examined .
RESULTS	Gastric cancer cell lines AGS , MKN-@ , and NCI-N@ grown as spheroids or sorted for CD@ ( + ) were found to have upregulation of HH pathway proteins .
RESULTS	HH inhibition using Smoothened ( Smo ) shRNA or vismodegib ( VIS ) decreased spheroid formation and colony formation .
RESULTS	CD@ ( + ) cells , compared with unselected cells , were also resistant to @-fluorouracil and cisplatin chemotherapy , and this resistance was reversed in vitro and in xenografts with Smo shRNA or VIS .
RESULTS	CD@ ( + ) cells also had significantly more migration , invasion , and anchorage-independent growth , and these properties could all be blocked with HH inhibition .
RESULTS	Clinical tumor samples from a phase II trial of chemotherapy with or without VIS for advanced gastric cancer were analyzed for CD@ expression .
RESULTS	In the chemotherapy alone group , high CD@ expression was associated with decreased survival , whereas in the chemotherapy plus VIS group , high CD@ expression was associated with improved survival .
CONCLUSIONS	HH signaling maintains CSC phenotypes and malignant transformation phenotypes in CD@ ( + ) gastric cancer cells , and HH inhibition can reverse chemotherapy resistance in CD@ ( + ) cells .
CONCLUSIONS	Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease , and the strategy of combining chemotherapy with HH inhibition may only be effective in tumors with high CD@ levels .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to test @ hypotheses : @ ) fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) -@ identifies patients with stable ischemic heart disease ( SIHD ) at high risk of cardiovascular events independent of clinical factors , renal function , and established cardiovascular biomarkers ; and @ ) FGF-@ identifies patients who derive greater clinical benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy .
BACKGROUND	FGF-@ is an endocrine regulator of mineral metabolism and markedly elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease .
BACKGROUND	Data in patients with SIHD are more sparse .
METHODS	FGF-@ levels were measured in @,@ patients with SIHD randomly assigned to trandolapril or placebo within the PEACE ( Prevention of Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme ) trial and followed up for a median of @ years .
RESULTS	After adjustment for clinical risk predictors , left ventricular ejection fraction , markers of renal function , and established cardiovascular biomarkers , FGF-@ concentration was independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure among patients allocated to placebo ( quartile @ hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; p = @ ) and significantly improved metrics of discrimination .
RESULTS	Furthermore , among patients in the top quartile of FGF-@ levels , trandolapril significantly reduced cardiovascular death or incident heart failure ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ) , whereas there was no clinical benefit in the remaining patients ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	This interaction was independent of and additive to stratification based on renal function .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated levels of FGF-@ are associated with cardiovascular death and incident heart failure in patients with SIHD and identify patients who derive significant clinical benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy regardless of renal function .
CONCLUSIONS	( Prevention of Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Therapy -LSB- PEACE -RSB- : NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	One of the most common symptoms observed in patients with dementia is agitation , and several non-pharmacological treatments have been used to control this symptom .
BACKGROUND	However , because of limitations in research design , the benefit of non-pharmacological treatments has only been demonstrated in certain cases .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy with respect to their effects on agitation in patients with dementia .
METHODS	In this experimental study , the participants were randomly assigned to three groups : @ patients were included in the aroma-acupressure group , @ patients in the aromatherapy group , and @ patients in the control group who received daily routine as usual without intervention .
METHODS	The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ) scale and the heart rate variability ( HRV ) index were used to assess differences in agitation .
METHODS	The CMAI was used in the pre-test , post-test and post-three-week test , and the HRV was used in the pre-test , the post-test and the post-three-week test as well as every week during the four-week interventions .
RESULTS	The CMAI scores were significantly lower in the aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy groups compared with the control group in the post-test and post-three-week assessments .
RESULTS	Sympathetic nervous activity was significantly lower in the fourth week in the aroma-acupressure group and in the second week in the aromatherapy group , whereas parasympathetic nervous activity increased from the second week to the fourth week in the aroma-acupressure group and in the fourth week in the aromatherapy group .
CONCLUSIONS	Aroma-acupressure had a greater effect than aromatherapy on agitation in patients with dementia .
CONCLUSIONS	However , agitation was improved in both of the groups , which allowed the patients with dementia to become more relaxed .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should continue to assess the benefits of aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy for the treatment of agitation in dementia patients .

BACKGROUND	Existing psychological therapies for bipolar disorders have been found to have mixed results , with a consensus that they provide a significant , but modest , effect on clinical outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Typically , these approaches have focused on promoting strategies to prevent future relapse .
BACKGROUND	An alternative treatment approach , termed ` Think Effectively About Mood Swings ' ( TEAMS ) addresses current symptoms , including subclinical hypomania , depression and anxiety , and promotes long-term recovery .
BACKGROUND	Following the publication of a theoretical model , a range of research studies testing the model and a case series have demonstrated positive results .
BACKGROUND	The current study reports the protocol of a feasibility randomized controlled trial to inform a future multi-centre trial .
METHODS	A target number of @ patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder , or bipolar disorder not-otherwise-specified are screened , allocated to a baseline assessment and randomized to either @ sessions of TEAMS therapy plus treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) or TAU .
METHODS	Patients complete self-report inventories of depression , anxiety , recovery status and bipolar cognitions targeted by TEAMS .
METHODS	Assessments of diagnosis , bipolar symptoms , medication , access to services and quality of life are conducted by assessors blind to treatment condition at @ , @ , @ and @ months post-randomization .
METHODS	The main aim is to evaluate recruitment and retention of participants into both arms of the study , as well as adherence to therapy , to determine feasibility and acceptability .
METHODS	It is predicted that TEAMS plus TAU will reduce self-reported depression in comparison to TAU alone at six months post-randomization .
METHODS	The secondary hypotheses are that TEAMS will reduce the severity of hypomanic symptoms and anxiety , reduce bipolar cognitions , improve social functioning and promote recovery compared to TAU alone at post-treatment and follow-up .
METHODS	The study also incorporates semi-structured interviews about the experiences of previous treatment and the experience of TEAMS therapy that will be subject to qualitative analyses to inform future developments of the approach .
CONCLUSIONS	The design will provide preliminary evidence of efficacy , feasibility , acceptability , uptake , attrition and barriers to treatment to design a definitive trial of this novel intervention compared to treatment as usual .

BACKGROUND	The incidence of vulvodynia in American women has been reported to be between @ % and @ % .
BACKGROUND	However , there is no consistently effective standardized treatment for vulvodynia .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the feasibility and potential effects of using a standardized acupuncture protocol for the treatment of women with vulvodynia .
METHODS	The primary outcome was vulvar pain , and sexual function was the secondary outcome .
METHODS	Pain was assessed by the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire , and function was measured by the Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) .
METHODS	Thirty-six women with vulvodynia met inclusion criteria .
METHODS	The women were randomly assigned either to the acupuncture group or to the wait-list control group .
METHODS	The @ subjects assigned to the acupuncture group received acupuncture two times per week for @ weeks for a total of @ sessions .
RESULTS	Reports of vulvar pain and dyspareunia were significantly reduced , whereas changes in the aggregate FSFI scores suggest significant improvement in sexual functioning in those receiving acupuncture vs. those who did not .
RESULTS	Acupuncture did not significantly increase sexual desire , sexual arousal , lubrication , ability to orgasm or sexual satisfaction in women with vulvodynia .
CONCLUSIONS	This was the first randomized controlled pilot study to examine the use of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia .
CONCLUSIONS	The acupuncture protocol was feasible and in this small sample appeared to reduce vulvar pain and dyspareunia with an increase in overall sexual function for women with vulvodynia .
CONCLUSIONS	This study should be replicated in a larger double-blinded randomized controlled trial .

BACKGROUND	Transient receptor potential vanilloid type @ ( TRPV@ ) is a non-selective cation channel widely expressed in skin tissues , and peripheral sensory nerve fibres .
BACKGROUND	Activation of TRPV@ releases neuropeptides ; the resulting neurogenic inflammation is believed to contribute to the development of pruritus .
BACKGROUND	A TRPV@ antagonist has the potential to perform as an anti-pruritic agent .
BACKGROUND	SB@ is a TRPV@ antagonist that has demonstrated in vitro activity against cloned TRPV@ human receptors and when orally administered has demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in animal models and clinical studies .
OBJECTIVE	To select a topical dose of SB@ using the TRPV@ agonist capsaicin ; to confirm engagement of the TRPV@ antagonistic action of SB@ and assess whether the dose selected has an effect on itch induced by two challenge agents .
METHODS	A clinical study was conducted in @ healthy volunteers to assess the effects of @ doses of SB@ on skin flare induced by capsaicin .
METHODS	Subjects with a robust capsaicin response were chosen to determine if the selected topical formulation of SB@ had an effect on challenge agent induced itch .
RESULTS	Following capsaicin challenge the greatest average reduction in area of flare was seen for the @ % formulation .
RESULTS	This dose was selected for further investigation .
RESULTS	Itch intensity induced by two challenge agents ( cowhage and histamine ) was assessed on the Computerised Visual Analogue Scale .
RESULTS	The difference in average itch intensity ( Weighted Mean Over @ Mins ) between the @ % dose of SB@ and placebo for the cowhage challenge was -@ , whilst the histamine challenge showed on average a -@ point change .
CONCLUSIONS	The @ % topical formulation of SB@ cream was clinically well tolerated and had target specific pharmacodynamic activity .
CONCLUSIONS	However there were no clinically significant differences on pruritus induced by either challenge agent in comparison to placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	SB@ is unlikely to be of symptomatic benefit for histaminergic or non-histaminergic induced itch .

BACKGROUND	Patients with antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy ( AP/AT ) represent a substantial proportion of ear , nose and throat ( ENT ) patients .
BACKGROUND	Despite the ubiquitous consideration of bleeding and ischemic/thrombembolic risk , no detailed assessment of the perioperative setting in an ENT cohort is available in the literature .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of the present work is to give a detailed assessment of patients with AP/AT in an ENT cohort resulting in ENT-specific recommendations for daily routine .
METHODS	In all , @ randomized patients were asked regarding analgetic therapy in acute pain .
METHODS	Medical data of @patients who underwent head and neck surgery were analyzed for AP/AT therapy .
METHODS	Therapeutic strategies , the perioperative AP/AT therapy , duration of intensive care treatment and hospitalization ( ICT/H ) , application of erythrocytes and internistic/neurolocigal complication data were analyzed in patients with/without AP/AT .
RESULTS	Nearly @ % of our patients were taking AP/AT due to coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , cardiac arrhythmia , or cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
RESULTS	Patients ' questionnaire revealed that @ % of our patients use acetylsalicylic acid in acute pain , which represents @ % of the overall AP/AT cohort .
RESULTS	Head and neck surgery in patients with AP/AT showed an elevated bleeding frequency ( p = @ ) without an elevated risk for internistic/neurological complications .
RESULTS	ICT/H were remarkably prolonged ( p = @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Head and neck surgery in patients with AP/AT can be routinely performed .
CONCLUSIONS	Indication for intensive care , endotracheal intubation , and tracheostomy should be made generously due to high requirements of airway management in ENT .
CONCLUSIONS	Ischemic/thrombembolic and bleeding risk requires careful assessment in an interdisciplinary setting .

BACKGROUND	The mechanism of reflux protection may involve a ` flap valve ' at the oesophago-gastric junction ( OGJ ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of baclofen , a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type-B ( GABA-B ) agonist known to suppress reflux events , on the ` functional anatomy ' of the OGJ and proximal stomach after a large test meal .
METHODS	Twelve healthy volunteers ( HVs ) and @ patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) ; with erosive oesophagitis or pathological oesophageal acid exposure completed a randomised , double-blind , cross-over study .
METHODS	On @ test days participants received @-mg baclofen or placebo before ingestion of a large test meal .
METHODS	OGJ structure and function were assessed by high-resolution manometry ( HRM ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) using validated methods .
METHODS	Measurements of the oesophago-gastric angle were derived from three-dimensional models reconstructed from anatomic MRI images .
METHODS	Cine-MRI and HRM identified postprandial reflux events .
METHODS	Mixed model analysis and Wilcoxon rank signed tests assessed differences between participant groups and treatment conditions .
RESULTS	In both HVs and GERD patients , baclofen reduced the frequency of postprandial reflux events .
RESULTS	The oesophago-gastric insertion angle in GERD patients was reduced ( -@ @ , P = @ ) , but was unchanged in healthy controls .
RESULTS	In both study groups , baclofen augmented lower oesophageal sphincter ( LES ) pressure ( HVs : +@ @ mmHg , P < @ , GERD : +@ @ mmHg , P < @ ) and increased LES length ( HVs : +@ @ cm , P < @ , GERD : +@ @ cm , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Baclofen inhibits transient LES relaxations and augments LES pressure and length .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , baclofen has effects on the ` functional anatomy ' of the OGJ and proximal stomach in GERD patients , which may suppress reflux by means of a ` flap valve ' mechanism .

BACKGROUND	The aim of the current study is to compare the accuracy of the ultrasound ( US ) versus clinical assessment for determination of the spinal level , using X-ray as the Gold Standard for control .
METHODS	@ patients were randomized into two equal groups .
METHODS	Patients in the Clinical Group were examined by landmarks to assess the Assumed Clinical Tuffier 's Line , and then by fluoroscopy to determine the True Clinical Tuffier 's Line .
METHODS	Patients in the Ultrasound Group were examined by the ultrasound to determine the Ultrasound Tuffier 's Line .
METHODS	The results of both groups were compared in relation to the plain X-ray , done for each patient , which determined the Radiological Tuffier 's Line .
RESULTS	In the Clinical Group , the True Clinical Tuffier 's line met the Assumed Tuffier 's line in only @ % of the patients .
RESULTS	In the remaining patients , wrong leveling ranged from one space above in @ % to @ spaces above in @ % and in @ % of patients the line was at L@ .
RESULTS	In the Ultrasound Group , wrong leveling occurred in @ % of patients .
RESULTS	The Ultrasound misidentification was less than one level in @ % and one level in @ % of patients .
RESULTS	Ultrasound examination had a true limitation of @ % of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Ultrasound examination of the spine is recommended in patients planned for spinal anesthesia , as it is superior to clinical assessment in identification of the interspinous levels .
CONCLUSIONS	This will decrease the hazard of spinal cord trauma .

BACKGROUND	A constructive safety culture is essential for the successful implementation of patient safety improvements .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of two patient safety culture interventions on incident reporting as a proxy of safety culture .
METHODS	A three-arm cluster randomised trial was conducted in a mixed method study , studying the effect of administering a patient safety culture questionnaire ( intervention I ) , the questionnaire complemented with a practice-based workshop ( intervention II ) and no intervention ( control ) in @ general practices in the Netherlands .
METHODS	The primary outcome , the number of reported incidents , was measured with a questionnaire at baseline and a year after .
METHODS	Analysis was performed using a negative binomial model .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were quality and safety indicators and safety culture .
METHODS	Mixed effects linear regression was used to analyse the culture questionnaires .
RESULTS	The number of incidents increased in both intervention groups , to @ and @ in intervention I and II respectively .
RESULTS	Adjusted for baseline number of incidents , practice size and accreditation status , the study showed that practices that additionally participated in the workshop reported @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ to @ ) times more incidents compared to the control group .
RESULTS	Practices that only completed the questionnaire reported @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ ) times more incidents .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in staff perception of patient safety culture at follow-up between the three study groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Educating staff and facilitating discussion about patient safety culture in their own practice leads to increased reporting of incidents .
CONCLUSIONS	It is beneficial to invest in a team-wise effort to improve patient safety .

OBJECTIVE	The study compared the transurethral resection in saline ( TURis ) , transurethral vaporization in saline ( TUVis ) , bipolar plasma enucleation of the prostate ( BPEP ) , and open prostatectomy ( OP ) in a single-center , prospective , randomized controlled clinical setting exclusively involving large prostate patients .
METHODS	During a @ year enrollment period , @ cases of prostate volume over @mL , maximum flow rate ( Qmax ) below @mL/second , International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) over @ , or urinary retention were included in the trial and equally randomized in the four study arms .
METHODS	Patients were assessed preoperatively as well as at the @ - , @ - , @ - , and @-month follow-up checkups using the IPSS , quality of life ( QoL ) score , Qmax , postvoiding residual urinary volume ( PVR ) , and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) .
RESULTS	Similar preoperative parameters were established in the four series .
RESULTS	OP and BPEP were characterized by resembling operating times , while TURis and TUVis displayed prolonged surgical durations .
RESULTS	TURis emphasized a substantially decreased mean resected tissue weight .
RESULTS	TUVis showed the lowest mean hemoglobin level drop , followed by TURis and BPEP ( equivalent results ) and finally OP ( highest bleeding ) .
RESULTS	OP described the longest mean catheterization period and hospital stay , followed by TURis , and afterward by TUVis and BPEP ( similar data ) .
RESULTS	During the follow-up period , statistically equivalent IPSS , QoL , Qmax , and PVR outcomes were established for OP , BPEP , and TURis .
RESULTS	TUVis displayed significantly smaller Qmax improvements , but similar other functional features .
RESULTS	Significantly lower mean PSA levels were determined secondary to OP and BPEP when compared to bipolar resection and subsequently to vaporization .
CONCLUSIONS	OP and BPEP emphasized the highest surgical efficiency ( prolonged postoperative recovery for OP ) , while TUVis displayed the lowest hemorrhagic risks .
CONCLUSIONS	On the medium term , generally resembling functional outcomes were determined for the four techniques , with significantly decreased mean PSA values secondary to OP and BPEP .

OBJECTIVE	To analyze discordance between global estimates by patients ( PATGL ) and their physicians ( DOCGL ) according to demographic and self-report variables on a Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire ( MDHAQ ) in patients with many rheumatic diseases seen in usual care .
METHODS	Each patient completed an MDHAQ at each visit , which includes scores for physical function , pain , and PATGL , each found on the traditional Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , and scores for sleep quality , anxiety , depression , self-report joint count , and fatigue , which are not found on the HAQ .
METHODS	A random visit of @ patients with any rheumatic diagnosis was analyzed in @ categories : PATGL = DOCGL ( within @ of @ units ) , PATGL > DOCGL ( by @ of @ units ) , and DOCGL > PATGL ( by @ of @ units ) , using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression models .
RESULTS	Patients included @ with rheumatoid arthritis , @ with systemic lupus erythematosus , @ with osteoarthritis , @ with other inflammatory diseases , and @ with other noninflammatory diseases .
RESULTS	Overall , PATGL = DOCGL in @ ( @ % ) , PATGL > DOCGL in @ ( @ % ) , and DOCGL > PATGL in @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	PATGL > DOCGL was associated significantly with older age , female sex , low formal education , Hispanic ethnicity , not working , high MDHAQ physical function and pain scores , and high scores for fatigue , poor sleep , anxiety , depression , and self-report joint count , which are not available on the HAQ .
RESULTS	Pain and fatigue were significant in a final multinomial logistic regression ; the other variables may raise awareness of discordance to clinicians .
CONCLUSIONS	Global estimates of patients indicated significantly poorer status than estimates of their physicians in @ % of @ patients with rheumatic conditions , and were associated with demographic and MDHAQ scores , @ of which are not available on the HAQ .

BACKGROUND	Unhealthy weight loss practices are common among female college students .
BACKGROUND	It is unknown if these practices are also most common among women in the subset of overweight or obese college students or if these practices are related to depression .
BACKGROUND	We examined the relationship between gender , depression , and unhealthy weight loss practices among overweight or obese college students .
METHODS	Students ( body mass index between @ and @ kg/m ( @ ) ) from three Southern California universities ( M ( age ) = @ years , SD = @ ; @ % women ) were recruited from May @ to May @ for participation in a weight loss clinical trial ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Logistic regressions were performed with baseline data to assess the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported unhealthy weight loss practices and gender and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression short form .
RESULTS	Twenty-nine percent of participants reported engaging in at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior ( e.g. , fasting , purging ) over the last @ days , with no differences by gender .
RESULTS	Self-report of at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior was associated with report of symptoms of depression ( e ( B ) = @ -LSB- confidence interval , CI : @-@ @ -RSB- ) , adjusting for potential confounders .
RESULTS	Interactions between gender and depression were not significant ( e ( B ) = @ -LSB- CI : @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among an overweight or obese sample of college students , unhealthy weight loss practices were equally common in both genders , and students with depressive symptomatology were at greatest risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Obesity interventions targeting overweight or obese college students should educate both men and women about the dangers of unhealthy weight loss practices .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , screening for depression can help identify students who would benefit from additional supportive and coping strategies and resources .

BACKGROUND	Provision of mother 's own milk is the optimal way to feed infants , including very low birth weight infants ( VLBW , < @ g ) .
BACKGROUND	Importantly for VLBW infants , who are at elevated risk of neurologic sequelae , mother 's own milk has been shown to enhance neurocognitive development .
BACKGROUND	Unfortunately , the majority of mothers of VLBW infants are unable to provide an adequate supply of milk and thus supplementation with formula or donor milk is necessary .
BACKGROUND	Given the association between mother 's own milk and neurodevelopment , it is important to ascertain whether provision of human donor milk as a supplement may yield superior neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to formula.Our primary hypothesis is that VLBW infants fed pasteurized donor milk compared to preterm formula as a supplement to mother 's own milk for @ days or until hospital discharge , whichever comes first , will have an improved cognitive outcome as measured at @ months corrected age on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development , @ ( rd ) ed .
BACKGROUND	Secondary hypotheses are that the use of pasteurized donor milk will : ( @ ) reduce a composite of death and serious morbidity ; ( @ ) support growth ; and ( @ ) improve language and motor development .
BACKGROUND	Exploratory research questions include : Will use of pasteurized donor milk : ( @ ) influence feeding tolerance and nutrient intake ( @ ) have an acceptable cost effectiveness from a comprehensive societal perspective ?
METHODS	DoMINO is a multi-centre , intent-to-treat , double blinded , randomized control trial .
METHODS	VLBW infants ( n = @ ) were randomized within four days of birth to either ( @ ) pasteurized donor milk or ( @ ) preterm formula whenever mother 's own milk was unavailable .
METHODS	Study recruitment began in October @ and was completed in December @ .
METHODS	The @ day feeding intervention is complete and long-term follow-up is underway .
CONCLUSIONS	Preterm birth and its complications are a leading cause long-term morbidity among Canadian children .
CONCLUSIONS	Strategies to mitigate this risk are urgently required .
CONCLUSIONS	As mother 's own milk has been shown to improve neurodevelopment , it is essential to ascertain whether pasteurized donor milk will confer the same advantage over formula without undue risks and at acceptable costs .
CONCLUSIONS	Knowledge translation from this trial will be pivotal in setting donor milk policy in Canada and beyond .

OBJECTIVE	To analyse late morbidity and mortality in pre and post-menopausal breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy , with emphasis on side-effects from the heart , cerebrovascular and respiratory systems .
METHODS	Long term follow-up of two randomised , clinical trials with @ patients was carried out .
METHODS	Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy ( RT ) , RT + oral cyclophosphamide ( RT+C ) or cyclophosphamide only ( C ) .
METHODS	Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT , RT+T amoxifen for one year ( RT+T am ) or tamoxifen only ( Tam ) .
METHODS	Information on admission to hospital , mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers .
RESULTS	After @ years , adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to @ % ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In post-menopausal women , adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from @ % to @ % ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from @ % to @ % by adding RT to Tam ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up .
RESULTS	In spite of differences in specific causes of death , there were no significant differences between the treatment arms concerning morbidity or overall mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Postmastectomy radiotherapy to the chest wall and loco-regional lymph nodes including the parasternal lymph nodes as delivered in the end of the seventies did not reduce overall mortality , but gave a significantly increased risk of death from heart and cerebrovascular disease , which appeared during the second decade after radiotherapy .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study was to quantify perfusion to the femoral head and head-neck junction using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging following three surgical dislocations of the hip ( trochanteric flip osteotomy , standard posterior approach , and modified posterior approach ) .
METHODS	The medial femoral circumflex artery was cannulated in fifty fresh-frozen cadaveric hips ( twenty-five pelvic specimens ) .
METHODS	One hip on each pelvic specimen was randomly chosen to undergo one of the three surgical dislocations , and the contralateral hip was used as a control .
METHODS	Gadolinium enhancement on the magnetic resonance imaging scan was quantified in both the femoral head and head-neck junction by volumetric analysis using custom magnetic resonance imaging analysis software .
METHODS	A polyurethane compound was then injected , and gross dissection was performed to assess the extraosseous vasculature .
RESULTS	Magnetic resonance imaging quantification revealed that the trochanteric flip osteotomy group maintained almost full perfusion ( mean , @ % for the femoral head and @ % for the head-neck junction ) .
RESULTS	The standard posterior approach almost completely compromised perfusion ( mean , @ % for the femoral head and @ % for the head-neck junction ) .
RESULTS	Six specimens in the modified posterior approach group demonstrated partial perfusion ( mean , @ % in the femoral head and @ % in the head-neck junction ) .
RESULTS	Three specimens in the modified posterior approach group demonstrated almost full perfusion ( mean , @ % in the femoral head and @ % in the head-neck junction ) .
RESULTS	Gross dissection revealed that all specimens in the standard posterior approach group and seven of ten in the modified posterior approach group sustained disruption of the ascending branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery .
RESULTS	All specimens in the standard posterior approach group demonstrated disruption of the inferior retinacular artery .
RESULTS	The inferior retinacular artery remained intact in nine of ten specimens in the modified posterior approach group .
RESULTS	One specimen in the modified posterior approach group that had disruption of both the ascending medial femoral circumflex artery and inferior retinacular artery demonstrated a substantial decrease in perfusion ( @ % in the femoral head and @ % in the head-neck junction ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The trochanteric flip osteotomy preserves the vascular supply to the femoral head and head-neck junction .
CONCLUSIONS	The standard posterior approach disrupts the vascular supply and should be completely abandoned for surgical hip dislocation .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite reduced enhancement , substantial perfusion of the femoral head and head-neck junction was present in the modified posterior approach group , likely because of the preservation of the inferior retinacular artery .
CONCLUSIONS	The modified posterior approach produced variable results , indicating that improvement to the modified posterior approach is needed .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study provides previously unreported quantitative magnetic resonance imaging data on the perfusion to the femoral head and head-neck junction during common surgical approaches to the hip .

BACKGROUND	Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) is already being used in certain clinical and research settings , but its impact on patient well-being , health-care utilization , and clinical decision-making remains largely unstudied .
BACKGROUND	It is also unknown how best to communicate sequencing results to physicians and patients to improve health .
BACKGROUND	We describe the design of the MedSeq Project : the first randomized trials of WGS in clinical care .
METHODS	This pair of randomized controlled trials compares WGS to standard of care in two clinical contexts : ( a ) disease-specific genomic medicine in a cardiomyopathy clinic and ( b ) general genomic medicine in primary care .
METHODS	We are recruiting @ to @ cardiologists , @ to @ primary care physicians , and approximately @ of their patients .
METHODS	Patient participants in both the cardiology and primary care trials are randomly assigned to receive a family history assessment with or without WGS .
METHODS	Our laboratory delivers a genome report to physician participants that balances the needs to enhance understandability of genomic information and to convey its complexity .
METHODS	We provide an educational curriculum for physician participants and offer them a hotline to genetics professionals for guidance in interpreting and managing their patients ' genome reports .
METHODS	Using varied data sources , including surveys , semi-structured interviews , and review of clinical data , we measure the attitudes , behaviors and outcomes of physician and patient participants at multiple time points before and after the disclosure of these results .
CONCLUSIONS	The impact of emerging sequencing technologies on patient care is unclear .
CONCLUSIONS	We have designed a process of interpreting WGS results and delivering them to physicians in a way that anticipates how we envision genomic medicine will evolve in the near future .
CONCLUSIONS	That is , our WGS report provides clinically relevant information while communicating the complexity and uncertainty of WGS results to physicians and , through physicians , to their patients .
CONCLUSIONS	This project will not only illuminate the impact of integrating genomic medicine into the clinical care of patients but also inform the design of future studies .

BACKGROUND	It is unknown whether leptin and peptide YY ( PYY ) influence changes in resting energy expenditure ( REE ) , independently of fat mass ( FM ) and fat-free mass ( FFM ) in addition to changes in other energy expenditure ( EE ) components during weight loss .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to examine the relationships between leptin , PYY , and body composition with different EE components before and after weight loss and whether changes in leptin and PYY were associated with differences in predicted vs measured REE after the intervention .
METHODS	This was a randomized controlled design .
METHODS	The study was conducted in a laboratory .
METHODS	Participants were ninety-three overweight/obese postmenopausal women ( aged @ @ y ; body mass index @ @ kg/m ( @ ) ) .
METHODS	Interventions included a @-month caloric restriction diet alone or caloric restriction diet + resistance training .
METHODS	Body composition ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , REE ( indirect calorimetry ) , total EE ( TEE ; doubly labeled water ) , and fasting leptin and total PYY before and after weight loss were measured .
RESULTS	Both interventions yielded significant decreases in weight , FFM , REE , and leptin , whereas a significant time group interaction was noted for FM ( greater decrease in FM in the diet + resistance training group ) ( P < @ for all outcomes ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences in TEE , physical activity EE , and PYY were noted between baseline and after the intervention .
RESULTS	Age , FFM , leptin , and PYY were the best predictors of baseline REE ( R ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) , whereas age , FFM , and FM were associated with REE after the intervention ( R ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The same predictors , except for leptin , were significantly related to TEE at baseline ( R ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) and after the intervention ( R ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) , whereas only PYY was a significant predictor of physical activity EE at baseline and after the intervention .
RESULTS	Changes in FM and leptin accounted for @ % of the variance in REE ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Greater predicted vs measured REE was noted after the intervention ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , leptin and PYY were not significant predictors of the differences between postintervention measurement and predicted REE .
CONCLUSIONS	Leptin and FM were strong contributors to changes in REE .
CONCLUSIONS	However , leptin and PYY were not significant predictors of the differences between predicted and measured REE after the intervention .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the influence of epidural analgesia and lumbar paravertebral block on the structure of the delivery , the fetus and newborn , and the quality and duration of analgesia .
METHODS	Patients were randomized into three groups , @ patients in each group .
METHODS	In the group-@ patients received epidural analgesia ( EA ) , in the group-@ -- paravertebral block ( PVB ) , in the group-@ patients refused pain relief in labor .
METHODS	Pain was assessed by VAS .
METHODS	Length of the first and second stage of labor the impact on the CTG and fetal blood gases from the umbilical cord of newborns in the first minute of life were fixed .
METHODS	Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and presented as median ( @th-@th percentiles ) .
RESULTS	In both groups of patients in pain reduction was significant adjustment contractions and after @ hour was @ % in EA , and PVB group -- @ % of the initial values .
RESULTS	Under EA opening cervix was statistically significantly greater than in the PVB ( @ ( @ , @ ) vs @ ( @ , @ ) min ) p < @ .
RESULTS	Second stage of labor was also shorter in the PVB than in the EA ( @ ( @ , @ ) vs @ ( @ , @ ) min ) , in the control group it was -- @ ( @ , @ ) min , p < @ .
RESULTS	PVB was observed in the group of more stable hemodynamics than in the EA for the entire period of observation .
RESULTS	There were no adverse effects on the fetus and the newborn in the arms of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	The proposed lumbar paravertebral block is simple to perform , is effective in reducing pain in the first stage of labor does not require continuous hemodynamic monitoring may be used for the treatment of birth dystocia and is a good alternative when the use of epidural analgesia during labor is limited .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effect on maternal weight gain of a supervised light - to moderate-intensity exercise-based intervention performed from the ninth week of pregnancy .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy pregnant women were randomly assigned to a standard care or exercise intervention group conducted between September @ , @ , and January @ , @ .
METHODS	The intervention included light - to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercises performed @ days a week ( @-@ minutes per session ) .
METHODS	Excessive gestational weight gain was calculated on the basis of the @ Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) recommendations .
METHODS	Gestational body weight gain was calculated on the basis of the weight measured at the first prenatal visit ( fifth to sixth weeks of gestation ) and weight measured at the last visit to the clinic before delivery .
METHODS	Women were categorized into normal weight or overweight or obese .
RESULTS	Women in the intervention group gained less weight ( adjusted mean difference , @ kg ; @ % CI , @-@ @ kg ; P < @ ) and were less likely to gain weight above the IOM recommendations ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) compared with those in the standard care group .
RESULTS	The main treatment effects according to body mass index category were that normal weight women in the intervention group gained less weight ( adjusted mean difference , @ kg ; @ % CI , @-@ @ kg ; P < @ ) and were less likely to gain weight above the IOM recommendations ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) than normal weight women who received standard care .
RESULTS	No significant treatment effect was observed in overweight or obese women .
CONCLUSIONS	Supervised exercise of light to moderate intensity can be used to prevent excessive gestational weight gain , especially in normal weight women .

BACKGROUND	Improving the health of school-aged children can yield substantial benefits for cognitive development and educational achievement .
BACKGROUND	However , there is limited experimental evidence of the benefits of alternative school-based malaria interventions or how the impacts of interventions vary according to intensity of malaria transmission .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the effect of intermittent screening and treatment ( IST ) for malaria on the health and education of school children in an area of low to moderate malaria transmission .
RESULTS	A cluster randomised trial was implemented with @,@ children in @ government primary schools on the south coast of Kenya in @-@ .
RESULTS	The intervention was delivered to children randomly selected from classes @ and @ who were followed up for @ months .
RESULTS	Once a school term , children were screened by public health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) , and children ( with or without malaria symptoms ) found to be RDT-positive were treated with a six dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) .
RESULTS	Given the nature of the intervention , the trial was not blinded .
RESULTS	The primary outcomes were anaemia and sustained attention .
RESULTS	Secondary outcomes were malaria parasitaemia and educational achievement .
RESULTS	Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis .
RESULTS	During the intervention period , an average of @ % children in intervention schools were screened at each round , of whom @ % were RDT-positive .
RESULTS	@ % of children in the control and @ % in the intervention group were followed-up at @ months .
RESULTS	No impact of the malaria IST intervention was observed for prevalence of anaemia at either @ or @ months ( adjusted risk ratio -LSB- Adj.RR -RSB- : @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ and Adj.RR : @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) respectively , or on prevalence of P. falciparum infection or scores of classroom attention .
RESULTS	No effect of IST was observed on educational achievement in the older class , but an apparent negative effect was seen on spelling scores in the younger class at @ and @ months and on arithmetic scores at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	In this setting in Kenya , IST as implemented in this study is not effective in improving the health or education of school children .
CONCLUSIONS	Possible reasons for the absence of an impact are the marked geographical heterogeneity in transmission , the rapid rate of reinfection following AL treatment , the variable reliability of RDTs , and the relative contribution of malaria to the aetiology of anaemia in this setting .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of a hydrocolloid dressing containing ceramide for hand-foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) on the soles of the feet in metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patients treated with sorafenib .
METHODS	Patients with grade @ HFSR on the soles of the feet were randomly assigned in to two groups .
METHODS	One group received a hydrocolloid dressing containing ceramide ( arm A ) and the other received @ % urea cream ( arm B ) .
METHODS	Patients in both groups applied treatment to the affected sites on the soles of the feet , but not to the hands .
METHODS	The primary end point was the incidence of grade @ or @ HFSR on the soles of the feet in the first @ weeks .
RESULTS	Thirty-three patients were assessed ( @ in arm A and @ in arm B ) , and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups .
RESULTS	During the observation period of this study , grade @ or @ HFSR on the soles of the feet was found in @ % of patients in arm A and was significantly less than the @ % in arm B ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of HFSR on the hands , however , was similar in both arms .
RESULTS	The median time to grade @ or @ HFSR on the soles of the feet was also significantly longer in arm A than in arm B ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that a hydrocolloid dressing containing ceramide prevented the worsening of HFSR caused by sorafenib in metastatic RCC patients .

BACKGROUND	Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) leads to a profound muscular atrophy , bone loss and bone fragility .
BACKGROUND	While there is evidence that exercising paralysed muscles may lead to reversal of muscle atrophy in the chronic period after SCI , there is little evidence that exercise can prevent muscle changes early after injury .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , whether exercise can prevent bone loss and microarchitectural decay is not clear .
METHODS	A multi-centre , parallel group , assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted .
METHODS	Fifty participants with acute spinal cord injury will be recruited from four SCI units in Australia and New Zealand .
METHODS	Participants will be stratified by site and AIS status and randomised to an experimental or control group .
METHODS	Experimental participants will receive a @-week programme of functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) - assisted cycling .
METHODS	Control participants will receive a @-week programme of passive cycling .
METHODS	The primary outcome is muscle cross-sectional area of the thigh and calf measured using magnetic resonance images ( MRI ) of the leg .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include serum biomarkers of SCI osteoporosis ( sclerostin , P@NP and - CTX ) , markers of immune function ( IL-@ , IL-@ , FGF@ , INF - , TNF - ) , neurological function , body composition , depression and quality of life .
METHODS	Leg MRIs will be measured by a single blinded assessor based in Melbourne .
METHODS	Serum samples will be analysed in a central laboratory .
METHODS	All other characteristics will be measured at baseline and @weeks by blinded and trained assessors at each site .
METHODS	The first participant was randomised on @ November @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this trial will determine the relative effectiveness of a @-week programme of FES-assisted cycling versus passive cycling in preventing muscle atrophy and maintaining skeletal integrity after spinal cord injury .

BACKGROUND	Hospitalization for acute heart failure ( HF ) is associated with high rates of subsequent mortality and readmission .
BACKGROUND	We assessed the influence of the time interval between previous HF hospitalization and randomization in the Candesartan in Heart failure : Reduction in Mortality and morbidity ( CHARM ) trials on clinical outcomes in patients with both reduced and preserved ejection fraction .
RESULTS	CHARM enrolled @ patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV HF , of whom @ had a history of previous HF hospitalization .
RESULTS	Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between time from previous HF hospitalization and randomization and the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or unplanned admission to hospital for the management of worsening HF during a median of @ months .
RESULTS	For patients with HF and reduced or preserved ejection fraction , rates of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization were higher among patients with previous HF hospitalization than those without .
RESULTS	The risk for mortality and hospitalization varied inversely with the time interval between hospitalization and randomization .
RESULTS	Rates were higher for patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction within each category .
RESULTS	Event rates for those with HF with preserved ejection fraction and a HF hospitalization in the @ months before randomization were comparable with the rate in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction with no previous HF hospitalization .
CONCLUSIONS	Rates of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization are greatest in those who have been previously hospitalized for HF .
CONCLUSIONS	Independent of EF , rates of death and readmission decline as time from HF hospitalization to trial enrollment increased .
CONCLUSIONS	Recent HF hospitalization identifies a high-risk population for future clinical trials in HF and reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction .

OBJECTIVE	To study whether Johan Sebastian Bach music has a lowering effect on resting energy expenditure ( REE ) similar to that of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart music .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized clinical trial with cross-over in @ healthy , appropriate weights for gestational age ( GA ) , gavage fed , metabolically stable , preterm infants .
METHODS	Infants were randomized to a @-min period of either Mozart or Bach music or no music over @ consecutive days .
METHODS	REE was measured every minute by indirect calorimetry .
RESULTS	Three REE measurements were performed in each of @ infants at age @ days .
RESULTS	Mean GA was @ weeks and mean birthweight was @g .
RESULTS	REE was similar during the first @-min of all three randomization periods .
RESULTS	During the next @-min period , infants exposed to music by Mozart had a trend toward lower REE than when not exposed to music .
RESULTS	This trend became significant during the third @-min period .
RESULTS	In contrast , music by Bach or no music did not affect significantly REE during the whole study .
RESULTS	On average , the effect size of Mozart music upon REE was a reduction of @ % from baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Mozart music significantly lowers REE in preterm infants , whereas Bach music has no similar effect .
CONCLUSIONS	We speculate that ` Mozart effect ' must be taken into account when incorporating music in the therapy of preterm infants , as not all types of music may have similar effects upon REE and growth .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether couples with moderate male infertility should be treated with conventional in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) .
METHODS	A total of @ couples with moderate male infertility undergoing their first IVF/ICSI cycle were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	The couples were divided into two groups according to the results of semen analysis : moderate oligozoospermia ( O group ) and moderate oligoasthenozoospermia ( OA group ) .
METHODS	Sibling oocytes were randomized into groups to be inseminated either by conventional IVF or ICSI .
METHODS	Fertilization rate , embryo quality , implantation rate , and clinical pregnancy rate were examined .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the fertilization , implantation , and pregnancy rates between conventional IVF and ICSI in either the O group or OA group ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , in the OA group , the good quality embryo rate was similar after IVF or ICSI ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	However , in the O group , the good quality embryo rate was significantly higher after ICSI than after IVF ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Couples with moderate oligozoospermia or moderate oligoasthenozoospermia did not influence the major indices of IVF .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of the uncertainties concerning the safety of ICSI , couples with moderate oligozoospermia or moderate oligoasthenozoospermia need not be subjected to this procedure .

BACKGROUND	Venous thromboembolism may be the earliest sign of cancer .
BACKGROUND	Currently , there is a great diversity in practices regarding screening for occult cancer in a person who has an unprovoked venous thromboembolism .
BACKGROUND	We sought to assess the efficacy of a screening strategy for occult cancer that included comprehensive computed tomography ( CT ) of the abdomen and pelvis in patients who had a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism .
METHODS	We conducted a multicenter , open-label , randomized , controlled trial in Canada .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo limited occult-cancer screening ( basic blood testing , chest radiography , and screening for breast , cervical , and prostate cancer ) or limited occult-cancer screening in combination with CT. .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was confirmed cancer that was missed by the screening strategy and detected by the end of the @-year follow-up period .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who underwent randomization , @ ( @ % ) had a new diagnosis of occult cancer between randomization and the @-year follow-up : @ of the @ patients ( @ % ) in the limited-screening group and @ of the @ patients ( @ % ) in the limited-screening-plus-CT group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the primary outcome analysis , @ occult cancers ( @ % ) were missed by the limited screening strategy , whereas @ ( @ % ) were missed by the strategy of limited screening plus CT ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two study groups in the mean time to a cancer diagnosis ( @ months in the limited-screening group and @ months in the limited-screening-plus-CT group , P = @ ) or in cancer-related mortality ( @ % and @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The prevalence of occult cancer was low among patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism .
CONCLUSIONS	Routine screening with CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not provide a clinically significant benefit .

BACKGROUND	In guided tissue regenerative surgery , membrane perforations may serve as a mechanism for the passage of cells and biologic mediators from the periosteum and overlying gingival connective tissue into the periodontal defects .
BACKGROUND	To test this assumption , this study was designed to evaluate levels of bone morphogenetic protein-@ ( BMP-@ ) in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) during the early stages of healing for sites treated with modified perforated membranes ( MPMs ) as compared with occlusive membranes ( OMs ) .
METHODS	Fifteen non-smoking patients with severe chronic periodontitis participated in this prospective , randomized and single-blinded clinical trial .
METHODS	Each patient contributed two interproximal contralateral defects that were randomly assigned to either an experimental modified perforated membrane group ( @ sites ) or a control occlusive membrane group ( @ sites ) .
METHODS	Plaque index , gingival index , probing depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) and the relative intrabony depth of the defect ( rIBD ) were measured at baseline and reassessed at three , six and nine months after therapy .
METHODS	Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected on day @ and @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ days after therapy .
RESULTS	The MPM-treated group showed a statistically significant improvement in PD reduction and clinical attachment gain compared to the OM control group .
RESULTS	Similarly , rIBD was significantly reduced in MPM-treated sites as compared with those of the OM group .
RESULTS	BMP-@ concentrations peaked in the MPM samples obtained during the early postoperative period ( days @ , @ and @ ) with a statistically significant difference compared with OM-treated groups .
RESULTS	BMP-@ levels decreased sharply in the samples obtained at days @ , @ and @ with non-significant higher levels in MPM samples as compared with those of OM sites .
CONCLUSIONS	Within the limits of the present study , one can conclude that MPM coverage of periodontal defects is associated with a significant initial increase in GCF levels of BMP-@ , a factor that could improve the clinical outcomes of guided tissue regenerative surgery .

OBJECTIVE	The protective effects of volatile anaesthetics against ischaemia-reperfusion injury have been shown in vitro , but clinical studies have yielded variable results .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that , in children , sevoflurane provides superior cardioprotection after cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) compared with totally intravenous anaesthesia ( TIVA ) .
METHODS	In this randomized controlled , single-centre study , @ children with cyanotic and acyanotic heart defects undergoing elective cardiac surgery under CPB ( RACHS-@ @-@ ) were randomized to sevoflurane or TIVA ( midazolam < @ months of age , propofol > @ months of age ) .
METHODS	The primary end-point was the postoperative peak cardiac troponin I/T ( cTnI/T ) .
METHODS	Perioperative cardiac function ( as determined by brain-type natriuretic peptide , echocardiography and postoperative vasopressor/inotrope requirements ) , short-term clinical outcomes ( duration of intubation , intensive care unit and hospital length of stay ) , postoperative inflammatory profile , and pulmonary , renal and liver function were defined as secondary end-points .
METHODS	Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative peak troponin values or any of the secondary end-points .
RESULTS	In the subgroup of acyanotic patients under @ months , sevoflurane led to significantly lower postoperative troponin levels compared with midazolam -LSB- reduction of @ % ( @ % confidence interval @-@ % , P = @ ) -RSB- , without any differences in secondary outcome parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	Sevoflurane did not provide superior myocardial protection in our general paediatric cardiac surgical population .
CONCLUSIONS	In children under @ months , however , sevoflurane might be beneficial in comparison with midazolam .
CONCLUSIONS	The conditioning effects of sevoflurane in specific paediatric subgroups need to be further investigated .

OBJECTIVE	Despite their high prevalence in daily life , repeated night-wakings and their cognitive and emotional consequences have received less research attention compared to other types of sleep disturbances .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to experimentally compare the effects of one night of induced infrequent night-wakings ( of @ min , each requiring a purposeful response ) and sleep restriction on sustained attention and mood in young adults .
METHODS	In a within-between subjects counterbalanced design , @ healthy adults ( @ females ; aged @-@ years ) underwent home assessments of sustained attention and self-reported mood at two times : after a normal ( control ) sleep night , and after a night of either sleep restriction ( @h in bed ) or induced night-wakings ( four prolonged awakenings across @h in bed ) .
METHODS	Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and sleep diaries .
METHODS	Sustained attention was assessed using an online continuous performance test ( OCPT ) , and mood was reported online using the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) .
RESULTS	Actigraphic data revealed good compliance with experimental sleep requirements .
RESULTS	Induced night-wakings and sleep restriction both resulted in more OCPT omission and commission errors , and in increased depression , fatigue and confusion levels and reduced vigor compared to the normal sleep night .
RESULTS	Moreover , there were no significant differences between the consequences of induced awakenings and sleep restriction .
CONCLUSIONS	Our pilot study indicates that , similar to sleep restriction , one night of life-like repeated night-wakings negatively affects mood and sustained attention .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the efficacy of a physical activity behavioral intervention for improving outcomes of body composition in persons with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
METHODS	Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	University research laboratory .
METHODS	Ambulatory persons with MS ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	A @-month , internet-delivered physical activity behavioral intervention designed to increase lifestyle physical activity , primarily walking .
METHODS	The behavioral intervention was based on principles of social cognitive theory .
METHODS	Whole-body bone mineral content ( BMC ) , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and soft tissue composition , using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between conditions posttrial on body composition outcomes using the adjusted critical value ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant effect of the intervention on whole-body BMC ( P = @ , ( @ ) < @ ) and BMD ( P = @ , ( @ ) = @ ) using the unadjusted critical value ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The effect of the intervention on percent body fat ( P = @ , ( @ ) = @ ) and whole-body fat mass ( P = @ , ( @ ) = @ ) approached significance using unadjusted criteria .
RESULTS	There was not a significant effect on whole-body lean soft tissue ( P = @ , ( @ ) < @ ) or body mass index ( P = @ , ( @ ) < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results provide preliminary evidence that an internet-delivered lifestyle physical activity intervention might improve bone health and body composition in MS. Such findings are important considering that physical activity is a modifiable behavior with the potential to confer long-term benefits for the prevention and management of fracture risk and comorbidities among those with MS.

BACKGROUND	After kidney transplantation , immunosuppressive therapy causes impaired cellular immune defense leading to an increased risk of viral complications .
BACKGROUND	Trough level monitoring of immunosuppressants is insufficient to estimate the individual intensity of immunosuppression .
BACKGROUND	We have already shown that virus-specific T cells ( Tvis ) correlate with control of virus replication as well as with the intensity of immunosuppression .
BACKGROUND	The multicentre IVIST@-trial should prove that additional steering of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better graft function by avoidance of over-immunosuppression ( for example , viral infections ) and drug toxicity ( for example , nephrotoxicity ) .
METHODS	The IVIST-trial starts @weeks after transplantation .
METHODS	Sixty-four pediatric kidney recipients are randomized either to a non-intervention group that is only treated conservatively or to an intervention group with additional monitoring by Tvis .
METHODS	The randomization is stratified by centre and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) prophylaxis .
METHODS	In both groups the immunosuppressive medication ( cyclosporine A and everolimus ) is adopted in the same target range of trough levels .
METHODS	In the non-intervention group the immunosuppressive therapy ( cyclosporine A and everolimus ) is only steered by classical trough level monitoring and the antiviral therapy of a CMV infection is performed according to a standard protocol .
METHODS	In contrast , in the intervention group the dose of immunosuppressants is individually adopted according to Tvis levels as a direct measure of the intensity of immunosuppression in addition to classical trough level monitoring .
METHODS	In case of CMV infection or reactivation the antiviral management is based on the individual CMV-specific immune defense assessed by the CMV-Tvis level .
METHODS	Primary endpoint of the study is the glomerular filtration rate @years after transplantation ; secondary endpoints are the number and severity of viral infections and the incidence of side effects of immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs .
CONCLUSIONS	This IVIST@-trial will answer the question whether the new concept of steering immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better future graft function .
CONCLUSIONS	In terms of an effect-related drug monitoring , the study design aims to realize a personalization of immunosuppressive and antiviral management after transplantation .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the IVIST@-trial , immunomonitoring by Tvis might be incorporated into routine care after kidney transplantation .

BACKGROUND	Breathing-retraining and helium-oxygen ( heliox ) have been used to improve exercise tolerance in COPD .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that , in patients with COPD , exercise duration after exercise-training plus breathing-retraining and oxygen would be longer than after exercise-training plus heliox or after exercise-training plus oxygen alone .
BACKGROUND	We also explored the short-term maintenance of gains in exercise duration after using each technique .
METHODS	Of @ COPD patients recruited , @ were randomly assigned to exercise-training plus heliox ( n = @ ) , exercise-training plus breathing-retraining and oxygen ( n = @ ) and exercise-training and oxygen ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	FiO@ was @ during testing and training in all groups .
METHODS	Patients exercised on a treadmill thrice-weekly for eight weeks .
METHODS	Before , at completion of training , and six-weeks later , patients underwent constant-load treadmill testing .
RESULTS	At completion of training , improvements in exercise duration in the heliox and breathing-retraining groups were not significantly different .
RESULTS	Compared to the exercise-training plus oxygen group , exercise duration improved more in the breathing-retraining group ( P = @ ) but not in the heliox group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hyperinflation was reduced with breathing-retraining plus oxygen compared to the other two groups .
RESULTS	Six-weeks later , improvements in exercise duration were still greater with breathing-retraining than with exercise-training ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , improvements in exercise duration with heliox did not differ from those in the other two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In moderate-to-severe COPD , exercise-training combined with either heliox or with breathing-retraining yielded not significantly different improvements in exercise duration - with only the latter being superior to exercise-training .
CONCLUSIONS	Six-weeks after training , these improvements were still greater after exercise-training plus breathing-retraining than after exercise-training .

BACKGROUND	The incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) in cardiac surgery patients is high and this condition contributes to an adverse outcome .
BACKGROUND	Damage-associated molecular pattern ( DAMP ) molecules , HMGB@ and S@A@ , are thought to mediate inflammatory changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to determine whether DAMP are involved in the pathogenesis of TRALI in cardiac surgery patients .
METHODS	This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational trial in cardiac surgery patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a university hospital in the Netherlands .
METHODS	Fourteen TRALI cases were randomly matched with @ transfused and non-transfused controls .
METHODS	Pulmonary levels of HMGB@ , S@A@ and inflammatory cytokines ( interleukins-@ , -@ , and -@ and tumour necrosis factor - ) were determined when TRALI evolved .
METHODS	In addition , systemic and pulmonary levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products ( sRAGE ) were determined .
RESULTS	HMGB@ expression and levels of sRAGE in TRALI patients did not differ from those in controls .
RESULTS	There was a trend towards higher S@A@ levels in TRALI patients compared to the controls .
RESULTS	Furthermore , S@A@ levels were associated with increased levels of markers of pulmonary inflammation , prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass , hypoxemia and duration of mechanical ventilation .
CONCLUSIONS	No evidence was found that HMGB@ and sRAGE contribute to the development of TRALI .
CONCLUSIONS	S@A@ is associated with duration of cardiopulmonary bypass , pulmonary inflammation , hypoxia and prolonged mechanical ventilation and may contribute to acute lung injury in cardiac surgery patients .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of triflusal and its major active metabolite , @-hydroxy-@-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid ( HTB ) , following a single oral dose of @ mg in healthy subjects under fed and fasting conditions .
METHODS	The study participants ( n = @ ) were randomized to receive one @ mg triflusal capsule in a fasting condition ( no food for @ hours ) or a fed condition ( after a high-fat meal ) ; after a @-week washout period , participants received the same dose of triflusal capsule under the converse condition .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin @ software .
METHODS	Safety was evaluated through assessment of adverse events , standard laboratory evaluations , vital signs , and @-lead electrocardiography .
RESULTS	The mean Cmax of triflusal and HTB were @ , @ ug/mL for the fasting state and @ , @ ug/mL for the fed state , respectively .
RESULTS	The AUC@-@ of triflusal and HTB were @ , @,@ hxg/mL for the fasting state and @ , @,@ hxg/mL for the fed state , the AUC@ - of triflusal and HTB were @ , @,@ hxg/mL for the fasting state and @ , @,@ hxg/mL for the fed state , respectively .
RESULTS	The results showed that Cmax and AUCs for triflusal were outside the bioequivalency ( BE ) interval after food intake , but there was no statistically significant change for HTB .
CONCLUSIONS	High-fat food intake may affect the pharmacokinetics of triflusal capsule in healthy subjects .

OBJECTIVE	This research compared the effects of real versus hyper-real images on anxiety , disgust , and physiological arousal during internet-delivered exposure in high spider-fearfuls .
OBJECTIVE	Hyper-real images were digitally altered to highlight fearful aspects .
OBJECTIVE	A further aim was to examine self-reported and behavioural therapeutic outcomes and exposure-related predictors of these outcomes .
METHODS	Twenty-eight females were randomised to real ( n = @ ) or hyper-real ( n = @ ) treatment groups and nine participants were subsequently allocated to a wait-list control group .
METHODS	Treatment groups viewed an @-stage exposure hierarchy of real or hyper-real spider images .
METHODS	Subjective anxiety and disgust ratings were taken during each stage ( @ , @ , @ , @s ) with heart rate and skin conductance recorded throughout .
RESULTS	Anxiety , disgust and physiological arousal habituated within each exposure stage , with no differential effect of real compared to hyper-real images .
RESULTS	Both treatment groups but not controls demonstrated significant reductions in behavioural avoidance and self-reported phobic symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment with large effect sizes noted .
RESULTS	The change in within-stage habituation of anxiety , disgust and heart rate , between the first and last stage , predicted improvement in behavioural avoidance at post-treatment .
RESULTS	This suggests that generalisation of habituation to multiple images is an important predictor of improvement .
CONCLUSIONS	While findings in relation to therapeutic outcome should be considered preliminary , clear relationships were found between exposure-related variables and outcome among those who undertook treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings provide evidence in support of the efficacy of online image-based exposure and have implications for informing further research into the underlying mechanisms of image-based exposure treatment .

OBJECTIVE	Recently , obesity patients have been diagnosed as metabolic syndrome .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate which angiotensin type @ receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , telmisartan or candesartan , is superior for the control of home blood pressure ( BP ) in the morning when the outpatient clinic BP was well controlled in the patients with metabolic syndrome .
METHODS	The patients with metabolic syndrome were enrolled .
METHODS	Home BP was monitored by using a telemedicine system .
METHODS	After a @ - to @-week control period to establish baseline home BP values , these patients were randomly divided into telmisartan ( @-@ mg ) and candesartan ( @-@ mg ) groups .
METHODS	These end points were evaluated by using the telemedicine system during steady-state active therapy .
METHODS	A total of @ patients attending @ outpatient Japanese centers were recruited .
RESULTS	On a day of active therapy , telmisartan significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic home BP in the morning to a greater extent compared to candesartan .
RESULTS	At the end of the study , reductions in systolic and diastolic home BP in the morning , in telmisartan group were significantly larger compared to the changes in the candesartan group ( systolic ; Tel : @ @ versus Can : @ @ mmHg , p = @ , diastolic ; Tel : @ @ versus Can : @ @ mmHg , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally in the telmisartan treated group , LDL-cholesterol showed significant reduction ( p = @ ) , but candesartan did not .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study by using the telemedicine system clearly demonstrated that telmisartan has a strong effect on reducing morning home BP , and a good effect on lipid metabolism in patients with metabolic syndrome .

OBJECTIVE	Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer become long-term survivors , but are at risk for medical late-effects that can affect their long-term health .
OBJECTIVE	Mailed surveys are well suited to study late-effects in this population , but low response rates can compromise survey validity .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigated whether an unconditional $ @ gift certificate incentive or Priority Mail delivery increased prostate cancer survivors ' response to mailed surveys .
METHODS	@ participants ( mean age = @ years ) , @-@ years post-diagnosis , were randomized to one of four groups : Incentive ; Priority Mail ; Incentive & Priority Mail ; or Control .
METHODS	After an introductory letter , initial study packets were mailed based on randomization ; @ days later , a second study packet was mailed to all non-responders by First-Class Mail .
RESULTS	The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response rates across groups ( ( @ ) = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Priority Mail ( @ % ; p = @ ) and Incentive & Priority Mail ( @ % ; p = @ ) groups had significantly higher response rates than Controls ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	After the second mailing , the overall response rate increased significantly from @ % to @ % ( p < @ ) ; however , response rates no longer differed across groups ( range , @ % -LSB- Incentive group -RSB- to @ % -LSB- Priority Mail group -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term prostate cancer survivors ' response rates to mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat survey mailing , but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not supported in this population .
CONCLUSIONS	By identifying and applying specialized survey methods , studies targeting survivors of prostate cancer and other geriatric cancers may improve response rates , thus limiting a source of potential bias .

OBJECTIVE	To assess , in a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) and in clinical practice , an association of time to remission and baseline disease activity with both induction of remission and sustained remission in etanercept-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
METHODS	Data from an RCT ( Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate with Radiographic Patient Outcomes -LSB- TEMPO -RSB- ; n = @ ) and an observational registry ( Rheumatoid Arthritis DMARD Intervention and Utilization Study -LSB- RADIUS II -RSB- ; n = @ ) were used to evaluate disease activity ( Clinical Disease Activity Index -LSB- CDAI -RSB- score ) over time in patients initiating etanercept ( monotherapy or with methotrexate ) .
METHODS	CDAI remission ( CDAI@ @ ) and sustained remission ( @ months ) were determined through year @ by treatment group , study , time to remission , and disease severity .
RESULTS	Patients from TEMPO and RADIUS II who received etanercept monotherapy showed similar CDAI remission rates ( @ % and @ % , respectively , at @ years ) .
RESULTS	Among patients who received etanercept with methotrexate , remission rates were @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Remission occurred more rapidly in TEMPO than RADIUS II perhaps from differences in compliance , patient populations , or sequence of combination therapy initiation .
RESULTS	Generally , more patients with lower baseline CDAI scores achieved remission than those with higher scores .
RESULTS	Continued remission appeared more likely in patients achieving remission earlier in the course of their therapy ( @-@ months ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Remission by year @ in etanercept-treated ( with and without methotrexate ) patients with RA occurred in @ % of patients in both an RCT ( TEMPO ) and a clinical practice setting ( RADIUS II ) , and more frequently in those with lower baseline disease severity .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with lower RA disease activity were more likely to reach remission .
CONCLUSIONS	Continued remission may be more likely in patients who achieved remission earlier .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the agreement between tumour volume derived from semiautomated volumetry ( SaV ) and tumor volume defined by spherical volume using longest lesion diameter ( LD ) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) or ellipsoid volume using LD and longest orthogonal diameter ( LOD ) according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria .
METHODS	Twenty patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from the CIOX trial were included .
METHODS	A total of @ target lesions were defined by baseline computed tomography and followed until disease progression .
METHODS	All assessments were performed by a single reader .
METHODS	A variance component model was used to compare the three volume versions .
RESULTS	There was a significant difference between the SaV and RECIST-based tumour volumes .
RESULTS	The same model showed no significant difference between the SaV and WHO-based volumes .
RESULTS	Scatter plots showed that the RECIST-based volumes overestimate lesion volume .
RESULTS	The agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume , evaluated by intraclass correlation , showed nearly perfect agreement .
CONCLUSIONS	Estimating the volume of metastatic lesions using both the LD and LOD ( WHO ) is more accurate than those based on LD only ( RECIST ) , which overestimates lesion volume .
CONCLUSIONS	The good agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume enables a reasonable approximation of three-dimensional tumour burden .
CONCLUSIONS	Tumour response in patients undergoing chemotherapy is assessed using CT images Measurements are based on RECIST ( unidimensional ) - based or WHO ( bidimensional ) - based criteria We calculated tumour volume from bidimensional target lesion measurements This formula provides good tumour volume approximation , based on semiautomated volumetry .

BACKGROUND	In spatial neglect , the functional benefit of rehabilitation methods is subject to debate .
BACKGROUND	A few studies have reported that galvanic vestibular stimulation ( GVS ) is efficacious in spatial neglect .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the present study was to establish whether the effects of GVS persist after the end of stimulation .
METHODS	Four patients with pathological rightward deviation in a bisection task at least three months after right hemisphere stroke .
METHODS	A single-blind , randomized crossover design was used to assess the effects of GVS on performance in line bisection and star cancellation tasks under three different conditions ( cathode-right , cathode-left and sham stimulation ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the performance of either task following GVS ( relative to sham stimulation ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Galvanic vestibular stimulation did not reduce spatial neglect symptoms in any of the stimulation conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are necessary to understand the disparity between our results and those reported in the literature .
CONCLUSIONS	Repeated sessions , a higher current intensity and/or alternating-current stimulation may improve this method before it can be used clinically .

BACKGROUND	Dietary lipids are one of the most effective stimulators of carotenoid absorption , but very limited data exist on the impact of endogenous food sources of lipids to enhance carotenoid absorption .
BACKGROUND	The co-consumption of whole egg with carotenoid-rich foods may increase overall carotenoid absorption via lipid-rich egg yolk .
OBJECTIVE	We designed this study to assess the effects of egg consumption on carotenoid absorption from a carotenoid-rich , raw mixed-vegetable salad .
METHODS	Healthy young men ( n = @ ) consumed the same salad ( all served with @ g canola oil ) with no egg ( control ) , @ g scrambled whole eggs ( @ eggs ) -LSB- low egg ( LE ) -RSB- , and @ g scrambled whole eggs ( @ eggs ) -LSB- high egg ( HE ) -RSB- ( a randomized crossover design ) .
METHODS	Control , LE , and HE meals contained @ mg , @ mg ( @ mg from eggs ) , and @ mg ( @ mg from eggs ) total carotenoids and @ g , @ g ( @ g from eggs ) , and @ g ( @ g from eggs ) total lipids , respectively .
METHODS	Blood was collected hourly for @ h , and the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein ( TRL ) fraction was isolated .
METHODS	Total and individual carotenoid contents , including lutein , zeaxanthin , - carotene , - carotene , and lycopene in TRL were analyzed , and composite areas under the curve ( AUCs ) were calculated .
RESULTS	The total mean ( SE ) carotenoid AUC@-@h in TRL was higher for the HE meal than for LE and control meals -LSB- @ @ ( a ) compared with @ @ ( b ) compared with @ @ ( b ) nmol/L @ h , respectively ( values without a common superscript letter differ ) ; P < @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	The TRL AUC ( @-@h ) of lutein and zeaxanthin increased @-@-fold ( P < @ ) , and the TRL AUC ( @-@h ) of carotenoid not present in eggs , including - carotene , - carotene , and lycopene , increased @-@-fold ( P < @ ) for the HE meal compared with the control meal .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support the claim that co-consuming cooked whole eggs is an effective way to enhance carotenoid absorption from other carotenoid-rich foods such as a raw mixed-vegetable salad .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

RESULTS	One month later , patients in TRA group also showed higher VAS scores than those in TFA group -LSB- CAG alone , @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) , p < @ ; PCI , @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) , p < @ , respectively -RSB- .
RESULTS	By the ROC analysis in TRA group , a level of BMI < @ kg/m@ predicted unacceptable pain with a @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity -LSB- area under curve ( AUC ) : @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , p < @ -RSB- , while a wrist circumference < @ cm predicted unacceptable pain with @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity ( AUC : @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The current study suggests that a radial approach for CAG and PCI in patients with a low BMI and small wrist circumference may cause more access site pain as compared with a femoral approach .

OBJECTIVE	Post-hoc , we hypothesized that over the recruitment period of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial ( CREST ) , increasing experience and improved patient selection with carotid stenting , and to a lesser extent , carotid endarterectomy would contribute to lower periprocedural event rates .
METHODS	Three study periods with approximately the same number of patients were defined to span recruitment .
METHODS	Composite and individual rates of periprocedural stroke , myocardial infarction , and death rate were calculated separately by treatment assignment ( carotid stenting/carotid endarterectomy ) .
METHODS	Temporal changes in unadjusted event rates , and rates after adjustment for temporal changes in patient characteristics , were assessed .
RESULTS	For patients randomized to carotid stenting , there was no significant temporal change in the unadjusted composite rates that declined from @ % in the first period , to @ % in the second , and @ % in the third ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Adjustment for patient characteristics attenuated the rates to @ % , @ % , and @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For carotid endarterectomy-randomized patients , both the composite and the combined stroke and death outcome decreased between periods @ and @ and then increased in period @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The hypothesized temporal reduction of stroke + death events for carotid stenting-treated patients was not observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Further adjustment for changes in patient characteristics between periods , including the addition of asymptomatic patients and a > @ % decrease in proportion of octogenarians enrolled , resulted in practically identical rates .

OBJECTIVE	Evidence linking extreme response style ( ER ) to depressive relapse has been mixed .
OBJECTIVE	One reason might be high levels of extreme responses that are positive in nature ( ER-Ps ) compared with those negative in nature ( ER-Ns ) at posttreatment .
OBJECTIVE	ER-Ps likely consist of both maladaptive `` style '' responses and adaptive `` content '' responses ( i.e. , legitimate denials of dysfunction ) .
OBJECTIVE	The composition of ER-Ps might confound measures of total extreme responding as well as conventional scores on cognitive questionnaires .
OBJECTIVE	In the current study , we assessed ER in a new sample by ( a ) disambiguating ER-Ps that reflect style from those that reflect content and ( b ) assessing the contribution of ER-Ps to the prediction of relapse/recurrence .
METHODS	Responders ( N = @ ) to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy versus medications for moderate to severe depression had an average age of @ years ( SD = @ ) , and they were @ % female , @ % married/cohabitating , and @ % Caucasian .
METHODS	ER variables were calculated using the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale ( DAS ; Weissman , @ ) , with ER-Ps categorized as either content or style responses .
METHODS	ER indices and DAS scores were used to predict symptom return over @ years .
RESULTS	No standard extreme responding variables ( e.g. , an index of total extreme responding ) predicted symptom return , but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence .
RESULTS	Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled .
CONCLUSIONS	ER-Ps , at least on the DAS , appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses , which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies .

BACKGROUND	Recent evidence supports the efficacy of programs that promote improvements in the health practices of workers @ years and older who are at higher risk for chronic diseases than younger workers are .
BACKGROUND	Internet-based programs that promote healthy practices have also shown promise and , therefore , should be especially appropriate for workers aged @ years and older .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the research was to evaluate the effectiveness of HealthyPast@ , a fully automated Web-based health promotion program based on social cognitive theory and aimed specifically at workers @ years and older .
METHODS	The randomized controlled trial was conducted across multiple US offices of a large global information technology company .
METHODS	The sample included @ employees aged @ to @ who were recruited online and randomly assigned to the Web-based HealthyPast@ program or to a wait-list control condition .
METHODS	Self-report measures of diet , physical activity , stress , and tobacco use were collected online before and @ months after the program group was given access to the program .
METHODS	Use data included number of log-ins and number of pages accessed .
METHODS	The primary analysis was multiple linear regression , following intent-to-treat principles with multiple imputation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approach for nonmonotone missing data .
METHODS	Potential moderators from demographic characteristics and program dosage effects were assessed using multiple linear regression models .
METHODS	Additional analyses were conducted on complete ( nonimputed ) cases , excluding program participants who used the program for less than @ minutes .
RESULTS	Retention rates were good for both groups : @ % ( @/@ ) for the program group and @ % ( @/@ ) for the control group .
RESULTS	Program group participants spent a mean of @ minutes in the program ( SD @ ) , logged in a mean of @ times ( SD @ ) , and viewed a mean of @ pages ( SD @ ) .
RESULTS	In the analysis of the imputed dataset , the program group performed significantly better than the control group on diet behavioral change self-efficacy ( estimated adjusted difference -LSB- -RSB- = @ , P = @ ) , planning healthy eating ( = @ , P = @ ) , and mild exercise ( = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Moderator and dosage analyses of the dataset found no significant program effects .
RESULTS	Analyses of the nonimputed dataset comparing program users with controls found additional significant program effects on eating practices ( = @ , P = @ ) , exercise self-efficacy ( = @ , P = @ ) , exercise planning ( = @ , P = @ ) , and aging beliefs ( = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Moderator analysis of this dataset also found significant moderator effects of gender on multiple measures of exercise .
CONCLUSIONS	A Web-based health promotion program showed promise for making a significant contribution to the short-term dietary and exercise practices of older working adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Gender effects suggest that the program effects on exercise are due mainly to improvements among women .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the presence of spinal inflammation with and without sacroiliac ( SI ) joint inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in patients with active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) , and to compare the disease characteristics of these subgroups .
METHODS	ABILITY-@ is a multicenter , randomized , controlled trial of adalimumab versus placebo in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA classified using the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society axial SpA criteria .
METHODS	Baseline MRIs were centrally scored independently by @ readers using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada ( SPARCC ) method for the SI joints and the SPARCC @-discovertebral unit method for the spine .
METHODS	Positive evidence of inflammation on MRI was defined as a SPARCC score of @ for either the SI joints or the spine .
RESULTS	Among patients with baseline SPARCC scores , @ % had an SI joint score of @ and @ % had a spine score of @ .
RESULTS	Forty-nine percent of patients with baseline SI joint scores of < @ , and @ % of those with baseline SI joint scores of @ , had a spine score of @ .
RESULTS	Comparison of baseline disease characteristics by baseline SI joint and spine scores showed that a greater proportion of patients in the subgroup with a baseline SPARCC score of @ for both SI joints and spine were male , and patients with spine and SI joint scores of < @ were younger and had shorter symptom duration .
RESULTS	SPARCC spine scores correlated with baseline symptom duration , and SI joint scores correlated negatively with the baseline Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index , but neither correlated with the baseline Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score , total back pain , the patient 's global assessment of disease activity , the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index , morning stiffness , nocturnal pain , or C-reactive protein level .
CONCLUSIONS	Assessment by experienced readers showed that spinal inflammation on MRI might be observed in half of patients with nonradiographic axial SpA without SI joint inflammation .

BACKGROUND	The outcomes of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( DB-ACLR ) are becoming controversial .
BACKGROUND	One of the main reasons for the controversy is the techniques for bone tunnel placement .
BACKGROUND	The common technique to place the bone tunnels is to use bony landmarks , while a new approach uses footprint remnants .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate if placement of double tunnels using bony landmarks produces the same clinical results as that of using existing footprint remnants .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial ; Level of evidence , @ .
METHODS	A total of @ male patients were randomly divided into @ groups of @ patients each : ( A ) DB-ACLR tunnel placement using the footprint remnant procedure ( EF group ) and ( B ) DB-ACLR tunnel placement using the bony landmark procedure ( BL group ) .
METHODS	All patients were evaluated before and after surgery .
METHODS	Outcomes were measured by KT-@ arthrometer side-to-side difference , pivot-shift test , and Tegner , Lysholm , and International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) scores .
METHODS	Second-look arthroscopic evaluations were performed in @ cases ( @ and @ cases in the EF and BL groups , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The mean follow-up time was @ months .
RESULTS	Postoperative @-dimensional computed tomography scans showed that bone sockets were variable on both femoral and tibial sides in the EF group and almost consistent in the BL group .
RESULTS	All of the evaluation indexes were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups .
RESULTS	There were no revision cases in the EF group and @ in the BL group .
RESULTS	The EF group showed a faster range of motion ( ROM ) recovery ( at @ to @ ) than did the BL group .
RESULTS	At final follow-up , there was no significant difference between the EF and BL groups in Tegner score ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) or pivot-shift test ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The EF group had a larger proportion of patients with IKDC grade A ( normal ) ( @ vs @ ; P < @ ) , smaller side-to-side difference ( @ mm vs @ mm ; P < @ ) , higher Lysholm score ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) , and better second-look arthroscopic evaluations for graft quality in the anteromedial ( P = @ ) , posterolateral ( P = @ ) , and combined bundles ( P = @ ) compared with the BL group .
CONCLUSIONS	Although both techniques provided satisfactory clinical results , DB-ACLR using the existing footprint remnant for tunnel placement showed better functional results with respect to faster ROM recovery , higher subjective outcome scores , and better arthroscopic second-look with no revision cases .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to investigate the effect of a multiple micronutrient supplement on left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) in patients with heart failure .
BACKGROUND	Observational studies suggest that patients with heart failure have reduced intake and lower concentrations of a number of micronutrients .
BACKGROUND	However , there have been very few intervention studies investigating the effect of micronutrient supplementation in patients with heart failure .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study involving @ patients with chronic stable heart failure that compared multiple micronutrient supplementation taken once daily versus placebo for @ months .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was LVEF assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging or @-dimensional echocardiography .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score , @-min walk test distance , blood concentrations of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide , C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin-@ , interleukin-@ , and urinary levels of @-iso-prostaglandin F@ alpha .
RESULTS	Blood concentrations of a number of micronutrients increased significantly in the micronutrient supplement group , indicating excellent compliance with the intervention .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in mean LVEF at @ months between treatment groups after adjusting for baseline ( mean difference : @ % , @ % confidence interval : -@ to @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was also no significant difference in any of the secondary endpoints at @ months between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides no evidence to support the routine treatment of patients with chronic stable heart failure with a multiple micronutrient supplement .

BACKGROUND	Metformin is suggested to reduce pregnancy complications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .
BACKGROUND	Metformin crosses the placenta and therapeutic concentrations are measured in the fetal circulation .
BACKGROUND	Whether metformin treatment in pregnant PCOS women affects maternal and fetal insulin concentrations at birth is not clarified .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the possible effect of metformin on insulin concentrations in umbilical cord blood and the possible association between maternal and fetal insulin concentrations .
METHODS	Post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of PCOS women participating in a double-blind randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	University hospital setting .
METHODS	Women with PCOS ( n = @ ) , aged @-@ years .
METHODS	Maternal and umbilical cord insulin concentrations immediately after birth .
RESULTS	At delivery women randomized to metformin had lower insulin concentrations than those randomized to placebo ( @ vs @pmol/l ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No difference was found in insulin concentrations in umbilical venous ( P = @ ) and arterial ( P = @ ) blood between the metformin and placebo groups .
RESULTS	The arteriovenous difference was also equal between the groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Insulin concentrations were higher in the umbilical vein than in the umbilical artery independent of randomization ( @ vs @pmol/l ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In PCOS , metformin treatment during pregnancy resulted in lower maternal insulin concentrations at delivery .
CONCLUSIONS	Metformin treatment did not affect fetal insulin concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher insulin concentrations in the umbilical vein indicate that the placenta somehow secretes insulin to the fetus .
CONCLUSIONS	The possibility of placental insulin secretion to the fetus deserves further investigations .

BACKGROUND	Cross-match-compatible platelets are used to support thrombocytopenic patients who are refractory to randomly selected platelets .
BACKGROUND	However , few studies have addressed the efficacy of using this strategy for patients requiring intensive platelet transfusion therapy .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of cross-match-compatible platelets in an unselected group of patients refractory to platelets from random donors .
METHODS	A total of @ cross-match-compatible platelet components were administered to @ evaluable patients who were refractory to random-donor platelets .
METHODS	A solid-phase red cell adherence method was used for platelet cross-matching .
METHODS	The corrected count increment was used to monitor the effectiveness of each platelet transfusion .
METHODS	Multivariate analysis was performed to detect whether any variables could predict the response to transfusion .
RESULTS	Statistically significant improvements were found in the mean corrected count increment when comparing cross-match-compatible platelets with randomly selected and incompatible platelets ( p < @ for each ) .
RESULTS	Compatible platelet transfusions were associated with a good response in @ % of cases while incompatible platelets were associated with a poor response in @ % of transfusion events ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the presence of clinical factors or alloimmunisation , compatible platelets were associated with good responses in @ % and @ % respectively vs @ % and @ % in their absence ( p = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis revealed that cross-matching and alloimmunisation were the strongest predictors of transfusion response at @ hour , while ABO compatibility , type of units received , followed by alloimmunisation then clinical factors were predictors at @ hours .
CONCLUSIONS	Platelet cross-matching using the solid-phase red cell adherence technique is an effective and rapid first-line approach for the management of patients refractory to platelet transfusions .

OBJECTIVE	Pancreatic islet transplantation stabilises glycaemic control in type @ diabetes mellitus patients with neuroglycopoenia , despite them not achieving insulin independence because of limited graft function .
OBJECTIVE	However , the extent and underlying metabolic pathways of restored glucose counterregulation are unknown .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore compared systemic glucose turnover , including lactate gluconeogenesis ( GN ) and muscle glucose uptake , in individuals with type @ diabetes who were transplant recipients with partial graft function ( T@DM/ITx ( + ) ) , matched non-transplanted individuals with type @ diabetes ( T@DM/ITx ( - ) ) and matched healthy non-diabetic individuals .
METHODS	Participants ( n = @ in each group ) underwent a euglycaemic and a hypoglycaemic ( @-@ @ mmol/l ) hyperinsulinaemic clamp ( @ mU kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) in a randomised crossover fashion .
METHODS	Systemic and skeletal muscle glucose and lactate kinetics were assessed using a combination of isotopic and forearm balance techniques .
RESULTS	Whole-body glucose counterregulation , the difference in glucose infusion rates required to maintain the glycaemic goal between the hypoglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps , was improved in T@DM/ITx ( + ) ( @ mol kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) compared with T@DM/ITx ( - ) ( @ mol kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) , but was ~ @ % lower than in controls ( @ mol kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) .
RESULTS	Increased endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) and decreased systemic glucose disposal accounted for @ % and @ % of glucose counterregulation in T@DM/ITx ( + ) , respectively , compared with @ % and @ % in controls .
RESULTS	Lactate GN increased in T@DM/ITx ( + ) ( @ mol kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) and controls ( @ mol kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) , such that it accounted for @ % and @ % of the increased EGP , respectively .
RESULTS	Skeletal muscle accounted for similar proportions of the decrease in systemic glucose disposal in controls ( @ % ) and T@DM/ITx ( + ) ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Partial islet graft function improves hypoglycaemia counterregulation by increasing EGP , largely via lactate GN and decreasing systemic glucose disposal .
CONCLUSIONS	This may explain the reduction in severe hypoglycaemic events in T@DM/ITx ( + ) individuals .

BACKGROUND	For many individuals , daily commuting activities on roadways account for a substantial proportion of total exposure , as well as peak-level exposures , to traffic-related air pollutants ( TRAPS ) including ultrafine particles , but the health impacts of these exposures are not well-understood .
BACKGROUND	We sought to determine if exposure to TRAPs particles during commuting causes acute oxidative stress in the respiratory tract or changes in heart rate variability ( HRV ) , a measure of autonomic activity .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , cross-over trial in which twenty-one young adults took two @-hr rides in a passenger vehicle in morning rush-hour traffic .
METHODS	The subjects wore a powered-air-purifying respirator , and were blinded to high-efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filtration during one of the rides .
METHODS	At time points before and after the rides , we measured HRV and markers of oxidative stress in exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) including nitrite , the sum of nitrite and nitrate , malondialdehyde , and @-isoprostane .
METHODS	We used mixed linear models to evaluate the effect of exposure on EBC and HRV outcomes , adjusting for pre-exposure response levels .
METHODS	We used linear models to examine the effects of particle concentrations on EBC outcomes at post-exposure time points .
RESULTS	Mean EBC nitrite and the sum of nitrite and nitrate were increased from baseline at immediately post-exposure comparing unfiltered to filtered rides ( @ M vs @ M , p = @ and @ M vs @ M , p = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Mean EBC malondialdehyde ( MDA ) concentrations were about @ % greater following the unfiltered vs. filtered exposures , although this result was not statistically significant .
RESULTS	We found no significant associations between exposure to traffic particles and HRV outcomes at any of the time points .
RESULTS	At immediately post-exposure , an interquartile range increase in particle number concentration was associated with statistically significant increases in nitrite ( @ % , @ % CI @ % to @ % ) and nitrite + nitrate ( @ % , @ % CI @ % to @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Increases in markers of oxidative stress in EBC may represent early biological responses to widespread exposures to TRAPs particles that affect passengers in vehicles on heavily trafficked roadways .

OBJECTIVE	Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( OPCAB ) is a popular treatment for patients with ischemic heart disease , especially for high-risk patients .
OBJECTIVE	However , whether OPCAB can lead to better clinical outcomes than on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( ONCAB ) in patients with enlarged ventricles remains controversial .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective randomized study was designed to characterize comparison of early clinical outcome and mid-term follow-up following ONCAB versus OPCAB in patients with triple-vessel disease and enlarged ventricles .
METHODS	Prospective randomized trial of patients treated at The First Affiliated Hospital , China Medical University , over a @-year period ( @-@ ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with triple-vessel disease and enlarged ventricles ( end-diastolic dimension > = @ cm ) were randomized to OPCAB or ONCAB between July @ and December @ .
METHODS	The in-hospital out.comes were analyzed .
METHODS	The study included a mid-term follow-up , with a mean follow-up time of @ ( @ months ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were recorded in the baseline clinical characteristics of ONCAB and OPCAB groups .
RESULTS	A statistical difference was found between the two groups at the time of extubation , intensive care unit stay , hospital stay , blood requirements , incidence of intra-aortic balloon pump support , pulmonary complications , stroke , reoperation for bleeding , and inotropic requirements > @ hours ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of anastomoses performed per patient , the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , new-onset atrial fibrillation , hemodialysis , infective complications , recurrent angina , and percutaneous reintervention were similar between the @ groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was significantly smaller at @ months ' follow-up in the @ groups than it was before operation ( < @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences in hospital mortality and mid-term mortality between OPCAB and ONCAB groups were found .
RESULTS	During the follow-up , no patient in either group had undergone repeat coronary artery bypass grafting .
CONCLUSIONS	No differences in early and mid-term mortality were found between OPCAB and ONCAB in patients with triple-vessel disease and enlarged ventricles .
CONCLUSIONS	However , OPCAB seems to have a beneficial effect on postoperative complications .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare the esthetic judgments of orthodontists and laypeople regarding the appearance of palatally displaced canines @ months after treatment with either a closed or an open surgical exposure and orthodontic alignment .
METHODS	A multicenter randomized controlled trial was undertaken in @ hospitals in the United Kingdom .
METHODS	Patients with unilateral palatally displaced canines were randomly allocated to receive either a closed or an open surgical exposure .
METHODS	The teeth were aligned with fixed appliances , and @ months after debond , intraoral photographs were taken .
METHODS	The photographs were projected in random order to @ panels of judges ( orthodontists and laypeople ) , who completed a questionnaire .
RESULTS	The images of @ participants ( closed , @ ; open , @ ) were included .
RESULTS	The laypeople were able to identify the operated tooth only @ % of the time ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) ; this was no better than chance ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The orthodontists were more successful but still identified the treated canine with certainty only @ % of the time ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both panels more frequently assessed the unoperated canine to have a better appearance than the contralateral operated canine ; however , there were no differences between the closed and open groups ( proportion preferring unoperated canine-laypeople : closed , @ % ; open , @ % ; P = @ ; and orthodontists : closed , @ % ; open , @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is an esthetic impact to aligning a palatally displaced canine , but it is mostly minor and unlikely to be detectable by laypeople .
CONCLUSIONS	The esthetic impact was the same , whether the canine was exposed with a closed or an open surgical technique .

BACKGROUND	Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both anxiety disorders and depression , and has been linked to deficient executive functioning , particularly working memory ( WM ) .
BACKGROUND	Previous findings show that working memory capacity can be increased through training .
METHODS	The current study explored whether an adaptive stand-alone WM training could increase WMC and consequently reduce rumination , anxiety and depression by means of a double-blind randomized controlled trial in a sample of @ patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression .
RESULTS	No positive effect of training on WMC was found .
RESULTS	In addition , the results show that a WM training was not associated with a reduction of rumination , depression , nor anxiety .
CONCLUSIONS	The high drop-out rate in both groups ( @ % from pre - to post-training ) and the overrepresentation of men and use of anti-depressants in the placebo group might have influenced the results .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , expectations and perceptions about the training might have interacted with performance on WM tasks .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , results show that a stand-alone WM training in patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression does not result in reduced rumination nor in reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety .
CONCLUSIONS	We discuss potential explanations for these findings .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety ( primary objective ) and efficacy ( secondary objective ) of ( - ) - OSU@ in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) .
METHODS	In a double-blind , cross-over trial , patients with HD were randomly assigned to start treatment on either ( - ) - OSU@ or placebo .
METHODS	After @ weeks , those patients who initially received active drug were switched to placebo for another @ weeks , and vice versa .
METHODS	During the first week the ( - ) - OSU@ dose was @ mg twice daily , during the second week @ mg twice daily , and during the last @ weeks @ mg twice daily .
METHODS	Motor , cognitive , mental and social functions were rated by the clinical investigator or by self-assessment , using established rating scales .
RESULTS	Fifteen patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria completed the study .
RESULTS	( - ) - OSU@ was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse effects were observed .
RESULTS	( - ) - OSU@ treatment significantly improved the Short Form @ Vitality score , mainly due to an improvement of the individual item ` worn-out ' ( VT@ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , an improvement of depressive symptoms was found using Beck Depression Inventory .
RESULTS	In contrast to a general trend of improvement in several non-motor variables only small and non-significant differences between ( - ) - OSU@ and placebo were found regarding motor functions .
CONCLUSIONS	( - ) - OSU@ offers promise for the treatment of HD , as a drug with good tolerability , capable of improving the patients ' experienced non-motor functions such as energy and mood and thus alleviating symptoms of great importance for their quality of life .

BACKGROUND	Neurofilaments ( Nf ) are major structural proteins that occur exclusively in neurons .
BACKGROUND	In spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , the severity of disease is quantified by clinical measures that have limited sensitivity and reliability , and no blood-based biomarker has been established to further stratify the degree of injury .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to examine a serum-based NfL immunoassay as predictor of the clinical outcome in SCI .
METHODS	Longitudinal measurement of serum NfL was performed in patients with central cord syndrome ( CCS , n = @ ) , motor-incomplete SCI ( iSCI , n = @ ) , motor-complete SCI ( cSCI , n = @ ) and healthy controls ( HC , n = @ ) , and correlated with clinical severity , neurological outcome , and neuroprotective effect of the drug minocycline .
RESULTS	Baseline NfL levels were higher in iSCI ( @pg/mL ) and cSCI ( @pg/mL ) than in HC ( @pg/mL , p = @ and p < @ ) and CCS ( @pg/mL , p = @ and p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Levels increased over time ( p < @ ) and remained higher in cSCI versus iSCI ( p = @ ) and than in CCS ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	NfL levels correlated with American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) motor score at baseline ( r = -@ , p = @ ) and after @h ( r = -@ , p < @ ) and @-@-month motor outcome ( baseline NfL : r = -@ , p = @ and @h NfL : r = -@ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Minocycline treatment showed decreased NfL levels in the subgroup of cSCI patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Serum NfL concentrations in SCI patients show a close correlation with acute severity and neurological outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data provide evidence that serum NfL is of prognostic value in SCI patients for the first time .
CONCLUSIONS	Further , blood NfL levels may qualify as drug response markers in SCI .

BACKGROUND	We previously reported that compared to standard glycemic control -LSB- blood glucose ( BG ) : @-@ mg/dL -RSB- , patients randomized to intensive glycemic control ( BG : @-@ mg/dL ) were at increased risk of graft rejection in renal transplantation .
BACKGROUND	However , the underlying mechanisms that associate the effect of intensive glycemic control with renal transplant outcomes have not been identified .
METHODS	A secondary data analysis of @ participants ( n = @ intensive , n = @ control ) was conducted using data from a previous randomized controlled clinical trial .
METHODS	We examined inflammatory biomarkers , glycemic variability , hypoglycemia , and hyperglycemia as potential contributing etiologies by assessing the effect of intensive glycemic control on these characteristics , and evaluate the association of these variables with graft rejection .
RESULTS	Intensive glycemic control had no appreciable effect on highly sensitive C-reactive protein , interleukin ( IL ) -@ , tumor necrosis factor alpha , IL-@ , or IL-@ levels at all time points after transplantation .
RESULTS	Moreover , neither inflammatory biomarkers nor increased glycemic variability were associated with graft rejection .
RESULTS	However , intensive treatment increased the risk of hypoglycemia ( BG < @ mg/dL , @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In sub-analysis , compared to non-rejecters , rejecters demonstrated higher rates of blood glucose below @ mg/dL ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Inflammatory biomarkers and increased glycemic variability lack correlation with clinical outcomes in renal transplant , but importantly , increased perioperative hypoglycemic episodes ( BG < @mg/dL ) may be a salient etiology that contributed to the increased risk for acute allograft rejection related to intensive glycemic control .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to confirm a causal association .

METHODS	A total of @ adults with vision loss from DME treated with ranibizumab were included in this analysis from RIDE/RISE .
METHODS	Participants received monthly intravitreal ranibizumab ( @ or @ mg ) .
METHODS	Differences in visual and anatomic outcomes , and diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) severity score , between subgroups of patients with baseline HbA@c @ % versus HbA@c > @ % at @ months .
RESULTS	There were @ patients in RIDE/RISE who were treated with ranibizumab with a baseline HbA@c @ % and @ patients with a baseline HbA@c > @ % included in this analysis .
RESULTS	The mean improvement in visual acuity ( VA ) at @ months was +@ Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letters in patients with baseline HbA@c @ % compared with +@ ETDRS letters in the patients with a baseline HbA@c > @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjustment for baseline central foveal thickness ( CFT ) and duration of diabetes , the mean CFT reduction was -@ m in patients with a baseline HbA@c @ % and -@ m in patients with a baseline HbA@c > @ % ( P = @ ; @ % confidence interval , -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with a @-step improvement in DR severity score was @ % in patients with baseline HbA@c @ % compared with @ % in the patients with a baseline HbA@c > @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no correlation of baseline HbA@c with any visual or anatomic parameter .
CONCLUSIONS	The improvement in VA , anatomic reduction of macular edema , and improvement in DR severity score with ranibizumab treatment seem to be independent of baseline HbA@c .

OBJECTIVE	We report the results of long-term follow-up of the Pacing to Avoid Cardiac Enlargement ( PACE ) trial , a prospective , double-blinded , randomized , multicentre study that confirmed the superiority of biventricular ( BiV ) pacing compared with right ventricular apical ( RVA ) pacing in prevention of LV adverse remodelling and deterioration of systolic function at @ and @ years .
RESULTS	Patients with bradycardia and preserved LVEF were randomized to receive RVA ( n = @ ) or BiV pacing ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Co-primary endpoints were LV end-systolic volume ( LVESV ) and LVEF measured by echocardiography .
RESULTS	There were @ patients who had extended follow-up , with a mean duration of @ @ years ( @-@ @ years ) .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint analyses were performed in @ patients ( @ in the RVA group and @ in the BiV group ) .
RESULTS	In the RVA pacing group , the LVEF decreased while the LVESV increased progressively at follow-up , but remained unchanged in the BiV pacing group .
RESULTS	The differences in LVEF between the RVA and BiV groups were -@ , -@ , and -@ % at @-year , @-year , and long-term follow-up , respectively ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The corresponding differences in LVESV were +@ , +@ , and +@ mL , respectively ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The deleterious effects of RVA pacing consistently occurred in all the pre-defined subgroups .
RESULTS	Furthermore , patients with RVA pacing had a significantly higher prevalence of heart failure hospitalization than the BiV group ( @ % vs. @ % , log-rank = @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Left ventricular adverse remodelling and deterioration of systolic function continued at long-term follow-up in patients with RVA pacing ; this deterioration was prevented by the use of BiV pacing .
CONCLUSIONS	Also , heart failure hospitalization was more prevalent in the RVA pacing group .

OBJECTIVE	No highly effective interventions to prevent delirium have been identified .
OBJECTIVE	To examine whether ramelteon , a melatonin agonist , is effective for the prevention of delirium .
METHODS	A multicenter , rater-blinded , randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed in intensive care units and regular acute wards of @ university hospitals and @ general hospital .
METHODS	Eligible patients were @ to @ years old , newly admitted due to serious medical problems , and able to take medicine orally .
METHODS	Patients were excluded from the study if they had an expected stay or life expectancy of less than @ hours .
METHODS	Sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned using the sealed envelope method to receive ramelteon ( @ mg/d ; @ patients ) or placebo ( @ patients ) every night for @ days .
METHODS	Incidence of delirium , as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Fourth Edition ) .
RESULTS	Ramelteon was associated with a lower risk of delirium ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) , with a relative risk of @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Even after risk factors were controlled for , ramelteon was still associated with a lower incidence of delirium ( P = @ ; odds ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to development of delirium were @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) days for ramelteon and @ ( @-@ @ ) days for placebo .
RESULTS	Comparison by log-rank test showed that the frequency of delirium was significantly lower in patients taking ramelteon than in those taking placebo ( ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Ramelteon administered nightly to elderly patients admitted for acute care may provide protection against delirium .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding supports a possible pathogenic role of melatonin neurotransmission in delirium .

OBJECTIVE	Consumption of energy drinks is increasing amongst athletes and the general public .
OBJECTIVE	By virtue of their bioactive ingredients ( including caffeine , taurine , glucuronolactone , and B-group vitamins ) and paucity of calories , sugar-free `` diet '' versions of these drinks could be a useful aid for weight maintenance .
OBJECTIVE	Yet little is known about the acute influence of these drinks , and specifically the role of the cocktail of non-caffeine ingredients , on resting energy expenditure ( REE ) and substrate oxidation .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , the metabolic impact of sugar-free Red Bull ( sfRB ) to a comparable amount of caffeine was compared .
METHODS	REE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were measured in eight healthy young men by ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry for @ min baseline and @ h following ingestion of @ ml of either : sfRB + placebo , water +@ mg caffeine , or water + placebo , according to a randomized cross-over design .
RESULTS	sfRB and water + caffeine both increased REE to the same degree ( +@ % ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , sfRB briefly increased RQ .
RESULTS	Water + caffeine had no effect on RQ relative to water + placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	sfRB enhanced thermogenesis and marginally shifted RQ to favor carbohydrate oxidation .
CONCLUSIONS	The stimulatory effects of sfRB on REE are mimicked by water + caffeine , indicating that the auxiliary ingredients do not influence this thermic effect .
CONCLUSIONS	The metabolic effects of sfRB are primarily due to caffeine alone .

BACKGROUND	The safety and efficacy of a brief hydration protocol using sodium bicarbonate in this population is unknown .
BACKGROUND	We analysed whether @-h sodium bicarbonate hydration prior to CE-CT is non-inferior to saline hydration prior to and after CE-CT in CKD patients .
METHODS	We performed an open-label multicentre randomized trial .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to @ mL of @ % sodium bicarbonate hydration prior to CE-CT or @ mL of @ % saline hydration prior to and , once again , after CE-CT .
METHODS	Primary outcome was the relative increase in serum creatinine @-@ h post-CE-CT .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were incidence of CI-AKI -LSB- serum creatinine increase > @ % / > @ mol/L ( @ mg/dL ) -RSB- , recovery of renal function , the need for dialysis and @-month hospital costs .
RESULTS	Five hundred and seventy adult CKD patients undergoing CE-CT were randomized between @ and @ , of whom @ were included in the intention-to-treat population .
RESULTS	Mean relative serum creatinine increase was @ % for sodium bicarbonate and @ % for saline ( mean difference -@ % ; @ % confidence interval -@ to @ , P-value for non-inferiority < @ ) .
RESULTS	CI-AKI occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) ; @ ( @ % ) randomized to sodium bicarbonate versus @ ( @ % ) to saline ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Renal function recovered in @ and @ % of CI-AKI patients , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No patients developed a need for dialysis .
RESULTS	Mean hydration costs per patient were @ for the sodium bicarbonate and @ for the saline regime ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Other healthcare costs were similar .
CONCLUSIONS	Short hydration with sodium bicarbonate prior to CE-CT was non-inferior to peri-procedural saline hydration with respect to renal safety and may result in healthcare savings .

BACKGROUND	Successful recruitment of participants to any trial is central to its success .
BACKGROUND	Trial results are routinely published , and recruitment is often cited to be slower and more difficult than anticipated .
BACKGROUND	This article reflects on the methodological challenges of recruiting women with prolapse attending United Kingdom ( UK ) gynaecology outpatient clinics to a multi-centre randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) of physiotherapy , and the systems put in place in an attempt to address them .
METHODS	Gynaecology outpatients with symptomatic prolapse were to be recruited over a @-month period from @ UK hospitals and one New Zealand hospital .
METHODS	Eligible women were informed about the trial by their gynaecologist and informed consent was obtained by the central trial office .
METHODS	Recruitment difficulties were encountered early on , and a number of strategies were employed to try to improve recruitment .
RESULTS	Some strategies were more successful than others and they differed in the resources required .
RESULTS	Actions that facilitated recruitment included increasing recruiting centres to @ UK and two international hospitals , good centre support , using processes embedded in clinical practice , and good communication between the trial office , collaborators and participants .
RESULTS	Collaborator incentives , whereby staff involved received the benefit immediately , were more successful than a nominal monetary payment per woman randomised .
RESULTS	Barriers to recruitment included fewer eligible women than anticipated , patient 's preference to receive active treatment rather than allocation to the control group , lack of support staff and high staff turnover .
RESULTS	Geographical variations in Primary Care Trust Research Management and Governance approval systems and general practitioner ( GP ) referral procedures also impacted negatively on recruitment .
CONCLUSIONS	Our article reflects on the methodological challenges of recruiting to a multi-centre RCT in a UK gynaecology setting .
CONCLUSIONS	Effective interventions included increasing the number of recruiting centres and providing collaborator incentives .
CONCLUSIONS	Barriers to recruitment included fewer eligible women than anticipated , patient 's preference to be allocated to the treatment group , lack of support staff , and variations in approval systems and GP referral procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	To improve the evidence base on clinical trial recruitment , trialists need to publish their experiences and lessons learned .
CONCLUSIONS	Future RCTs should evaluate , where possible , the effect of strategies designed to improve recruitment and retention .

OBJECTIVE	Determining efficacy in complementary medicine research requires valid placebo/sham control groups that are credible to patients and ensure successful blinding .
OBJECTIVE	Within the scope of this study , a light touch sham-control intervention for trials of Craniosacral Therapy ( CST ) was developed and tested for its credibility .
METHODS	Patients of a randomized controlled trial on chronic non-specific neck pain ( NCT@ ) obtained the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire and the Helping Alliance/Satisfaction Questionnaire .
METHODS	Treatment and sham group respectively received @ weekly sessions of CST or light touch .
METHODS	Data without ( N = @ ) and with multiple imputation ( N = @ ) were analyzed separately using logistic regression models .
METHODS	Adjusted odds ratios ( AOR ) and @ % confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated to assess whether group outcome could be predicted from patients ' credibility ratings .
METHODS	An additional t-test for analysis of the overall compliance/attendance was conducted .
RESULTS	Patients ' ratings of treatment expectancy , credibility and therapeutic alliance were not found to have significant power for classifying patients into CST or sham group ( p. @ ) .
RESULTS	Only satisfaction with treatment revealed a significant impact ( AOR : @ ; @ % CI : -LSB- @ | @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) in the non-imputed analysis , but not in the multiple imputation analysis ( AOR : @ ; @ % CI : -LSB- @ | @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compliance of both groups was not significantly different ( p > @ ) as were reasons for non-attendance .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients ' expectancy , credibility and therapeutic alliance did not appear to affect study outcomes , blinding patients to group allocation was possible , and sham intervention was tolerable and safe .
CONCLUSIONS	The design can therefore be recommended as control for non-specific treatment effects in future CST clinical trials .

BACKGROUND	Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system .
BACKGROUND	Riboflavin is involved in myelin formation in nerve cells .
BACKGROUND	Riboflavin is a precursor of flavin adenine D-nucleotide ( FAD ) , which is a coenzyme of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) , which is an important enzyme for remethylation of homocysteine .
BACKGROUND	Riboflavin supplementation has been shown to affect the serum levels of homocysteine in healthy volunteers .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to test the effect of riboflavin supplementation on the status and disability of patients with MS and whether this effect could be mediated by serum homocysteine levels .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , controlled trial in which @ MS patients with a mean age of @ were tested with riboflavin , and the placebo group , with a mean age of @ , received either riboflavin supplementation ( @ mg ) or the placebo daily for six months .
METHODS	Disability , measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) scores , erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient ( EGRAC ) , and serum homocysteine levels were measured before and after the study .
RESULTS	The mean SD of EDSS score was significantly decreased in both groups over the six months of the study ( @ @ vs. @ @ for the riboflavin group and @ @ vs. @ @ for the placebo groups .
RESULTS	The comparison across both groups yielded a non-significant change ( P = @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of EGRAC , riboflavin deficiency levels by EGRAC category , and serum homocysteine levels before and after the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Riboflavin supplementation ( @ mg/day ) to patients with MS does not improve disability status .
CONCLUSIONS	It appears that this effect is not related to serum homocysteine levels .

BACKGROUND	The ICON@ trial previously reported improved progression-free survival in women with ovarian cancer with the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy , with the greatest effect in patients at high risk of disease progression .
BACKGROUND	We report the final overall survival results of the trial .
METHODS	ICON@ was an international , phase @ , open-label , randomised trial undertaken at @ centres in @ countries across Europe , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
METHODS	Eligible adult women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage disease ( International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics -LSB- FIGO -RSB- stage I-IIa , grade @ or clear cell histology ) or more advanced disease ( FIGO stage IIb-IV ) , with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of @-@ , were enrolled and randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to standard chemotherapy ( six @-weekly cycles of intravenous carboplatin -LSB- AUC @ or @ -RSB- and paclitaxel @ mg/m ( @ ) of body surface area ) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab @ mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every @ weeks , given concurrently and continued with up to @ further @-weekly cycles of maintenance therapy .
METHODS	Randomisation was done by a minimisation algorithm stratified by FIGO stage , residual disease , interval between surgery and chemotherapy , and Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup group .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ; the study was also powered to detect a difference in overall survival .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Between Dec @ , @ , and Feb @ , @ , @ women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy ( n = @ ) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up at the end of the trial on March @ , @ , was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , at which point @ patients had died ( @ in the chemotherapy group and @ in the bevacizumab group ) .
RESULTS	Our results showed evidence of non-proportional hazards , so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect .
RESULTS	No overall survival benefit of bevacizumab was recorded ( restricted mean survival time @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- in the standard chemotherapy group vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the bevacizumab group ; log-rank p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In an exploratory analysis of a predefined subgroup of @ patients with poor prognosis disease , @ ( @ % ) died ( @ in the standard chemotherapy group and @ in the bevacizumab group ) , and a significant difference in overall survival was noted between women who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and those who received chemotherapy alone ( restricted mean survival time @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- with standard chemotherapy vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- with bevacizumab ; log-rank p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , in non-high-risk patients , the restricted mean survival time did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups ( @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) in the standard chemotherapy group vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the bevacizumab group ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	An updated analysis of progression-free survival showed no difference between treatment groups .
RESULTS	During extended follow-up , one further treatment-related grade @ event ( gastrointestinal fistula in a bevacizumab-treated patient ) , three grade @ treatment-related events ( cardiac failure , sarcoidosis , and foot fracture , all in bevacizumab-treated patients ) , and one grade @ treatment-related event ( vaginal haemorrhage , in a patient treated with standard chemotherapy ) were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Bevacizumab , added to platinum-based chemotherapy , did not increase overall survival in the study population as a whole .
CONCLUSIONS	However , an overall survival benefit was recorded in poor-prognosis patients , which is concordant with the progression-free survival results from ICON@ and GOG-@ , and provides further evidence towards the optimum use of bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer .

BACKGROUND	Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) following a confirmed parasitological diagnosis is recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Congolese National Malaria Control Program ( NMCP ) .
BACKGROUND	However , commitment and competence of all stakeholders ( patients , medical professionals , governments and funders ) is required to achieve effective case management and secure the `` useful therapeutic life '' of the recommended drugs .
BACKGROUND	The health seeking behaviour of patients and health care professionals ' practices for malaria management were assessed .
METHODS	This was an observational study embedded in a two-stage cluster randomized survey conducted in one health centre ( HC ) in each of the @ selected health zones in Kinshasa city .
METHODS	All patients with clinical malaria diagnosis were eligible .
METHODS	Their health seeking behaviour was recorded on a specific questionnaire , as well as the health care practitioners ' practices .
METHODS	The last were not aware that their practices would be assessed .
RESULTS	Six hundred and twenty four patients were assessed , of whom @ ( @ % ) were under five years .
RESULTS	Three hundred and thirty five ( @ % ) had taken medication prior to the current consultation ( self - medication with any product or visiting another HC ) of whom @ ( @ % ) took an antimalarial drug , and @ ( @ % ) were treated presumptively .
RESULTS	Among those , @ % received monotherapy either with quinine , artesunate , phytomedicines , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine .
RESULTS	On the other side , when clinicians were informed about laboratory results , monotherapy was prescribed in @ % of the confirmed malaria cases .
RESULTS	Only @ patients ( @ % ) were managed in line with WHO and NMCP guidelines , of whom @ ( @ % ) were prescribed an ACT after positive blood smear and @ ( @ % ) received no antimalarial after a negative result .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows the discrepancy between malaria policies and the reality on the field in Kinshasa , regarding patients ' health seeking behaviour and health professionals ' practices .
CONCLUSIONS	Consequently , the poor compliance to the policies may contribute to the genesis and spread of antimalarial drug resistance and also have a negative impact on the burden of the disease .

BACKGROUND	Chinese Americans are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection .
BACKGROUND	To reduce or eliminate disparities in HBV-related infection rates , participation in scientific investigations of HBV risk and treatment , including biospecimen sampling , is important .
BACKGROUND	However , Asian Americans have low rates of participation in biospecimen research , and little is known about how educational interventions affect knowledge and participation in HBV-related biospecimen research .
METHODS	Eight Chinese community-based organizations participated in a quasi-experimental , two-group design with education assessments at pre - and postworkshop and a @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Four sites were randomly assigned to receive the intervention ( n = @ ) and four sites to receive general health education ( control ; n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Participant knowledge about biospecimen research increased from pre - to posteducation in the intervention but not in the control condition .
RESULTS	Of intervention participants , @ % ( @/@ ) donated one tube of blood for future HBV biospecimen research , and @ % ( @/@ ) donated another tube of blood for HBV testing .
RESULTS	In contrast , only @ % of participants in the control condition reported donating a blood sample at follow-up assessment .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention program significantly increased knowledge of and participation in HBV biospecimen research among Chinese Americans .
CONCLUSIONS	Community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) methods featured active support by community leaders , a culturally specific curriculum , and convenient , immediate access to blood sampling , which resulted in high donation rates .
CONCLUSIONS	HBV-related morbidity and mortality is an urgent problem faced by Chinese Americans .
CONCLUSIONS	CBPR provides a model for engaging communities in early detection , vaccination , and treatment that can reduce this health threat .

BACKGROUND	Bronchospasm results in airway obstruction in horses with heaves .
BACKGROUND	Atropine is the most potent bronchodilator drug currently available for horses , but is associated with side effects that limit its use .
BACKGROUND	Like atropine , N-butylscopolammonium bromide ( NBB ) is an anticholinergic agent with bronchodilatory properties .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the bronchodilating effects and side effects of atropine and NBB in horses with heaves .
METHODS	Cross-over experiment using horses with heaves .
METHODS	Eight horses with heaves were administered atropine and NBB , using a cross-over design .
METHODS	Heart rate , pupillary dilatation , transrectal palpation , lung mechanics ( maximal changes in transpulmonary pressure , pulmonary resistance and elastance ) and arterial blood gases were assessed before and @ and @min after drug administration .
RESULTS	One horse treated with atropine developed colic .
RESULTS	Significant pupillary dilatation was observed only with atropine .
RESULTS	Tachycardia developed in all horses , but was more marked with atropine .
RESULTS	Lung function improved with both drugs , but elastance values had returned to baseline at @min with NBB .
RESULTS	There was no improvement in arterial hypoxaemia with either drug .
CONCLUSIONS	The study indicated that the bronchodilatory properties of NBB were not statistically different from those of atropine , but were of shorter duration .
CONCLUSIONS	N-butylscopolammonium bromide was associated with fewer systemic side effects , and therefore NBB should be preferred over atropine when assessing the reversibility of airway obstruction in horses .

OBJECTIVE	To assess driving ability ( brake response time -LSB- BRT -RSB- ) with commonly used knee braces .
METHODS	Sixty-four healthy participants ( @ women and @ men ) participated in our study .
METHODS	BRT was assessed using a custom-made driving simulator .
METHODS	We assessed BRT for @ different commonly used knee braces ( right leg ) used in @ different settings : without a knee brace ( control group ) ; with a typical postoperative knee brace with adjustable range of motion ( ROM ) and the settings of @ to @ , @ to @ , @ to @ , and @ to @ ( extension and flexion ) ; and with an unloading knee brace for moderate to severe unicompartmental osteoarthritis , an orthosis for ligament instabilities , a knee brace for patellofemoral disorders , and an elastic knee bandage .
RESULTS	The @ participants ( mean age , @ years ) showed significantly impaired BRT with the typical postoperative brace set at an ROM of @ to @ ( @ milliseconds , P < @ ) , ROM of @ to @ ( @ milliseconds , P < @ ) , ROM of @ to @ ( @ milliseconds , P = @ ) , and ROM of @ to @ ( @ milliseconds , P = @ ) compared with the control group .
RESULTS	However , no such impaired BRT was found for any other investigated knee brace .
CONCLUSIONS	Right-sided ROM-restricting knee braces involve significant impairment of BRT in healthy participants .
CONCLUSIONS	No such prolonged BRT was found for a patellofemoral realignment brace , a ligament brace , a valgus/osteoarthritis brace , or an elastic knee bandage .
CONCLUSIONS	However , our findings should be viewed in light of the limitations of the study , which are ( @ ) the lack of a defined decrease in BRT that could lead to an accident and ( @ ) uncertainty of whether the statistical differences are also clinically important .
METHODS	Level II , lesser-quality randomized controlled trial .

BACKGROUND	We previously demonstrated the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of a web-based assessment following total hip or total knee arthroplasty .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study was to conduct an economic evaluation to compare a web-based assessment with in-person follow-up .
METHODS	Patients who had undergone total joint arthroplasty at least twelve months previously were randomized to complete a web-based follow-up or visit the clinic for the usual follow-up .
METHODS	We recorded travel costs and time associated with each option .
METHODS	We followed patients for one year after the web-based or in-person follow-up evaluation and documented any resource use related to the joint arthroplasty .
METHODS	We conducted cost analyses from the health-care payer ( Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care ) and societal perspectives .
METHODS	All costs are presented in @ Canadian dollars .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ in the web-based group , @ in the usual-care group ) completed the study .
RESULTS	The mean cost of the assessment from the societal perspective was $ @ per patient for the web-based assessment and $ @ per patient for the usual method of in-person follow-up .
RESULTS	The cost for the web-based assessment was significantly lower from the societal perspective ( mean difference , $ -@ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , $ -@ to $ -@ ; p < @ ) and also from the health-care payer perspective ( mean difference , $ -@ ; @ % CI , $ -@ to $ -@ ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The web-based follow-up assessment had a lower cost per patient compared with in-person follow-up from both societal and health-care payer perspectives .

BACKGROUND	Despite aggressive local therapy , patients with locally advanced bladder cancer have a significant risk of distant metastases .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the role of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin ( GC ) in improving the outcome of this group of patients over radical cystectomy alone .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer ( T@-@ , N@-@ , M@ ) were randomized to radical cystectomy alone or initial @ cycles of GC , then managed according to response .
METHODS	Patients who achieved complete response completed @ cycles of GC followed by local radiation therapy ( RT ) only .
METHODS	If tumors were downstaged to T@ , complete transurethral resection was done , followed by @ cycles of GC and then RT. .
METHODS	Patients with partial response underwent radical cystectomy followed by @ cycles of GC .
METHODS	Patients with stable disease or disease progression underwent radical cystectomy .
RESULTS	The overall response rate to GC was @ % , and complete response was achieved in @ % .
RESULTS	The @-year overall survival ( OS ) was @ % versus @ % in the chemotherapy and surgery arms , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-year disease-free survival was @ % in the chemotherapy arm and @ % in the surgery arm ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Bladder preservation was achieved in @ % of patients in the neoadjuvant arm .
RESULTS	OS was @ % in responding patients and @ % in patients with complete response .
CONCLUSIONS	Neoadjuvant GC did not improve survival in locally advanced bladder cancer over radical cystectomy alone .
CONCLUSIONS	However , bladder preservation was feasible , and OS in responding patients was impressive .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , predictive models to select patients are needed .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the largest prospective study of squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma using neoadjuvant GC .

BACKGROUND	Iodine deficiency in infants can damage the developing brain and increase mortality .
BACKGROUND	Present recommendations state that oral iodised oil should be given to breastfeeding mothers to correct iodine deficiency in infancy when iodised salt is not available , and that direct supplementation should be given to infants who are not being breastfed or receiving iodine-fortified complimentary foods .
BACKGROUND	However , there is little evidence for these recommendations .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of direct versus indirect supplementation of the infant .
METHODS	We did this double blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial in Morocco .
METHODS	Healthy breastfeeding mothers and their term newborn babies ( aged @ weeks ) were block randomised by clinic day to receive either : one dose of @ mg iodine to the mother and placebo to the infant ( indirect infant supplementation ) , or one dose of about @ mg iodine to the infant and placebo to the mother ( direct infant supplementation ) .
METHODS	Randomisation was masked to participants and investigators .
METHODS	Coprimary outcomes were : maternal and infant urinary iodine concentrations , breastmilk iodine concentration , maternal and infant thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) concentrations , maternal and infant thyroxine ( T@ ) concentrations , and infant growth .
METHODS	These outcomes were measured at baseline , and when infants were aged about @ months , @ months , and @ months , and the two groups were compared using mixed effects models .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We recruited @ mother-infant pairs between Feb @ , and Aug @ , @ , and completed data collection by Aug @ , @ .
RESULTS	At baseline , median urinary iodine concentration was @ g/L ( IQR @-@ ) in mothers and @ g/L ( @-@ ) in infants , suggesting iodine deficiency .
RESULTS	During the study , maternal urinary iodine concentration ( p = @ ) , breastmilk iodine concentration ( p < @ ) , and infant urinary iodine concentration ( p = @ ) were higher in the indirect infant supplementation group than in the direct supplementation group .
RESULTS	Maternal TSH ( p = @ ) and T@ ( p = @ ) concentrations did not differ between the groups over the course of the study , nor did infant TSH ( p = @ ) and T@ ( p = @ ) concentrations , but the number of infants with thyroid hypofunction was lower ( p = @ ) in the indirect supplementation group than the direct supplementation group .
RESULTS	The infant groups did not differ in anthropomorphic measures , except that length-for-age Z score was slightly greater in the direct infant supplementation group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ months and @ months of age , median infant urinary iodine concentration in the indirect infant supplementation group was sufficient ( > @ g/L ) , whereas infant urinary iodine concentration was sufficient only at @ months in the direct supplementation group .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	In regions of moderate-to-severe iodine deficiency without effective salt iodisation , lactating women who receive one dose of @ mg iodine as oral iodised oil soon after delivery can provide adequate iodine to their infants through breastmilk for at least @ months , enabling the infants to achieve euthyroidism .
CONCLUSIONS	Direct supplementation is less effective in improving infant iodine status .

OBJECTIVE	The intention of the PEPCAD China ISR ( A Prospective , Multicenter , Randomized Trial of Paclitaxel-Coated versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent for the Treatment of Drug-Eluting Stent In-Stent Restenosis ) was to demonstrate the efficacy of paclitaxel-coated balloon ( PCB ) angioplasty in a non-European patient population with coronary drug-eluting stent in-stent restenosis ( DES-ISR ) .
BACKGROUND	The treatment of DES-ISR is still challenging with no established best strategy .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , there is no study on the effect of PCB in the treatment of ISR in the Chinese population .
METHODS	PEPCAD China ISR was a @-patient randomized ( @:@ ) , single-blind prospective multicenter trial conducted in China .
METHODS	Patients with coronary DES-ISR received either PCB ( SeQuent Please , B. Braun Melsungen AG , Melsungen , Germany ) or paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus Libert , Boston Scientific , Natick , Massachusetts ) treatment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was in-segment late lumen loss at @ months .
RESULTS	There were no significant baseline differences between both treatment groups in terms of patient , lesion , or procedural characteristics .
RESULTS	At @ months , in-segment late lumen loss in the PCB group was noninferior to that of the paclitaxel-eluting stent group ( @ @ mm vs. @ @ mm ; difference : -@ mm with @ % confidence interval : -@ to @ ; p for noninferiority = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-month rate of binary restenosis and @-month composite clinical event rates were not significantly different between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In a randomized trial of @ patients , angioplasty with a PCB was noninferior to paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation when used to treat DES-ISR .
CONCLUSIONS	On the basis of these , as well as previous randomized trial data , PCB angioplasty offers an effective treatment for DES-ISR without the necessity of implanting additional metal layers for drug release .
CONCLUSIONS	( A Safety and Efficacy Study of Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloon to Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent -LSB- PEPCAD -RSB- ; NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates ( PCCs ) , which contain factorII , FVII , FIX , and FX , have shown the potential to reverse the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in healthy volunteers .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine whether a three-factor PCC , which contains little FVII , has a similar effect .
RESULTS	We performed an open-label , single-center , parallel-group study comparing the effect of a three-factor PCC ( ProfilnineSD ) with that of a four-factor PCC ( BeriplexP/N ) on the pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in @ healthy volunteers .
RESULTS	After receiving @days of rivaroxaban @mg twice daily to obtain supratherapeutic steady-state concentrations , volunteers were randomized to receive a single @IUkg ( -@ ) bolus dose of four-factor PCC , three-factor PCC or saline @h after the morning dose of rivaroxaban on day@ , and the effects of these interventions on prothrombin time and thrombin generation were determined .
RESULTS	Within @min , four-factor PCC reduced mean prothrombin time by @-@ @ s , whereas three-factor PCC produced only a @-@ @ - s reduction .
RESULTS	In contrast , three-factor PCC reversed rivaroxaban-induced changes in thrombin generation more than four-factor PCC .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates the potential of both three-factor and four-factor PCCs to at least partially reverse the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in healthy adults .
CONCLUSIONS	The discrepant effects of the PCC preparations may reflect differences in the procoagulant components present in each .

BACKGROUND	Dental care is a significant unmet health care need for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) .
BACKGROUND	Many children with ASD do not receive dental care because of fear associated with dental procedures ; oftentimes they require general anesthesia for regular dental procedures , placing them at risk of associated complications .
BACKGROUND	Many children with ASD have a strong preference for visual stimuli , particularly electronic screen media .
BACKGROUND	The use of visual teaching materials is a fundamental principle in designing educational programs for children with ASD .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if an innovative strategy using @ types of electronic screen media was feasible and beneficial in reducing fear and uncooperative behaviors in children with ASD undergoing dental visits .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized controlled trial at Boston Children 's Hospital dental clinic .
METHODS	Eighty ( @ ) children aged @ to @ years with a known diagnosis of ASD and history of dental fear were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	Each child completed @ preventive dental visits that were scheduled @ months apart ( visit @ and visit @ ) .
METHODS	After visit @ , subjects were randomly assigned to @ of @ groups : ( @ ) group A , control ( usual care ) ; ( @ ) group B , treatment ( video peer modeling that involved watching a DVD recording of a typically developing child undergoing a dental visit ) ; ( @ ) group C , treatment ( video goggles that involved watching a favorite movie during the dental visit using sunglass-style video eyewear ) ; and ( @ ) group D , treatment ( video peer modeling plus video goggles ) .
METHODS	Subjects who refused or were unable to wear the goggles watched the movie using a handheld portable DVD player .
METHODS	During both visits , the subject 's level of anxiety and behavior were measured using the Venham Anxiety and Behavior Scales .
METHODS	Analyses of variance and Fisher 's exact tests compared baseline characteristics across groups .
METHODS	Using intention to treat approach , repeated measures analyses were employed to test whether the outcomes differed significantly : ( @ ) between visits @ and @ within each group and ( @ ) between each intervention group and the control group over time ( an interaction ) .
RESULTS	Between visits @ and @ , mean anxiety and behavior scores decreased significantly by @ points ( P = @ ) for subjects within groups C and D. Significant changes were not observed within groups A and B. Mean anxiety and behavior scores did not differ significantly between groups over time , although group A versus C pairwise comparisons showed a trend toward significance ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that certain electronic screen media technologies may be useful tools for reducing fear and uncooperative behaviors among children with ASD undergoing dental visits .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these strategies using larger sample sizes .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings from future studies could be relevant for nondental providers who care for children with ASD in other medical settings .

BACKGROUND	Increasing chest compression rate during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can affect the workload and , ultimately , the quality of chest compression .
BACKGROUND	This study examines the effects of compression at the rate of as-fast-as-you-can on cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) performance .
METHODS	A crossover , randomized-to-order design was used .
METHODS	Each participant performed chest compressions without ventilation on a manikin with @ compression rates : @ per minute ( @-cpm ) and `` push as-fast-as you-can '' ( PF ) .
METHODS	The participants performed chest compressions at a rate of either @-cpm or PF and subsequently switched to the other after a @-minute rest .
RESULTS	Forty-two CPR-qualified nonprofessionals voluntarily participated in the study .
RESULTS	During the PF session , the rescuers performed CPR with higher compression rates ( @ vs @ cpm ) , more compressions ( @ vs @ per @ minutes ) , and more duty cycles ( @ % vs @ % ) , but a lower percentage of effective compressions ( @ % vs @ % ) and a lower compression depth ( @ vs @ mm ) than they did during the @-cpm session .
RESULTS	The CPR quality deteriorated in numbers and percentile of effective compression since the third minute in the PF session and the fourth minute in the @-cpm session .
RESULTS	The percentile of compressions with adequate depth in the @-cpm sessions was higher than that in the PF sessions during the second , third , and fourth minutes of CPR .
CONCLUSIONS	Push-fast technique showed a significant decrease in the percentile of effective chest compression compared with the @-cpm technique during the @-minute hand-only CPR .
CONCLUSIONS	The PF technique exhibited a trend toward increased fatigue in the rescuers , which can result in early decay of CPR quality .

BACKGROUND	Long-term management of chronic conditions , such as atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , require frequent interactions with the healthcare systems .
BACKGROUND	The multinational EUropean Patient Survey in Atrial Fibrillation ( EUPS-AF ) was conducted to investigate patient satisfaction with AF management in different of five European healthcare systems at a time of changing treatment paradigms for stroke prophylaxis , prior to the advent of newer oral anticoagulants .
METHODS	Adults ( > @ years ) were recruited at random from the total populations of France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the UK using a randomized telephone dialling system .
METHODS	At least @ respondents per country reporting to have a diagnosis of AF or receiving oral anticoagulation therapy for suspected AF or to have a heart rhythm disturbance completed a structured telephone interview .
RESULTS	Most respondents were satisfied with their treatment for AF over the previous @ months , with @ % ( n = @ ) rating their care as good or better .
RESULTS	Suboptimal clinical practices , however , were identified in several key areas .
RESULTS	Coordination of primary and secondary care and a lack of patient engagement and support were particular issues , especially for those patients likely to have extensive contact with their healthcare system .
CONCLUSIONS	In the context of Europe-wide guidelines for management of AF , most patients with AF were satisfied with their care , but for a greater proportion of patients , some aspects are unsatisfactory .
CONCLUSIONS	Patient-centred surveys , such as the EUPS-AF , are crucial for understanding the factors that contribute to patient satisfaction and compliance with long-term treatment for chronic conditions .

BACKGROUND	Isovolemic anemia ( decrease in hemoglobin concentration with normal or even increased blood volume ) after gastric cancer surgery may negatively influence short - and long-term outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Therefore correction of isovolemic postoperative anemia is supposed to be beneficial .
BACKGROUND	This prospective randomized placebo-controlled multicenter trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose administration with the primary end point of successful hemoglobin level increase by @ g/dl at @ weeks after randomization .
METHODS	Gastric cancer patients after oncologic resection and postoperative hemoglobin level@ g/dl to < @ g/dl at postoperative days @ to @ will be eligible for trial inclusion .
METHODS	After randomization , @ patients ( @ per group ) are going to be subjected either to administration of ferric carboxymaltose ( treatment group ) or normal ( @ % ) saline ( placebo group ) .
METHODS	Patients will be blinded to the intervention .
METHODS	Patients will undergo evaluation for hemoglobin level , hematology and quality of life assessment @ and @ weeks after randomization .
CONCLUSIONS	Correction of isovolemic postoperative anemia in gastric cancer patients after oncologic resection is considered to be beneficial .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of ferric carboxymaltose is considered to be superior to placebo for anemia correction without the possible risks of red blood cell transfusion .
CONCLUSIONS	Further , improved quality of life for patients with quick recovery of hemoglobin levels is expected .

BACKGROUND	Hyperandrogenism and inflammation are related in polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .
BACKGROUND	Hyperandrogenemia can induce inflammation in reproductive-age women , but the mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We examined the in vivo and in vitro effects of hyperandrogenism on mononuclear cell ( MNC ) - derived androgen receptor ( AR ) status and TNF release .
METHODS	This study combined a randomized , controlled , double-blind protocol with laboratory-based cell culture experiments .
METHODS	This work was performed in an academic medical center .
METHODS	Lean , healthy , reproductive-age women were treated with @ mg of dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) or placebo ( n = @ subjects each ) for @ days and also provided untreated fasting blood samples ( n = @ subjects ) for cell culture experiments .
METHODS	AR mRNA content and TNF release were measured before and after DHEA administration in the fasting state and @ hours after glucose ingestion .
METHODS	TNF release in the fasting state was also measured in cultured MNCs exposed to androgens with or without flutamide preincubation .
RESULTS	At baseline , subjects receiving DHEA or placebo exhibited no significant difference in androgens and TNF release from MNCs before and after glucose ingestion .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , DHEA administration raised levels of T , androstenedione , and DHEA sulfate , and increased MNC-derived AR mRNA content and TNF release in the fasting state and in response to glucose ingestion .
RESULTS	Compared with MNC exposure to baseline concentrations of DHEA ( @ ng/dL ) or T ( @ ng/dL ) , the absolute change in TNF release increased after exposure to T concentrations of @ and @ ng/dL and a DHEA concentration of @ ng/dL .
RESULTS	Preincubation with flutamide reduced the TNF response by @ % across all T concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Androgen excess in vivo and in vitro comparable to what is present in PCOS increases TNF release from MNCs of lean healthy reproductive-age women in a receptor-dependent fashion .
CONCLUSIONS	Hyperandrogenemia activates and sensitizes MNCs to glucose in this population .

BACKGROUND	Drug-coated balloons ( DCBs ) have shown promise in improving the outcomes for patients with peripheral artery disease .
BACKGROUND	We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease .
RESULTS	The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective , multicenter , single-blinded , randomized trial in which @ patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA .
RESULTS	The primary efficacy end point was primary patency , defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at @ months .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar between the @ groups .
RESULTS	Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were @ @ and @ @ cm ( P = @ ) and @ % and @ % ( P = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA ( @ % versus @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was @ % in the DCB arm in comparison with @ % in the PTA arm ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms ( @ % after DCB and @ % after PTA -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	There were no device - or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations .
CONCLUSIONS	In this prospective , multicenter , randomized trial , DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease .

METHODS	We allocated forty patients randomly into two equal groups .
METHODS	We then maintained dexmedetomidine infusion ( @ g.kg-@ .
METHODS	min-@ ) for @ minutes .
METHODS	Next , we continued it until the last @ minutes of the operation at a dose of @ g.kg ( -@ ) .
METHODS	hour ( -@ ) .
METHODS	We administered thiopental ( @-@ mg .
METHODS	kg ( -@ ) ) and @-@ @ mg.kg ( -@ ) vecuronium bromide at induction for both groups .
METHODS	We used isoflurane ( @ % ) for anesthesia maintenance .
METHODS	Group N received a @ % O@-N@O mixture and Group A received @ % O - air mixture as carrier gas .
METHODS	We started low-flow anesthesia ( @ L.min ( -@ ) ) after a @-minute period of initial high flow ( @ L.min ( -@ ) ) .
METHODS	We recorded values for blood pressure , heart rate , peripheral O@ saturation , inspiratory isoflurane , expiratory isoflurane , inspiratory O@ , expiratory O@ , inspiratory N@O , expiratory N@O , inspiratory CO@ , CO@ concentration after expiration , Minimum Alveolar Concentration .
METHODS	In addition , we determined the total consumption rate of fentanyl , dexmedetomidine and isoflurane as well as bleeding .
RESULTS	In each group the heart rate decreased after dexmedetomidine loading .
RESULTS	After intubation , values were higher for Group A at one , three , five , @ , and @ minutes .
RESULTS	After intubation , the patients reached desired hypotension values at minute five for Group N and at minute @ for group A. MAC values were higher for Group N at minute one , three , five , @ , and @ ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	FiO@ values were high between minute five and @ for Group A , while at minute @ Group N values were higher ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Fi Iso ( inspiratuvar isofluran ) values were lower in Group N at minute @ and @ ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	By using dexmedetomidine instead of nitrous oxide in low flow isoflurane anesthesia , we attained desired MAP levels , sufficient anesthesia depth , hemodynamic stability and safe inspiration parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	Dexmedetomidine infusion with medical air-oxygen as a carrier gas represents an alternative anesthetic technique .

OBJECTIVE	To examine whether self-efficacy mediated the effect of the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation program on activity limitations in older adults after hip fracture and whether the mediating effect was different between sex and age groups .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Community .
METHODS	Participants with hip fracture ( N = @ ; mean age SD , @ y ) were randomly assigned to intervention ( n = @ , @ % ) and attention control ( n = @ , @ % ) groups .
METHODS	The @-month intervention , the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation , is a functionally oriented , home-based exercise program .
METHODS	Data were collected at baseline , postintervention ( @mo ) , and follow-up ( @mo ) .
METHODS	Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care .
RESULTS	The mediating effect of the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation program on Basic Mobility function through self-efficacy for exercise was significant at @ months ( indirect = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , the mediating effect of the intervention on Daily Activity function through self-efficacy for exercise was significant at @ months ( indirect = @ ) .
RESULTS	In subgroup analyses , the mediating effect was significant at @ months in the younger group ( age , @y ) in comparison to the older group and was significant in women in comparison to men .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-efficacy may play a partial mediating role in the effect on some longer-term functional outcomes in the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that program components that target self-efficacy should be incorporated in future hip fracture rehabilitation interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Age and sex of the targeted participants may also need to be considered when developing interventions .

OBJECTIVE	Albinterferon is a fusion of albumin and interferon-@b developed to improve the pharmacokinetics , convenience , and potential efficacy of interferon - for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections .
METHODS	This open-label , randomized , active-controlled , multicenter study investigated the safety and efficacy of albinterferon in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection who were e-antigen ( HBeAg ) positive .
METHODS	One hundred and forty-one patients received one of four albinterferon doses/regimens or pegylated-interferon-@a .
METHODS	Primary efficacy outcomes were changes in serum HBeAg and antibody , HBV-DNA , and alanine aminotransferase .
METHODS	Principal safety outcomes were changes in laboratory values , pulmonary function , and adverse events .
RESULTS	The study was prematurely terminated as phase III trials in hepatitis C infection indicated noninferior efficacy but inferior safety compared with pegylated-interferon-@a .
RESULTS	Here , all treatment groups had a significant reduction in HBV-DNA from baseline .
RESULTS	Reductions in HBV-DNA were not significantly different , except the @g every @ weeks albinterferon dose which was inferior compared with pegylated-interferon-@a .
RESULTS	The serum alanine aminotransferase levels decreased in all arms .
RESULTS	The per-patient incidence of adverse events was not significantly different for albinterferon ( @-@ % ) and pegylated-interferon-@a ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Total adverse events , however , were higher for albinterferon and correlated to dose .
RESULTS	Decreased lung function was found in all arms ( @ % of patients ) , and was more common in some albinterferon groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Albinterferon doses with similar anti-HBV efficacy to pegylated-interferon-@a had higher rates of certain adverse events , particularly changes in lung diffusion capacity ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov number NCT@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	A randomized controlled trial was carried out to study the effect of a recently proposed technique of ex vivo intra-arterial methylene blue injection of the surgical specimen removed for colorectal cancer on lymph node harvest and staging .
METHODS	Between May @ and February @ , @ consecutive colorectal cancer resection specimens in a single institution were randomly assigned to intervention ( methylene blue injection ) and control ( standard manual palpation technique ) groups before formalin fixation .
METHODS	The specimen was then examined by the histopathologist for lymph nodes .
RESULTS	Both groups were similar for age , sex , site of tumour , operation and tumour stage .
RESULTS	In the intervention group , a higher number of nodes was found -LSB- median @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) , P < @ -RSB- , with only one specimen not achieving the recommended minimum standard of @ nodes -LSB- @/@ ( @ % ) vs. @/@ ( @ % ) , P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	However , there was no upstaging effect in the intervention group -LSB- @/@ ( @ % ) vs. @/@ ( @ % ) ; P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	With a significantly lower number of nodes harvested in rectal cancer , the positive effect of the intervention was particularly observed in the patients who underwent preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy -LSB- median @ nodes ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) ; P = @ ; proportion of cases with < @ nodes @/@ vs. @/@ ( @ % ) , P = @ -RSB- .
CONCLUSIONS	Ex vivo intra-arterial methylene blue injection increases lymph node yield and can help to reduce the number of cases with a lower-than-recommended number of nodes , particularly in patients with rectal cancer having neoadjuvant treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The technique is easy to perform , cheap and saves time .

BACKGROUND	Spinal anesthesia was considered as a reasonable anesthetic option in severe preeclampsia when cesarean delivery is indicated , and there is no indwelling epidural catheter or contraindication to spinal anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	However , the ideal dose of intrathecal bupivacaine has not been quantified for cesarean delivery for severe preeclamptic patients .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to determine the ED @ and ED @ of intrathecal bupivacaine for severely preeclamptic patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery .
METHODS	Two hundred severely preeclamptic patients are undergoing elective cesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia enrolled in this randomized , double-blinded , dose-ranging study .
METHODS	Patients received @ mg , @ mg , @ mg , or @ mg intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine with @ g sufentanil .
METHODS	Successful spinal anesthesia was defined as a T@ sensory level achieved within @ minutes after intrathecal drug administration and/or no epidural supplement was required during the cesarean section .
METHODS	The ED @ and ED @ were calculated with a logistic regression model .
RESULTS	ED @ and ED @ of intrathecal bupivacaine for successful spinal anesthesia were @ mg ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ mg ) and @ mg ( @ % CI : @-@ @ mg ) respectively .
RESULTS	The incidence of hypotension in Group @ mg and Group @ mg was higher than that in Group @ mg and Group @ mg ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The sensory block was significantly different among groups @ minutes after intrathecal injection ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The use of lidocaine in Group @ mg was higher than that in other groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The use of phenylephrine in Group @ mg and Group @ mg was higher than that in the other two groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The lowest systolic blood pressure before the infant delivery of Group @ mg and Group @ mg was lower than the other two groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The satisfaction of muscle relaxation in Group @ mg was lower than other groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in patients ' satisfaction and the newborns ' Apgar score and the blood gas analysis of umbilical artery serum ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study showed that the ED @ and ED @ of intrathecal bupivacaine for severely preeclamptic patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery were @ mg and @ mg , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , decreasing the dose of intrathecal bupivacaine could reduce the incidence of maternal hypotension .

BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that statin use in individuals with COPD is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations .
METHODS	We identified @ individuals with COPD and a measurement of C reactive protein ( CRP ) in the Copenhagen General Population Study ( @-@ ) .
METHODS	During @years of follow-up we recorded exacerbations with hospital admissions or oral corticosteroid treatment .
METHODS	In a nested case-control design , matching on age , gender , smoking , COPD severity and comorbidity , we estimated the association between statin use and exacerbations .
METHODS	In addition , we examined the association between statin use and high CRP ( > @mg/L ) , and the association between high CRP and exacerbations during follow-up .
RESULTS	Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in crude analysis , OR = @ ( @ % CI @ to @ , p = @ ) , as well as in multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis , OR = @ ( @ to @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , in the subgroup with the most severe COPD and without cardiovascular comorbidity , we observed a null association between statin use and exacerbations , OR = @ ( @ to @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , statin use was associated with reduced odds of a high CRP , OR = @ ( @ to @ , p < @ ) , and a high CRP was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations , HR = @ ( @ to @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	We estimated the percentage of excess risk of the association of statin use with exacerbations possibly mediated through a reduction of CRP to be @ % ( @-@ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in individuals with COPD from the general population , although this was not apparent in those with the most severe COPD without cardiovascular comorbidity .
CONCLUSIONS	Statins may thus only associate with reduced risk of exacerbations in patients with COPD with coexisting cardiovascular disease .

BACKGROUND	Research on the use of a pressurized metered dose inhaler ( pMDI ) with spacer ( pMDI/spacer ) in children has indicated oral inhalation via the spacer mouthpiece is more efficient than the combination of oral and nasal inhalation that occurs when a pMDI/spacer is used with a facemask .
BACKGROUND	Changes in pMDI formulations and developments in spacer and facemask designs have highlighted the need for new comparative studies of spacer use , particularly focusing on the age at which children can be taught to transition from use of a pMDI/spacer with facemask to use of the spacer mouthpiece .
METHODS	Twelve children aged @-@ years ( @ males ) with stable asthma were recruited .
METHODS	Of these , @ children ( @ males ) completed both arms of the study .
METHODS	A transmission scan of each compliant subject was taken using a @ MBq ( @m ) Tc flood source .
METHODS	Actuations ( @-@ ) of a ( @m ) Tc-radiolabeled albuterol pMDI were administered through an antistatic spacer ( OptiChamber Diamond ) via either a facemask ( medium LiteTouch facemask ) , or the spacer mouthpiece .
METHODS	The subject 's inhalation pattern was simultaneously recorded using a pMDI Datalogger , and narrative data relating to tolerance and compliance were documented .
METHODS	Anterior and posterior planar scintigraphic scans were taken immediately after aerosol administration .
RESULTS	Mean ( SD ) lung deposition ( % total dose ) was @ ( @ ) % with the facemask and @ ( @ ) % with the spacer mouthpiece ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Peripheral lung deposition ( expressed as peripheral : central ( P : C ) ratio ) was higher in @ out of @ children with the facemask compared with the spacer mouthpiece : @ ( @ ) vs. @ ( @ ) ; ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Head and neck deposition was higher with use of the facemask compared with the spacer mouthpiece : @ ( @ ) % vs. @ ( @ ) % ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Lung deposition achieved using the spacer with facemask was higher than previously reported , with a difference of only @ % of total dose measured compared to the deposition with mouthpiece .
CONCLUSIONS	This may be due to a combination of factors including pMDI formulation , and use of an antistatic spacer with a flexible , well-fitting facemask .

BACKGROUND	There is a shortage of literature describing the experience of individuals who have participated in a physical activity and mobile health ( mHealth ) intervention .
BACKGROUND	Many physical activity interventions are of short duration and do not report long-term changes in clinical measures or adoption of prescribed health behaviors .
BACKGROUND	Previously , we have reported the clinical and behavioral outcomes from the first phase of a physical activity prescription and mHealth intervention delivered through the primary care setting .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this next phase is to perform a longitudinal follow-up @-months postintervention .
METHODS	Mixed methods analysis including repeated measures ANOVA of functional aerobic capacity ( VO@max ) at preintervention , postintervention , and follow-up clinic visits , and whole text analysis of semistructured interviews discussing the participant experience in a health behavior intervention .
RESULTS	Twenty participants , mean age @ @ years , participated .
RESULTS	Gains made in VO@max were maintained at @ months ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Participants reported engaging in sustained and routine physical activity , yet some identified a need for additional support to adopt the prescribed health behaviors .
RESULTS	Emergent themes included the desire for short-term mHealth intervention to educate individuals about prescribed health behaviors without need for ongoing management by clinicians , leveraging mHealth to build social networks around prescribed health behaviors and to connect individuals to build a sense of community , and participant views of physical activity as medicine .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study investigated both the long-term adoption of physical activity behaviors as well as the participant experience in a physical activity and mHealth intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings from the current study may be used to inform the development of user-centered lifestyle interventions .

BACKGROUND	This study was designed to analyze and compare plasma levels of @-isoprostane ( @-epiPGF@ ) , a biomarker of lipid peroxidation , and uric acid ( UA ) , a marker of the antioxidant status , in standard laparoscopic ( LC ) and laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy ( LSSC ) .
METHODS	Forty patients with noncomplicated cholelithiasis were randomized to undergo either LSSC ( n = @ ) or LC ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The patients had body mass index < @ , American Society of Anesthesiologists score I or II , and no previous upper gastrointestinal surgery .
METHODS	Blood samples were taken preoperatively and @ h and @ h postoperatively .
METHODS	Levels of @-epiPGF@ were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , whereas levels of UA were calculated using automated analyzer .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in operative data among the groups .
RESULTS	Levels of @-epiPGF@ were significantly higher in LSSC compared with LC at @ h ( P = @ ) and @ h ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	@-epiPGF@ levels showed significant changes over time in LC ( LSSC : P = @ , LC : P < @ ) .
RESULTS	UA levels were significantly higher in LC compared with LSSC , @ h postoperatively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant changes over time in the UA levels in both groups ( LSSC : P = @ , LC : P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	LSSC is associated with increased oxidative stress compared with LC .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to confirm these results .

OBJECTIVE	Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation can result in oesophageal injuries that lead to atrio-oesophageal fistulae , a life-threatening complication .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to evaluate whether oesophageal cooling could prevent oesophageal lesions complicating AF ablation .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned @ patients with drug-resistant AF to an oesophageal cooling group or a control group .
RESULTS	In the oesophageal cooling group , we injected @ mL of ice water into the oesophagus prior to radiofrequency ( RF ) energy delivery adjacent to the oesophagus .
RESULTS	If the oesophageal temperature reached @C , the RF energy delivery was stopped , and the ice water injection was repeated .
RESULTS	In the control group , oesophageal cooling was not applied .
RESULTS	Oesophageal endoscopy was performed @ day after the catheter ablation , and lesions were qualitatively assessed as mild , moderate , or severe .
RESULTS	The numbers of ablation sites with an oesophageal temperature of > @C were @ @ and @ @ in the oesophageal cooling group and the control group , respectively ( P = @ ) , and the maximal oesophageal temperature at those sites was @ @ and @ @ C ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Oesophageal lesions occurred almost equally between the oesophageal cooling group -LSB- @ of @ patients ( @ % ) -RSB- and the control group -LSB- @ of @ patients ( @ % ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	However , the severity of the oesophageal lesions was slightly milder in the oesophageal cooling group ( three moderate , seven mild ) than in the control group ( three severe , one moderate , seven mild ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Oesophageal cooling may alleviate the severity of oesophageal lesions but does not reduce the incidence of this complication under the specific protocol evaluated here .

BACKGROUND	Like other acute and chronic infections , Brucella infection leads to endothelial dysfunction .
BACKGROUND	Furthermore , it has been suggested that the chronic inflammatory state present in chronic infectious diseases leads to an acceleration in atherosclerosis .
BACKGROUND	For the prediction of CAD , it is possible to use epicardial fat thickness ( EFT ) as an adjunctive marker beside the classical risk factors , as it is easily and non-invasively evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of impaired myocardial performance as well as of increased arterial stiffness and EFT in patients who had been infected with brucellosis in the past .
METHODS	Included in the study were twenty-seven brucellosis patients and twenty-six healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Using EFT and transthoracic echocardiography , which included Doppler echocardiography in combination with tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) , all the patients were examined to measure their aortic stiffness index ( AoSI ) , aortic distensibility ( AoD ) , and aortic elastic modulus ( AoEM ) values .
RESULTS	A statistically significant increase was observed in hs-CRP , aortic stiffness index , aortic elastic modulus and EFT in brucellosis patients when compared with the controls ( @ + / - @ vs. @ ?
RESULTS	@ , P = @ ; @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ , P < @ ; @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ , P < @ ; @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	On the other hand , there was a significant decrease in aortic strain and aortic distensibility ( @ ?
RESULTS	@ vs @ + / - @ , P < @ ; @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ , P < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	No difference was observed between the two groups with respect to the left ventricular myocardial performance index ( MPI ) ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , we demonstrated for the first time in the literature thatthere was impaired aortic elasticity and increased EFT in patients with brucellosis , while the myocardial performance index remained unaffected .
CONCLUSIONS	We also determined that these effects had a significant correlation with inflammation .

BACKGROUND	Breast cancer survivors experience long-term physical and psychological sequelae after their primary treatment that negatively influence their quality of life ( QOL ) and increase depressive symptoms .
BACKGROUND	Group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management ( CBSM ) delivered after surgery for early-stage breast cancer was previously associated with better QOL over a @-month follow-up and with fewer depressive symptoms up to @ years after study enrollment .
BACKGROUND	This @ - to @-year follow-up ( median , @ years ) of a previously conducted trial ( NCT@ ) evaluated whether women in this cohort receiving CBSM had fewer depressive symptoms and better QOL than controls at an @ - to @-year follow-up .
METHODS	Women with stage @ to IIIb breast cancer were initially recruited @ to @ weeks after surgery and randomized to a @-week CBSM intervention or a @-day psychoeducational control group .
METHODS	One hundred women ( @ CBSM patients and @ controls ) were recontacted @ to @ years after study enrollment to participate in a follow-up assessment .
METHODS	The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression ( CES-D ) scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast ( FACT-B ) were self-administered .
METHODS	Multiple regression was employed to evaluate group differences on the CES-D scale and FACT-B over and above effects of confounding variables .
RESULTS	Participants assigned to CBSM reported significantly lower depressive symptoms ( d , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ) and better QOL ( d , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) above the effects of the covariates .
CONCLUSIONS	Women who received CBSM after surgery for early-stage breast cancer reported lower depressive symptoms and better QOL than the control group up to @ years later .
CONCLUSIONS	Early implementation of cognitive-behavioral interventions may influence long-term psychosocial functioning in breast cancer survivors .

OBJECTIVE	Youth in high-poverty neighborhoods have high rates of emotional problems .
OBJECTIVE	Understanding neighborhood influences on mental health is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions .
OBJECTIVE	To perform an exploratory analysis of associations between housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence .
METHODS	The Moving to Opportunity Demonstration from @ to @ randomized @ volunteer public housing families with @ children in high-poverty neighborhoods into @ of @ housing mobility intervention groups ( a low-poverty voucher group vs a traditional voucher group ) or a control group .
METHODS	The low-poverty voucher group ( n = @ ) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods with enhanced mobility counseling .
METHODS	The traditional voucher group ( n = @ ) received geographically unrestricted vouchers .
METHODS	Controls ( n = @ ) received no intervention .
METHODS	Follow-up evaluation was performed @ to @ years later ( June @-April @ ) with participants aged @ to @ years ( @-@ years at randomization ) .
METHODS	Response rates were @ % to @ % .
METHODS	Presence of mental disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( Fourth Edition ) within the past @ months , including major depressive disorder , panic disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , oppositional-defiant disorder , intermittent explosive disorder , and conduct disorder , as assessed post hoc with a validated diagnostic interview .
RESULTS	Of the @ adolescents randomized , @ were interviewed ( @ boys and @ girls ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the control group , boys in the low-poverty voucher group had significantly increased rates of major depression ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio ( OR ) , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) , PTSD ( @ % vs @ % ; OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) , and conduct disorder ( @ % vs @ % ; OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Boys in the traditional voucher group had increased rates of PTSD compared with the control group ( @ % vs @ % , OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	However , compared with the control group , girls in the traditional voucher group had decreased rates of major depression ( @ % vs @ % ; OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) and conduct disorder ( @ % vs @ % ; OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Interventions to encourage moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with increased rates of depression , PTSD , and conduct disorder among boys and reduced rates of depression and conduct disorder among girls .
CONCLUSIONS	Better understanding of interactions among individual , family , and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes .

BACKGROUND	Peak internal knee abduction moment is a common surrogate variable associated with medial compartment knee loading .
BACKGROUND	Stair descent has been shown to yield a greater peak knee abduction moment compared to level-walking .
BACKGROUND	Changes in step width ( SW ) may lead to changes in frontal plane lower extremity limb alignment in the frontal plane and alter peak knee abduction moment .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of increased SW on frontal plane knee biomechanics during stair descent in healthy older adults .
METHODS	Twenty healthy adults were recruited for the study .
METHODS	A motion analysis system was used to obtain three-dimensional lower limb kinematics during testing .
METHODS	An instrumented @-step staircase with two additional customized wooden steps was used to collect ground reaction forces ( GRF ) data during stair descent trials .
METHODS	Participants performed five stair descent trials at their self-selected speed using preferred , wide ( @ % leg length ) , and wider ( @ % leg length ) SW .
RESULTS	The preferred normalized SW in older adults during stair descent was @ % of leg length .
RESULTS	Wide and wider SW during stair descent reduced both first and second peak knee adduction angles and abduction moments compared to preferred SW in healthy adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased SW reduced peak knee adduction angles and abduction moments .
CONCLUSIONS	The reductions in knee abduction moments may have implications in reducing medial compartment knee loads during stair descent .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the prognostic importance of transient or persistent elevations of cardiac troponin-I ( cTnI ) and N-terminal-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) in atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .
METHODS	Plasma samples were obtained at randomisation and after @ months in @ patients with AF in the RE-LY trial ; median follow-up was @ years .
METHODS	Patients were grouped based on levels at the two time points according to detectable cTnI levels ( @ g/L ) or NT-proBNP levels above median ( @ ng/L ) .
METHODS	These groups were related to occurrence of stroke or cardiovascular events evaluated with Cox models adjusting for established risk factors .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with detectable cTnI levels at both time points was @ % , at one time point @ % and at neither time point @ % .
RESULTS	Patients with detectable cTnI at both time points had substantially higher rates of stroke compared with those with transient elevations and those with no elevation at either time point ( p < @ , effect of cTnI ) .
RESULTS	Persistent elevation of either or both cardiac biomarkers at baseline and @ months was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events and mortality ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Prognostic prediction improved most with the use of repeated measurements of both cardiac biomarkers simultaneously ( p < @ ) and achieved C-statistic @ for stroke compared with @ for CHADS@-score .
CONCLUSIONS	Persistent elevation of troponin and NT-proBNP indicates a worse prognosis than transient elevations or no elevations of either marker .
CONCLUSIONS	Prognostication of stroke , death and thromboembolic events is improved by the use of repeated determinations of cardiac biomarkers .

BACKGROUND	Although reperfusion injury has been shown to be responsible for cardiomyocytes death after an acute myocardial infarction , there is currently no drug on the market that reduces this type of injury .
BACKGROUND	TRO@ is a new cardioprotective compound that was shown to inhibit the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion in a rat model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury .
METHODS	In the rat model , the therapeutic window and the dose effect relationship were investigated in order to select the proper dose and design for clinical investigations .
METHODS	To evaluate post-ischemic functional recovery , TRO@ was tested in a model of isolated rat heart .
METHODS	Additionally , TRO@ was investigated in a Phase I randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled study to assess the safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous ascending doses of the compound ( @ to @ mg/kg ) in @ healthy male , post-menopausal and hysterectomized female subjects at flow rates from @ to @ mL/min ( EudraCT number : @-@-@ ) .
METHODS	This work was supported in part by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche .
RESULTS	In the vivo model , TRO@ reduced infarct size by @ % at @ mg/kg and by @ % at @ and @ mg/kg given by intravenous bolus and was only active when administered before reperfusion .
RESULTS	Additionally , TRO@ provided functional recovery and reduced oxidative stress in the isolated rat heart model.These results , together with pharmacokinetic based allometry to human and non-clinical toxicology data , were used to design the Phase I trial .
RESULTS	All the tested doses and flow rates were well tolerated clinically .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events reported .
RESULTS	No relevant changes in vital signs , electrocardiogram parameters , laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed at any time in any dose group .
RESULTS	Pharmacokinetics was linear up to @ mg/kg and slightly ~ @-fold , hyper-proportional from @ to @ mg/kg .
CONCLUSIONS	These data demonstrated that TRO@ can be safely administered by the intravenous route in humans at doses expected to be pharmacologically active .
CONCLUSIONS	These results allowed evaluating the expected active dose in human at @ mg/kg , used in a Phase II proof-of-concept study currently ongoing .

BACKGROUND	AST-@ ( spherical carbon adsorbent ) was previously reported to be effective for perianal fistula healing in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate Crohn 's disease .
METHODS	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AST-@ in a Western population , a phase @ , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , study ( FHAST-@ ) was conducted in adult patients with at least @ draining perianal fistula and a Crohn 's disease activity index < @ .
METHODS	Patients received either AST-@ or matching placebo at a dose of @ g @ times daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment success , defined as a @ % reduction in the number of draining fistulae , at both weeks @ and @ .
METHODS	A multivariate model was generated to assess covariates for treatment success among baseline variables .
RESULTS	Two hundred forty-nine patients were randomized ( AST-@ ; n = @ ; placebo , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The proportions of patients achieving the primary endpoint were no different between treatment groups ( @ % versus @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences in fistula response were noted at week @ ( @ % versus @ % , P = @ ) or week @ ( @ versus @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum C-reactive protein concentrations > @ mg/dL and Crohn 's disease activity index scores > @ at baseline were associated with a reduced likelihood of treatment success ( odds ratio , @ ; confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ; and odds ratio , @ ; confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this largest placebo-controlled trial to date to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic agent on perianal fistulae in Crohn 's disease , the efficacy of AST-@ could not be confirmed .
CONCLUSIONS	An inverse relationship was observed between both inflammatory and clinical disease activity and fistula response .

OBJECTIVE	This study aimed at comparing the development of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation between the right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT ) and right ventricular apex ( RVA ) pacing .
METHODS	We prospectively enrolled @ patients for permanent pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block and randomly divided them into two equal groups to receive either RVOT or RVA pacing .
METHODS	Patients with heart failure or valvular disease were excluded .
METHODS	The post-procedural echocardiographic evaluations were performed @year after the pre-procedural echocardiography , and the results were compared with respect to the development of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and probable changes in the ejection fraction ( EF ) .
RESULTS	Age , gender , pacing mode , and baseline cardiac rhythm did not significantly differ between the RVOT and RVA pacing groups .
RESULTS	The incidence of mitral regurgitation was significantly higher in the RVA group ( p = @ ) , but the incidence of tricuspid regurgitation was similar in both groups .
RESULTS	There was a trend toward less tricuspid regurgitation in the RVOT group ; however , it was not statistically significant .
RESULTS	The mean EF was not significantly different between the study groups .
CONCLUSIONS	It seems that the incidence of mitral regurgitation in RVA pacing is significantly higher than that in RVOT pacing .
CONCLUSIONS	The formation of tricuspid regurgitation needs to be discussed in the future .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the impact of using paclitaxel-coated balloons ( PCB ) on outcome after post-angioplasty dissection in femoropopliteal arteries .
METHODS	The angiograms obtained in the THUNDER study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT@ ) were analyzed to compare degrees of dissection and angiographic parameters between the control ( uncoated balloons , n = @ ) and treatment ( PCBs , n = @ ) groups before and after the intervention and at @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Furthermore , target lesion revascularizations ( TLR ) were documented up to @ years .
RESULTS	In each group , @ ( @ % ) patients had a dissection after the intervention .
RESULTS	At the @-month follow-up , patients with dissection of any grade after treatment with PCBs had significantly less late lumen loss ( @ mm ) than patients with dissection after treatment with uncoated balloons ( @ mm , p = @ ) and a lower degree of stenosis ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with severe dissection ( grades C , D , or E ) especially seemed to benefit from the PCBs , with late lumen loss of @ mm vs. @ mm for controls ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The binary restenosis rate was also markedly lower in the PCB group ( @ % ) than in the uncoated group ( @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the @-year follow-up , TLR was performed in @ % of patients in the control group compared to @ % of patients in the PCB group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this subgroup analysis suggest that patients with dissection following treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon have a very acceptable outcome and stent implantation is not necessary as long as the dissection does not result in acute flow limitation .

OBJECTIVE	To examine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) would enhance attenuated amplitudes of event-related potentials ( ERPs ) indexing performance monitoring biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
METHODS	Fifty adult ADHD patients took part in a randomised controlled study investigating ERP and clinical measures pre-to-post MBCT .
METHODS	Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to MBCT , @ to a wait-list control .
METHODS	Main outcome measures included error processing ( ERN , Pe ) , conflict monitoring ( NoGo-N@ ) , and inhibitory control ( NoGo-P@ ) ERPs concomitant to a continuous performance task ( CPT-X ) .
METHODS	Inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD symptoms , psychological distress and social functioning , and mindfulness skills were also assessed .
RESULTS	MBCT was associated with increased Pe and NoGo-P@ amplitudes , coinciding with reduced ` hyperactivity/impulsivity ' and ` inattention ' symptomatology .
RESULTS	Specific to the MBCT ; enhanced Pe amplitudes correlated with a decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and increased ` act-with-awareness ' mindfulness skill , whereas , enhanced P@ correlated with amelioration in inattention symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	MBCT enhanced ERP amplitudes associated with motivational saliency and error awareness , leading to improved inhibitory regulation .
CONCLUSIONS	MBCT suggests having comparable modulation on performance monitoring ERP amplitudes as pharmacological treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study and development of MBCT as a treatment for ADHD is warranted , in addition to its potential scope for clinical applicability to broader defined externalising disorders and clinical problems associated with impairments of the prefrontal cortex .

METHODS	Bosentan was applied within @ days after Fontan surgery as follows : at the first month , @ mg Bid for patients with body weight @ kg ; @ mg Bid for patients with body weight between @-@ kg ; @ mg Bid for patients with body weight @-@ kg and @ mg Bid for patients with body weight > @ kg .
METHODS	At the second month , the bosentan dose was doubled and Bosentan therapy was continued for more than @ year .
METHODS	Group C did n't take drugs affecting pulmonary artery pressure .
METHODS	All patients were followed up for @ years and incidence of mortality , protein losing enteropathy , pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae , @-minute walk test , heart function were compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	After @ years , mortality tended to be lower in group B compared to group C -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) vs. @ % ( @/@ ) , P > @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae and protein losing enteropathy were significantly lower in group B than in group C ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ; @ % vs. @ % , P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The results of @-minute walk test -LSB- ( @ @ ) m vs. ( @ @ ) m -RSB- and heart function in group B ( @ NYHA III/IV patients in group B vs. @ NYHA III/IV patients in group C , all P < @ ) were all better than group C.
RESULTS	The concentrations of vasoactive factors such as brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP , @ @ vs. @ @ ) , endothelin ( ET , @ @ vs. @ @ ) and thromboxane ( TXA@ , @ @ vs. @ @ ) were also significantly lower in group B than in group C ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Prostacyclin ( PGI@ ) level and incidence of arrhythmias were similar between the two groups .
RESULTS	There was no thrombotic event in both groups during follow up .
CONCLUSIONS	Bosentan trerapy in patients post Fontan operation could reduce the incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae and protein losing enteropathy and improve heart function .

BACKGROUND	In schizophrenia , the presence of certain cognitive biases has been established .
BACKGROUND	Informed by this , metacognitive training ( MCT ) has been developed for schizophrenia .
BACKGROUND	There is increasing evidence of its effectiveness with some patients , but its applicability to dangerous patients has not yet been demonstrated .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) of MCT for patients in a high-security hospital setting .
METHODS	Twenty of @ eligible and selected male in-patients with schizophrenia and a history of violence were randomised pairwise to eight sessions of MCT or treatment as usual .
METHODS	Symptom severity and reasoning , according to the jumping to conclusions paradigm , were measured before , immediately after treatment , and @ and @months later .
RESULTS	Men in both groups completed the trial , and those in the MCT arm , almost all of the group sessions .
RESULTS	The MCT arm had a significant advantage in improvement of ` suspiciousness ' , greatest at @months , but then declining .
RESULTS	No significant improvement in reasoning ability was achieved .
CONCLUSIONS	Metacognitive training showed sufficient promise in this group for a full trial to be worthwhile , and the feasibility of an RCT methodology , even in a secure hospital , was established .
CONCLUSIONS	The fact that the improvements faded during follow-up suggests that a useful modification to the treatment would be lengthening the protocol , repeating it , or both .

BACKGROUND	We evaluated week-on/week-off axitinib dosing plus chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal tumours , including tumour thymidine uptake by fluorine-@ @ ' - deoxy-@ ' - fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ( ( @ ) FLT-PET ) .
METHODS	During a lead-in period , patients received twice daily ( b.i.d. ) axitinib @ mg ( n = @ ) or @ mg ( n = @ ) for @ days followed by a @-day dosing interruption ; serial ( @ ) FLT-PET scans were performed before day @ and on days @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	Axitinib plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX was then administered in @-week cycles ; axitinib was interrupted on day @ of each cycle for @ days .
RESULTS	The maximum tolerated dose of axitinib was @ mg b.i.d. , in a week-on/week-off schedule , combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX .
RESULTS	Common all-causality grade @ adverse events were neutropenia ( @ % ) , hypertension ( @ % ) , and fatigue ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Of @ patients , @ ( @ % ) had a partial response and @ ( @ % ) had stable disease .
RESULTS	Following @ days of continuous axitinib dosing , tumour ( @ ) FLT uptake decreased -@ % from baseline and recovered to -@ % and -@ % from baseline , respectively , after @ and @ days of axitinib interruption .
CONCLUSIONS	Axitinib administered in a week-on/week-off schedule combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX is supported by ( @ ) FLT-PET data and was well tolerated in patients with gastrointestinal tumours .

BACKGROUND	Classification schemas for low back pain ( LBP ) , such as the Treatment-Based Classification and the Movement System Impairment , use common clinical features to subgroup patients with LBP and are purported to improve treatment outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	To assess if providing matched treatments based on patient-specific clinical features led to superior treatment outcomes compared with an unmatched treatment for subjects with chronic recurrent LBP .
METHODS	This study is a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Subjects ( n = @ ) with LBP ( @ months ) with or without recurrences underwent a standardized clinical examination to group them into one of two strata : ineligible or eligible for stabilization exercises based on the Treatment-Based Classification schema .
METHODS	Subjects underwent additional clinical tests to assign them to one of the five possible Movement System Impairment categories .
METHODS	Questionnaires were collected electronically at Week @ ( before treatment ) , Week @ ( after the @-week @-hour treatment sessions ) , and @ months .
METHODS	Using the Oswestry disability index ( @-@ ) and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( @-@ ) , the primary analysis was performed using the intention-to-treat principle .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included fear-avoidance beliefs and psychosocial work-related and general health status .
METHODS	After subjects were categorized based on their particular clinical features using both the Treatment-Based Classification and Movement System Impairment schemas , they were randomized into one of two treatments using a @:@ ratio for matched or unmatched treatments .
METHODS	The treatments were trunk stabilization exercise or Movement System Impairment-directed exercises .
RESULTS	Of the patients allocated to treatment for this study , @ received a matched treatment and @ received an unmatched treatment .
RESULTS	After treatment , both groups showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome measures and almost all the secondary measures ; however , the matched treatment group did not demonstrate superior outcomes at Week @ or @ months , except on one of the secondary measures ( Graded Chronic Pain Scale -LSB- Disability Scale -RSB- ) ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing a matched treatment based on either the Treatment-Based Classification or the Movement System Impairment classification schema did not improve treatment outcomes compared with an unmatched treatment for patients with chronic LBP , except on one secondary disability measure .

BACKGROUND	Wound infiltration at the end of carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthesia is a simple technique that can be delegated to the surgeon .
BACKGROUND	It was hypothesised that this technique could improve early post-operative analgesia by reducing the need for post-operative opioids .
METHODS	Forty patients underwent carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthesia with desflurane and remifentanil supplemented with morphine for post-operative analgesia .
METHODS	In a prospective double-blinded randomised study , patients were allocated pre-operatively to receive either subcutaneous infiltration of both wound edges with @ ml of @ % ropivacaine or infiltration with isotonic saline .
METHODS	The primary outcome was morphine consumption while in the post-anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .
METHODS	Pain scores at rest and movement , sedation , and patient satisfaction were the other main outcomes used to assess post-operative analgesia .
RESULTS	The median dose of morphine administered in the PACU was @ mg -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the ropivacaine vs. @ mg -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the placebo group ( P = @ , Mann-Whitney 's test ) .
RESULTS	Pain at rest and at movement was lower in the ropivacaine group throughout observation in the PACU .
RESULTS	No difference was found for both pain and opioid consumption after discharge from the PACU or for patient satisfaction .
RESULTS	Sedative events in the early post-operative period were less frequent in the ropivacaine group .
CONCLUSIONS	Local anaesthetic wound infiltration performed before closure reduces the need for additional opioids , lowers the immediate post-operative pain and improves alertness .
CONCLUSIONS	These results argue for the use of local infiltration anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy .

BACKGROUND	Venous thromboembolism is common in patients with cancer and requires anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin .
BACKGROUND	Current data informs anticoagulation as far as six months , yet guidelines recommend anticoagulation beyond six months in patients who have locally advanced or metastatic cancer .
BACKGROUND	This recommendation , based on expert consensus , has not been evaluated in a clinical study .
BACKGROUND	ALICAT ( Anticoagulation Length in Cancer Associated Thrombosis ) is a feasibility study to identify the most clinically and cost effective length of anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin in the treatment of cancer associated thrombosis .
METHODS	ALICAT is a randomized multi-centre phase two mixed-methods study with three components : a randomized controlled trial , embedded qualitative study and a survey investigating pathways of care .
METHODS	The randomized controlled trial will compare ongoing low molecular weight heparin treatment for cancer-associated thrombosis versus cessation of low molecular weight heparin at six months treatment ( current licensed practice ) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer .
METHODS	The embedded qualitative study will include focus groups with clinicians to investigate attitudes to recruiting to the study , identify the challenges of progressing to a full randomized controlled trial , and also semi-structured interviews with patients and relatives/carers to explore their attitudes towards participating in the study and potential barriers and concerns to participation .
METHODS	Finally , a UK wide survey exercise will be undertaken to develop a classification and enumeration system for the cancer associated thrombosis models and pathways of care .
CONCLUSIONS	There is a lack of evidence determining the length of anticoagulation for patients with cancer associated thrombosis and subsequently treatment length varies .
CONCLUSIONS	The ALICAT study will consider the feasibility of recruiting patients to a phase three trial .

BACKGROUND	For women with hormone receptor-positive , operable breast cancer , surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen is an effective adjuvant therapy .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a phase III randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that oophorectomy surgery performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was associated with better outcomes .
METHODS	Seven hundred forty premenopausal women entered a clinical trial in which those women estimated not to be in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle for the next one to six days ( n = @ ) were randomly assigned to receive treatment with surgical oophorectomy either delayed to be during a five-day window in the history-estimated midluteal phase of the menstrual cycles , or in the next one to six days .
METHODS	Women who were estimated to be in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for the next one to six days ( n = @ ) were excluded from random assignment and received immediate surgical treatments .
METHODS	All patients began tamoxifen within @ days of surgery and continued this for @ years .
METHODS	Kaplan-Meier methods , the log-rank test , and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess differences in five-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) between the groups .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	The randomized midluteal phase surgery group had a five-year DFS of @ % , compared with @ % for the immediate surgery random assignment group ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable Cox regression models , which included important prognostic variables , gave similar results ( aHR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For overall survival , the univariate hazard ratio was @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ , P = @ ) and the multivariable aHR was @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Better DFS for follicular phase surgery , which was unanticipated , proved consistent across multiple exploratory analyses .
CONCLUSIONS	The hypothesized benefit of adjuvant luteal phase oophorectomy was not shown in this large trial .

###24239662
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to investigate the differential efficacy of clopidogrel or aspirin monotherapy according to smoking status in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease .
BACKGROUND	Smoking enhances clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition , which may explain the higher relative benefit among smokers observed in trials evaluating dual antiplatelet therapy .
BACKGROUND	Whether smoking has an impact on clinical outcomes in patients requiring a single antiplatelet agent remains unknown .
METHODS	This was a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE ( Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events ) trial that compared clopidogrel and aspirin monotherapy in patients ( N = @,@ ) with atherosclerotic vascular disease .
RESULTS	Current smokers ( n = @,@ ) had an increased risk of ischemic events compared with never smokers ( n = @,@ ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ to @ -RSB- ) and ex-smokers ( n = @,@ ; HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @ to @ -RSB- ) ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Clopidogrel was associated with a reduction in ischemic events among current smokers ( @ % vs. @ % ; HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @ to @ -RSB- ) , whereas no benefit over aspirin was seen in the combined group of ex-smokers/never-smoked patients ( @ % vs. @ % ; HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @ to @ -RSB- ; p = @ for interaction ) .
RESULTS	Among current smokers , clopidogrel also reduced myocardial infarction , vascular death , and death from any cause compared with aspirin .
RESULTS	No interaction between smoking status and study treatment was observed for bleeding events .
CONCLUSIONS	In a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE population , current smokers appeared to have enhanced benefit with clopidogrel therapy for secondary prevention compared with aspirin .
CONCLUSIONS	These results should be considered hypothesis generating for future prospective studies assessing the impact of specific platelet-inhibiting strategies according to smoking status .

###24850938
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of faculty-led problem-based learning ( PBL ) vs online simulated-patient case in fourth-year ( P@ ) pharmacy students .
METHODS	Fourth-year pharmacy students were randomly assigned to participate in either online branched-case learning using a virtual simulation platform or a small-group discussion .
METHODS	Preexperience and postexperience student assessments and a survey instrument were completed .
RESULTS	While there were no significant differences in the preexperience test scores between the groups , there was a significant increase in scores in both the virtual-patient group and the PBL group between the preexperience and postexperience tests .
RESULTS	The PBL group had higher postexperience test scores ( @ ) than did the virtual-patient group ( @ ) ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The PBL method demonstrated significantly greater improvement in postexperience test scores than did the virtual-patient method .
CONCLUSIONS	Both were successful learning methods , suggesting that a diverse approach to simulated patient cases may reach more student learning styles .

BACKGROUND	Hamilton depression rating scale ( HAMD ) subscales provide an economic alternative for the full scale ; however , their ability to detect onset of improvement in the early course of treatment ( EI ) has not yet been researched .
BACKGROUND	The present study investigated in patients with major depression ( MD ) whether the subscales are a comparable option to predict treatment remission in the early course of treatment .
METHODS	Based on data from @ MD patients of a @-week randomised , placebo-controlled trial comparing mirtazapine ( MIR ) and paroxetine ( PAR ) , the discriminative and predictive validity of EI for ( stable ) remission at treatment end was evaluated for seven subscales and the HAMD@ in the total and in treatment subgroups ( MIR vs. PAR ) .
METHODS	Receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) curves ( at week @ ) and the Clinical Global Impression scales ( CGI ) ( at study endpoint ) were used to validate the @ % EI criterion for the subscales .
RESULTS	Only the Evans@ and Toronto@ subscale had almost the same predictive value as the HAMD@ ( e.g. , sensitivities stable remission Evans@/Toronto@ : @/@ % vs. @ % HAMD@ ) .
RESULTS	The optimal cut-off for EI to predict remission was just below @ % for most subscales and slightly over @ % for stable remission .
CONCLUSIONS	Study sample representativeness , non-independence of subscales , missing external validation criterion , lack of control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The Evans@ and Toronto@ subscales are valuable alternatives in situations , where economic aspects play a larger role .
CONCLUSIONS	A sum score reduction of @ % as definition for EI seems also appropriate for the HAMD subscales , in the total as well as in the antidepressant subgroups .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a T-piece resuscitator compared with a self-inflating bag for providing mask ventilation to newborns at birth .
METHODS	Newborns at @ weeks gestational age receiving positive-pressure ventilation at birth were included in this multicenter cluster-randomized @-period crossover trial .
METHODS	Positive-pressure ventilation was provided with either a self-inflating bag ( self-inflating bag group ) with or without a positive end-expiratory pressure valve or a T-piece with a positive end-expiratory pressure valve ( T-piece group ) .
METHODS	Delivery room management followed American Academy of Pediatrics and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the proportion of newborns with heart rate ( HR ) @ bpm at @ minutes after birth .
RESULTS	A total of @ newborns were included .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of HR@ bpm at @ minutes after birth between the T-piece and self-inflating bag groups : @ % ( @ of @ ) and @ % ( @ of @ ) , respectively ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ newborns ( @ % ) in the T-piece group and @ newborns ( @ % ) in the self-inflating bag group were intubated in the delivery room ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The meanSD maximum positive inspiratory pressure was @ cm H@O in the T-piece group vs @ cm H@O in the self-inflating bag group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Air leaks , use of drugs/chest compressions , mortality , and days on mechanical ventilation did not differ significantly between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no difference between the T-piece resuscitator and a self-inflating bag in achieving an HR of @ bpm at @ minutes in newborns@ weeks gestational age resuscitated at birth .
CONCLUSIONS	However , use of the T-piece decreased the intubation rate and the maximum pressures applied .

OBJECTIVE	To compare operative time with use of THUNDERBEAT ( TB ) vs standard electrosurgery ( SES ) during laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy to treat gynecologic tumors .
METHODS	Evidence obtained from a properly designed , randomized , controlled trial ( Canadian Task Force classification I ) .
METHODS	Gynecologic Oncology Unit of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome , Italy .
METHODS	Fifty patients with early cervical cancer ( FIGO stages IA@ , IB@ , IIA < @ cm ) or locally advanced cervical cancer ( FIGO stages IB@ , IIA > @cm , IIB ) who received neoadjuvant treatment ( chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy ) and demonstrated a complete or partial clinical response and early stage endometrioid endometrial cancer ( FIGO stages IB , II ) were randomly assigned to undergo TB ( arm A ) or SES ( arm B ) .
METHODS	Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy , using an easily reproducible technique was performed .
RESULTS	Fifty patients were available for analysis , with @ women randomly assigned to TB ( arm A ) and @ to SES ( arm B ) .
RESULTS	The median operative time was @ minutes for TB vs @ minutes for SES ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At multivariate analysis , endometrial cancer ( p = @ ) and TB ( p = @ ) were independently associated with shorter operating time .
RESULTS	No differences in perioperative outcomes and postoperative complications were observed between the @ arms .
RESULTS	Patients who underwent TB reported less postoperative pain , both at rest ( p = @ ) and after the Valsalva maneuver ( p = @ ) , with less additional analgesic therapy other than standard therapy required in patients who underwent SES ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	TB is associated with shorter operative time and less postoperative pain than is the standard technique ( SES ) in patients with uterine cancer .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the long-term efficacy of pain reduction by two dose-fractionation schedules for radiotherapy of painful shoulder syndrome .
METHODS	Between February @ and February @ , @evaluable patients were recruited for this prospective trial .
METHODS	All patients received low-dose orthovoltage radiotherapy .
METHODS	One course consisted of @fractions in @weeks .
METHODS	In the case of insufficient pain remission after @weeks , a second course was administered .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive single doses of either @ or @ Gy .
METHODS	Endpoint was pain reduction .
METHODS	Pain was measured before radiotherapy , as well as immediately after ( early response ) , @weeks after ( delayed response ) and approximately @years after ( long-term response ) completion of radiotherapy using a questionnaire-based visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and a comprehensive pain score ( CPS ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @months ( range@-@ ) .
RESULTS	The overall early , delayed and long-term response rates for all patients were @ , @ and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	The mean VAS scores before treatment and those for early , delayed and long-term response in the @ - and @-Gy groups were @ and @ ( p = @ ) ; @ and @ ( p = @ ) ; @ and @ ( p = @ ) and @ and @ ( p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The mean CPS values before treatment and those for early , delayed and long-term response were @ and @ ( p = @ ) ; @ and @ ( p = @ ) ; @ and @ ( p = @ ) and @ and @ ( p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	No significant differences in the quality of the long-term response were found between the @ - and @-Gy arms ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for the management of benign painful shoulder syndrome .
CONCLUSIONS	For radiation protection reasons , the dose for a radiotherapy series should not exceed @ Gy .

OBJECTIVE	Management of recent-onset schizophrenia ( SZ ) and schizoaffective disorder ( SA ) is challenging owing to frequent insufficient response to antipsychotic agents .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to test the efficacy and safety of the neurosteroid pregnenolone in patients with recent-onset SZ/SA .
METHODS	Sixty out - and inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for SZ/SA , with suboptimal response to antipsychotics were recruited for an @-week , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , two-center add-on trial , that was conducted between @ and @ .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to receive either pregnenolone ( @mg/day ) or placebo added on to antipsychotic medications .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale and the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included assessments of functioning , and side-effects .
RESULTS	Analysis was by linear mixed model .
RESULTS	Fifty-two participants ( @ % ) completed the trial .
RESULTS	Compared to placebo , adjunctive pregnenolone significantly reduced Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale negative symptom scores with moderate effect sizes ( d = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant improvement was observed in weeks @ and @ of pregnenolone therapy among patients who were not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers ( armsvisitmood stabilizers ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Likewise , pregnenolone significantly reduced Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores compared to placebo ( d = @ ) , especially on blunted affect , avolition and anhedonia domain scores .
RESULTS	Other symptoms , functioning , and side-effects were not significantly affected by adjunctive pregnenolone .
RESULTS	Antipsychotic agents , benzodiazepines and sex did not associate with pregnenolone augmentation .
RESULTS	Pregnenolone was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , add-on pregnenolone reduces the severity of negative symptoms in recent-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder , especially among patients who are not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted .

BACKGROUND	Loneliness in older people is associated with poor health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) .
BACKGROUND	We undertook a parallel-group randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone befriending for the maintenance of HRQoL in older people .
BACKGROUND	An internal pilot tested the feasibility of the trial and intervention .
METHODS	Participants aged > @years , with good cognitive function , living independently in one UK city were recruited through general practices and other sources , then randomised to : ( @ ) @weeks of short one-to-one telephone calls , followed by @weeks of group telephone calls with up to six participants , led by a trained volunteer facilitator ; or ( @ ) a control group .
METHODS	The main trial required the recruitment of @ participants in a @-year accrual window , of whom @ were to receive telephone befriending .
METHODS	The pilot specified three success criteria which had to be met in order to progress the main trial to completion : recruitment of @ participants in @days ; retention of @ % participants at @months ; successful delivery of telephone befriending by local franchise of national charity .
METHODS	The primary clinical outcome was the Short Form ( @ ) Health Instrument ( SF-@ ) Mental Health ( MH ) dimension score collected by telephone @months following randomisation .
RESULTS	We informed @,@ older people about the study .
RESULTS	Seventy consenting participants were randomised to the pilot in @days , with @ ( @ % ) providing valid primary outcome data ( @ intervention , @ control ) .
RESULTS	Twenty-four participants randomly allocated to the research arm actually received telephone befriending due to poor recruitment and retention of volunteer facilitators .
RESULTS	The trial was closed early as a result .
RESULTS	The mean @-month SF-@ MH scores were @ ( SD @ ) and @ ( SD @ ) for the intervention and control groups , respectively ( mean difference , @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Recruitment and retention of participants to a definitive trial with a recruitment window of @year is feasible .
CONCLUSIONS	For the voluntary sector to recruit sufficient volunteers to match demand for telephone befriending created by trial recruitment would require the study to be run in more than one major population centre , and/or involve dedicated management of volunteers .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention to decrease pediatric emergency department ( PED ) visits and adverse care practices for upper respiratory infections ( URI ) among predominantly Latino Early Head Start ( EHS ) families .
METHODS	Four EHS sites in New York City were randomized .
METHODS	Families at intervention sites received @ @-hour education modules in their EHS parent-child group focusing on URIs , over-the-counter medications , and medication management .
METHODS	Standard curriculum families received the standard EHS curriculum , which did not include URI education .
METHODS	During weekly telephone calls for @ months , families reported URI in family members , care sought , and medications given .
METHODS	Pre - and post-intervention knowledge-attitude surveys were also conducted .
METHODS	Outcomes were compared between groups .
RESULTS	There were @ families who participated ( @ intervention , @ standard curriculum ) including @ children < @ years old .
RESULTS	Families were primarily Latino and Spanish-speaking .
RESULTS	Intervention families were significantly less likely to visit the PED when their young child ( age @ to < @ months ) was ill ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The difference remained significant on the family level ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	These families were also less likely to use an inappropriate over-the-counter medication for their < @-year-old child ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and/or incorrect dosing tool for their < @-year-old child ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; @ % vs @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean difference in Knowledge-Attitude scores for intervention families was higher .
CONCLUSIONS	A URI health literacy-related educational intervention embedded into EHS decreased PED visits and adverse care practices .

BACKGROUND	The promising results of Schroth scoliosis-specific exercises for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis found in low-quality studies will be strengthened by confirmation in a randomised controlled trial .
OBJECTIVE	@ .
OBJECTIVE	Are Schroth exercises combined with standard care for @ months more effective than standard care alone in improving radiographic and clinical outcomes for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis ?
OBJECTIVE	@ .
OBJECTIVE	Will the outcomes of the control group ( who will be offered Schroth therapy delayed by @ months ) improve after @ months of Schroth therapy ?
OBJECTIVE	@ .
OBJECTIVE	Are the effects maintained @ months after discontinuing the supervised intervention ?
METHODS	This is an assessor-blinded and statistician-blinded randomised controlled trial with transfer of the controls to the exercise group after @ months .
METHODS	Two hundred and fifty-eight consecutive adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis , aged @ to @ years , treated with or without a brace , with curves between @ and @ deg Cobb and Risser sign @ will be recruited from three scoliosis clinics .
METHODS	Combined with standard care , the Schroth group will receive five individual training sessions , followed by weekly group classes and daily home exercises for @ months .
METHODS	Controls will only receive standard care consisting of observation or bracing , and will be offered Schroth therapy @ months later .
METHODS	Curve severity ( Cobb angle ) and vertebral rotation will be assessed from radiographs at baseline , @ and @ months .
METHODS	Secondary clinical outcomes ( back muscle endurance , surface topography measures of posture , and self-reported perceived spinal appearance and quality of life ) will be assessed at baseline , and every @ months until @-year follow-up .
METHODS	Data will be analysed using intention-to-treat linear mixed models .
CONCLUSIONS	The results will demonstrate whether Schroth exercises combined with standard of care can improve outcomes in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis .
CONCLUSIONS	This study has potential to influence clinical practice worldwide , where exercises are not routinely prescribed for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis .

###24408401
OBJECTIVE	Endogenous insulin secretion , measured by C-peptide area under the curve ( AUC ) , can be tested using both the glucagon stimulation test ( GST ) and the mixed-meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) .
OBJECTIVE	This study compares these two stimulation methods using long-term data from patients newly diagnosed with type @ diabetes or with latent autoimmune diabetes .
METHODS	A recently completed phase @ intervention study with DiaPep@ demonstrated improved glycemic control and a significant treatment effect of glucagon-stimulated C-peptide secretion .
METHODS	Unexpectedly , MMTT failed to detect differences between the treated and control groups .
METHODS	Data from @ patients in two balanced-randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trials of DiaPep@ were used to compare and correlate between GST - and MMTT-derived C-peptide AUC .
METHODS	Pearson 's correlations were calculated for absolute C-peptide AUC at baseline and @ and @ months and for long-term changes in AUC ( AUC ) .
RESULTS	The absolute AUC values obtained at any single time point by the two tests were well correlated in both data sets ( r = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the correlations between the AUC were much weaker ( r = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	GST-stimulated C-peptide secretion was stable over the fasting glucose range permitted for the test ( @-@ @ mmol/L ) , but MMTT-stimulated C-peptide secretion decreased over the same range , implying differences in sensitivity to glucose .
CONCLUSIONS	Measurement of long-term changes in stimulated C-peptide , reflecting endogenous insulin secretion , during the course of intervention trials may be affected by the method of stimulation , possibly reflecting different sensitivities to the physiological status of the tested subject .

BACKGROUND	The results of the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial showed positive benefits from blood pressure-lowering treatment in those aged @ and over .
METHODS	An analysis by the pre-specified subgroups -LSB- age , sex , history of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and initial SBP -RSB- was performed .
METHODS	The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of @ participants aged @ and over with SBPs of @-@ mmHg and diastolic pressures below @ mmHg recruited from Europe , China , Australasia and Tunisia .
METHODS	Active treatment was indapamide sustained-release @ mg with the addition of perindopril @-@ mg as required to reach a target blood pressure of less than @/@ mmHg .
RESULTS	For total mortality , benefits were consistent : men -LSB- hazard ratio @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- , women ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , those aged @-@ @ ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , those aged @ and over ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , those with a history of CVD ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) and those without ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and similarly across a range of baseline SBPs .
RESULTS	The point estimates for cardiovascular mortality , strokes , heart failure and cardiovascular events were all in favour of benefit .
RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis , strokes were reduced by @ % ( P = @ ) , total mortality by @ % ( P = @ ) , cardiovascular event by @ % ( P < @ ) and heart failure by @ % ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In hypertensive patients aged @ or more , treatment based on indapamide ( sustained-release ) @ mg showed consistent benefits across pre-specified subgroups including those without established CVD ( the majority ) , supporting the need for treatment even at this advanced age .
CONCLUSIONS	There were too few aged @ or over to determine benefit from treatment at extreme age .

METHODS	The intervention included the modules : `` What is cancer ?
METHODS	, '' `` Sun protection , '' `` Non smoking , '' and `` Physical activity , Healthy nutrition , and Limited alcohol consumption . ''
METHODS	Outcomes measured at baseline and at the end of the one week BSAC program included knowledge of cancer and its behavioral risk factors , health-promoting intentions , and reported risk behavior .
RESULTS	BSAC was effective in increasing knowledge about cancer and risk factors for cancer ( p < @ ) , as well as in increasing intentions to engage in health-promoting behavior ( p < @ ) , independent of a student 's risk profile .
RESULTS	Knowledge did not serve as a mediator for intention building .
CONCLUSIONS	The BSAC is an effective school-based program for raising awareness of cancer , associated risk factors and intentions to engage in cancer-preventive behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that the effectiveness of BSAC is independent of a student 's risk profile .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , it holds considerable promise as a broadly applicable program to raise cancer awareness and promote healthy behavior intentions .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the relationship between spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) and standard automated perimetry ( SAP ) in healthy and glaucoma individuals .
METHODS	The sample comprised @ individuals divided into @ groups according to intraocular pressure and visual field outcomes .
METHODS	All participants underwent a reliable SAP and imaging of the optic nerve head with the Cirrus OCT. .
METHODS	Pearson correlations were calculated between threshold sensitivity values of SAP ( converted to linear scale ) and OCT parameters .
RESULTS	Mean age did not differ between the control and glaucoma groups ( @ @ years and @ @ years , resp. ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant differences were found for the threshold sensitivities at each of the @ points evaluated with SAP ( P < @ ) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thicknesses , except at @ and @ clock-hour positions between both groups .
RESULTS	Mild to moderate correlations ( ranging between @ and @ ; P < @ ) were observed between SAP and most OCT parameters in the glaucoma group .
RESULTS	The strongest correlations were found between the inferior RNFL thickness and the superior hemifield points .
RESULTS	The healthy group showed lower and weaker correlations than the glaucoma group .
CONCLUSIONS	Peripapillary RNFL thickness measured with Cirrus OCT showed mild to moderate correlations with SAP in glaucoma patients .

OBJECTIVE	Post-menopausal women are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and bone demineralization .
OBJECTIVE	Phytosterols ( PS ) may be used for hypercholesterolemia in some groups and - cryptoxanthin ( - Cx ) displays a unique anabolic effect on bone .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to assess the changes in cardiovascular and bone turnover markers from the oral intake of - Cx and PS in post-menopausal women .
RESULTS	A randomized , double-blind , crossover study with - Cx ( @ mg/day ) and PS ( @ g/day ) , single and combined , was performed in @ postmenopausal women .
RESULTS	Diet was supplemented with @ @ mL milk-based fruit drink/day for @ weeks with a wash-out period of @-weeks in between .
RESULTS	Serum - Cx and PS were determined by UPLC and CG-FID respectively .
RESULTS	Outcome variables included markers of bone turnover and cardiovascular risk .
RESULTS	Biological effect was assessed by paired t test and generalized estimating equations analysis that included the previous treatment , the order of intervention and the interactions .
RESULTS	The intake of beverages containing - Cx and PS brought about a significant increase in serum levels of - Cx , - sitosterol and campesterol .
RESULTS	Intervention caused changes in almost all the markers while the order , previous treatment and the interaction did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	Only the intake of the beverage containing - Cx plus PS brought about significant decreases in total cholesterol , c-HDL , c-LDL and bone turnover markers .
CONCLUSIONS	- Cx improves the cholesterol-lowering effect of PS when supplied simultaneously and this combination may also be beneficial in reducing risk of osteoporosis .

BACKGROUND	Nonadherence to treatment leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes and enormous costs to the economy .
BACKGROUND	This is especially important in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
BACKGROUND	The progressive nature of the degenerative process , the complex treatment regimens and the high rates of comorbid conditions make treatment adherence in PD a challenge .
BACKGROUND	Clinicians have limited face-to-face consultation time with PD patients , making it difficult to comprehensively address non-adherence .
BACKGROUND	The rapid growth of digital technologies provides an opportunity to improve adherence and the quality of decision-making during consultation .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) is to evaluate the impact of using a smartphone and web applications to promote patient self-management as a tool to increase treatment adherence and working with the data collected to enhance the quality of clinical consultation .
METHODS	A @-month multicentre RCT with @ patients will be conducted to compare use of a smartphone - and internet-enabled Parkinson 's tracker smartphone app with treatment as usual for patients with PD and/or their carers .
METHODS	The study investigators will compare the two groups immediately after intervention .
METHODS	Seven centres across England ( @ ) and Scotland ( @ ) will be involved .
METHODS	The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether patients with PD who use the app show improved medication adherence compared to those receiving treatment as usual alone .
METHODS	The secondary objectives are to investigate whether patients who receive the app and those who receive treatment as usual differ in terms of quality of life , quality of clinical consultation , overall disease state and activities of daily living .
METHODS	We also aim to investigate the experience of those receiving the intervention by conducting qualitative interviews with a sample of participants and clinicians , which will be administered by independent researchers .

BACKGROUND	The role of adjuvant bisphosphonates in early breast cancer is uncertain .
BACKGROUND	We therefore did a large randomised trial to investigate the effect of the adjuvant use of zoledronic acid on disease-free survival ( DFS ) in high-risk patients with early breast cancer .
METHODS	In the AZURE trial , an open-label , international , multicentre , randomised , controlled , parallel-group phase @ trial , women ( age @ years ) with stage II or III breast cancer were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) by a central automated @-h computer-generated telephone minimisation system ( balanced for number of involved axillary lymph nodes , tumour stage , oestrogen receptor status , type and timing of systemic therapy , menopausal status , statin use , and treatment centre ) to receive standard adjuvant systemic treatment alone ( control group ) or with @ mg intravenous zoledronic acid every @-@ weeks for six doses , then every @ months for eight doses , followed by every @ months for five doses , for a total of @ years of treatment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was disease-free survival ( DFS ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were invasive DFS ( IDFS ) , overall survival , time to bone metastases , time to distant recurrence , and subgroup analyses of variables included in the randomisation .
METHODS	All patients have completed study treatment .
METHODS	Results from the intention-to-treat final analysis of this fully recruited study are presented after a median follow-up of @ months ( IQR @-@ ) .
METHODS	This final efficacy analysis was planned to take place after @ DFS events .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ women were recruited from @ centres in seven countries between Sept @ , @ , and Feb @ , @ .
RESULTS	The number of DFS events did not differ between groups : @ in the control group and @ in the zoledronic acid group ( adjusted hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	IDFS ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) , overall survival ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) , and distant recurrences ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) were much the same in both groups .
RESULTS	Zoledronic acid reduced the development of bone metastases , both as a first event ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) and at any time during follow-up ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The effects of zoledronic acid on DFS were not affected by oestrogen-receptor status .
RESULTS	However , zoledronic acid improved IDFS in those who were over @ years since menopause at trial entry ( n = @ ; HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) but not in all other ( premenopause , perimenopause , and unknown status ) menopausal groups ( n = @ ; HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) .
RESULTS	@ cases of suspected osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported , with @ confirmed on central review , all in the zoledronic acid group ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest no overall benefit from the addition of zoledronic acid to standard adjuvant treatments for early breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	However , zoledronic acid does reduce the development of bone metastases and , for women with established menopause , improved disease outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to test the hypothesis of whether amlodipine reduces the risk for death in patients with heart failure due to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy .
BACKGROUND	A pre-specified subgroup analysis in an earlier , large-scale , placebo-controlled study suggested that amlodipine might reduce the risk for death in patients with heart failure due to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy .
METHODS	To evaluate this hypothesis , @ patients with severe heart failure due to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction < @ % ) were randomly assigned to amlodipine ( target dose : @ mg/d ) or placebo added to conventional therapy for heart failure for a median of @ months .
RESULTS	There were @ deaths in the amlodipine group and @ deaths in the placebo group ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The differences between the @ groups in the risks for cardiovascular death and hospitalization were also not significant .
RESULTS	When the results from patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy in both the earlier trial and in the current study were combined , there was no evidence of a favorable or unfavorable effect of amlodipine on mortality ( hazard ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both trials , however , observed higher frequencies of peripheral edema and pulmonary edema and lower frequencies of uncontrolled hypertension and chest pain in patients treated with amlodipine .
CONCLUSIONS	These results of the current trial , viewed together with the results from the earlier study , indicate that amlodipine does not exert favorable effects on the clinical course of patients with heart failure , regardless of the presence or absence of underlying coronary artery disease .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings indicate the need for great caution when striking benefits are observed in subgroups of patients or in trials not primarily designed to assess such effects .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between nasal irrigation techniques ( NIT ) and the survival rate and the quality of life ( QOL ) in patients with nasal sinusitis ( NS ) .
METHODS	We studied data from @ patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) who received radical radiotherapy , which were randomly divided into three groups ( A , B and C ) .
METHODS	Group A used nasal irrigator ; Group B used homemade nasal irrigation ( NI ) connector combined with enemator ; and Group C used nasal sprayer .
METHODS	The clinical effects , @-year overall survival ( OS ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) were observed .
METHODS	Furthermore , the QOL in patients with NS was evaluated using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test @ .
RESULTS	The median follow-up time was @ months .
RESULTS	The @-year OS and PFS were @ % and @ % , respectively , for all patients .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in OS , PFS , xerostomia and neck skin toxicity grade @ and greater among groups .
RESULTS	There was no difference among groups .
RESULTS	The incidence of NS was the highest in group C.
CONCLUSIONS	The symptoms of NS seriously affected the QOL period of @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	Group C showed no improvement during the follow-up period , which for A and B , by contrast , had after @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the exact mechanism remains to be explored in NIT , our findings suggest that patients with NPC should nasal irrigate for @ years after radiotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study shows that a nasal irrigator is necessary for patients with NPC for a high QOL in terms of NS .

BACKGROUND	Characterized as a sudden and temporary loss of consciousness and postural tone , with quick and spontaneous recovery , syncope is caused by an acute reduction of systemic arterial pressure and , therefore , of cerebral blood flow .
BACKGROUND	Unsatisfactory results with the use of drugs allowed the nonpharmacological treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope was contemplated as the first therapeutic option .
OBJECTIVE	To compare , in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope , the impact of a moderate intensity aerobic physical training ( AFT ) and a control intervention on the positivity of head-up tilting test ( HUT ) and orthostatic tolerance time .
METHODS	Were studied @ patients with a history of recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope and HUT .
METHODS	The patients were randomized into : trained group ( TG ) , n = @ , and control group ( CG ) , n = @ .
METHODS	The TG was submitted to @ weeks of AFT supervised , in cycle ergometer , and the CG to a control procedure that consisted in @ minutes of stretching and @ minutes of light walk .
RESULTS	The TG had a positive effect to physical training , with a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption .
RESULTS	The CG did not show any statistically significant change before and after the intervention .
RESULTS	After the intervention period , @ % of the TG sample had negative results to the HUT , not having syncope in the revaluation .
CONCLUSIONS	The program of supervised aerobic physical training for @ weeks was able to reduce the number of positive HUT , as it was able to increase tolerance time in orthostatic position during the HUT after the intervention period .

BACKGROUND	Lumboperitoneal shunt surgery has the potential to alleviate symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus but the benefits of such surgery have not been tested in a randomised trial .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of the lumboperitoneal shunt surgery for this disorder .
METHODS	For the open-label randomised SINPHONI-@ trial , eligible participants ( @-@ years of age ) with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus , with ventriculomegaly , and tightness of the high-convexity and medial subarachnoid spaces on MRI , were recruited from @ neurological and neurosurgical centres in Japan .
METHODS	Enrolled participants were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio according to a random code generated by the trial statistician , with a permuted block design ( using a block size of @ or @ ) within each centre , to receive lumboperitoneal shunt surgery within @ month after randomisation , or to surgery postponed for @ months .
METHODS	Patients and assessors were not masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was favourable outcome , defined as an improvement of one point or more on the modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) at @ months after randomisation , analysed by intention to treat , and the main secondary endpoint was the same outcome @ months after surgery , analysed per protocol .
METHODS	This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry ( UMIN-CTR ) , number UMIN@ .
RESULTS	Between March @ , @ , and Oct @ , @ , @ patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus were enrolled and randomly assigned to the immediate treatment group ( n = @ ) or the postponed treatment group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	More patients in the immediate treatment group than in the postponed treatment group had an improvement of one point or more on the mRS at @ months : @ ( @ % ) of @ in the immediate group vs @ ( @ % ) of @ in the postponed group ( difference @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of patients who had an improvement of one point or more on the mRS at @ months after surgery was similar between the two groups : @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the immediate group vs @ ( @ % ) of @ in the postponed group ( difference @ % -LSB- @ % CI -@ to @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The proportions of patients with serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups during the @ months post-randomisation ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ in the immediate group vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ in the postponed group ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	During the @ months after surgery , @ ( @ % ) of @ patients had serious adverse events , the most common of which was cerebral infarction ( six patients -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that lumboperitoneal shunt surgery might be beneficial for patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and , if these findings are confirmed in larger studies , could be a first-line treatment option for this disease .

BACKGROUND	Breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) has shown high sensitivity in determining tumor extent , multifocality , and occult contralateral breast cancer .
BACKGROUND	Low specificity , unnecessary mastectomies , and costs are arguments against MRI .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative breast MRI would affect primary surgical management , reduce reexcision/reoperation procedures , and influence the choice of neoadjuvant treatment in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer .
METHODS	This prospective , randomized , multicenter study included @ breast cancer patients younger than aged @ years from three , Swedish , large-volume breast units .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated on a @:@ basis to either preoperative staging with breast MRI ( n = @ ) or no breast MRI ( n = @ ) ( control group ) .
METHODS	Treatment planning of all patients was discussed at multidisciplinary team conferences .
RESULTS	In patients randomized to the MRI group , who had an observed higher percentage of planned breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) compared with the control group , a change from suggested breast conservation to mastectomy occurred in @ of @ ( @ % ) patients .
RESULTS	Breast MRI provided additional information in @ of @ ( @ % ) patients , which caused a change in treatment plan in @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The breast reoperation rate was significantly lower in the MRI group : @ of @ ( @ % ) versus @ of @ ( @ % ) in the control group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of mastectomies , axillary reoperations , and the number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after definitive treatment did not differ significantly between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative staging with breast MRI in women younger than age @ years altered the treatment plan in @ % of the patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Although a higher MRI-related conversion rate from breast conservation to mastectomy was found , the final numbers of mastectomies did not differ between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The breast reoperation rate in the MRI group was significantly reduced .

OBJECTIVE	Pain at the surgery site is a common complaint in patients who experience percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this double-blind , randomized clinical trial is evaluation of the effect of scheduled infusion of bupivacaine on postsurgical pain and narcotic consumption after tubeless PCNL under spinal anesthesia .
METHODS	Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups .
METHODS	A small caliber fenestrated feeding tube was placed into the nephrostomy tract under direct vision in a manner in which its tip lied close to the renal capsule .
METHODS	The study group received infusion of diluted bupivacaine while physiologic saline was injected in the control group .
METHODS	Each patient was given the same dose every @ hours until @ hours after the surgical procedure .
RESULTS	Mean pethidine injection was significantly lower in the group who underwent bupivacaine instillation ( @ vs @ mg : P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between mean visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score in these two groups after @ and @ hours while it was significantly lower after @ and @ hours in the patients who had received bupivacaine .
RESULTS	Mean time to the first analgesic request was significantly longer in the study group ( @ vs @ hours : P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intermittent perirenal instillation of bupivacaine via the nephrostomy tract after PCNL decreases the need for more systemic narcotics and provides acceptable analgesia in the postoperative period .

BACKGROUND	Inflammation plays a major role in diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
BACKGROUND	There is uncertainty whether diet and physical activity interventions can be successfully integrated into healthcare settings and reduce markers of inflammation and risk of CVD in patients with type @ diabetes ( T@D ) .
RESULTS	Systemic markers of inflammation were determined in a @-month , real-world , multicenter , randomized , controlled trial that investigated the effect of diet , diet plus physical activity , and usual care in @ individuals with newly diagnosed T@D .
RESULTS	During the first @ months , serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) improved by -@ ( -@ to -@ ) % and -@ ( -@ to -@ ) % in diet and diet plus physical activity arms versus usual care .
RESULTS	There were also improvements in adiponectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-@ ( sICAM-@ ) .
RESULTS	Though medication-adjusted CRP was improved between @ and @ months for usual care , both interventions were more successful in reducing the relative risk of a high-risk CRP level of > @ mg/L ( risk ratios of @ -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- for diet versus usual care and @ -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- for diet plus activity versus usual care ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , sICAM-@ ( a marker of vascular risk ) , remained substantially lower than usual care in both intervention arms at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Motivational , unsupervised diet and/or diet plus physical activity interventions given soon after diagnosis in real-world healthcare settings improve markers of inflammation and cardiovascular risk in patients with T@D , even after accounting for the effect of adjustments to medication to try and control blood pressure , glycated hemoglobin , and lipids .

BACKGROUND	This study seeks to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of baseline clinical and psychological features and treatment response characteristics that differentiate Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) outpatients with and without melancholic features .
BACKGROUND	Reflecting the emphasis in DSM-@ , we also include impairment and distress .
METHODS	Participants were assessed pre-treatment on clinical features ( severity , risk factors , comorbid conditions , illness course ) , psychological profile ( personality , emotion regulation ) , functional capacity ( social and occupational function , quality of life ) and distress/coping ( negativity bias , emotional resilience , social skills , satisfaction with life ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to sertraline , escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release and re-assessed post-treatment at @ weeks regarding remission , response , and change in impairment and distress .
RESULTS	Patients with melancholic features ( n = @ ; @ % ) were distinguished clinically from non-melancholics by more severe depressive symptoms and greater exposure to abuse in childhood .
RESULTS	Psychologically , melancholic patients were defined by introversion , and a greater use of suppression to regulate negative emotion .
RESULTS	Melancholics also had poorer capacity for social and occupational function , and physical and psychological quality of life , along with poorer coping , reflected in less emotional resilience and capacity for social skills .
RESULTS	Post-treatment , melancholic patients had lower remission and response , but some of this effect was due to the more severe symptoms pre-treatment .
RESULTS	The distress/coping outcome measure of capacity for social skills remained significantly lower for melancholic participants .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study , causal pathways can not be concluded .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings provide new insights into a melancholic profile of reduced ability to function interpersonally or effectively deal with ones emotions .
CONCLUSIONS	This distinctly poorer capacity for social skills remained post-treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The pre-treatment profile may account for some of the difficulty in achieving remission or response with treatment .

BACKGROUND	Patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) lose brain volume ( BV ) faster than healthy individuals .
OBJECTIVE	Our purpose , within the @-month phase @ TRANSFORMS study , was to examine the effect of treatment on BV loss in patient subgroups , establish correlations between baseline normalized BV ( NBV ) and baseline disease parameters , to identify variables predictive of baseline NBV and on-study percentage BV change ( PBVC ) , and to establish correlations between on-study PBVC and on-study efficacy outcomes .
METHODS	Patients received fingolimod @ mg or @ mg , or intramuscular ( IM ) interferon -@ a ( IFN-@a ) for @ months .
METHODS	The effect of treatment on PBVC was examined in patient demographic , disease and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) characteristic subgroups .
METHODS	Pearson 's correlation analyses and a stepwise linear regression model were used to identify variables predictive of NBV and PBVC .
RESULTS	Fingolimod reduced BV loss over @ months versus IFN-@a IM in all patient subgroups assessed , including individuals with or without gadolinium ( Gd ) - enhancing lesions at baseline .
RESULTS	Baseline T@ hypointense lesion volume had the strongest correlation with baseline NBV .
RESULTS	Baseline Gd-enhancing T@ lesion count was most predictive of change in PBVC over @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results improve understanding of the contributions of different baseline demographic , clinical and MRI characteristics to NBV , including factors that may be predictive of future BV loss .

METHODS	Eligibility criteria included stage IIIB-IV NSCLC and sufficient tumor specimen for molecular analysis .
METHODS	Randomization to the control or experimental arm was @ : @ in the SLCG trial and @ : @ in the Chinese trial .
METHODS	In both trials , patients in the control arm received docetaxel/cisplatin ; in the experimental arm , patients with low RAP@ expression received gemcitabine/cisplatin , those with intermediate/high RAP@ expression and low/intermediate BRCA@ expression received docetaxel/cisplatin , and those with intermediate/high RAP@ expression and high BRCA@ expression received docetaxel alone .
METHODS	The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
RESULTS	Two hundred and seventy-nine patients in the SLCG trial and @ in the Chinese trial were assessable for PFS .
RESULTS	PFS in the control and experimental arms in the SLCG trial was @ and @ months , respectively -LSB- log rank P = @ ; hazard ratio ( HR ) @ ; P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	In the Chinese trial , PFS was @ and @ months , respectively ( log rank P = @ ; HR @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Accrual was prematurely closed on the SLCG trial due to the absence of clinical benefit in the experimental over the control arm .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the BREC studies provide proof of concept that an international , nonindustry , biomarker-directed trial is feasible .
CONCLUSIONS	Thanks to the groundwork laid by these studies , we expect that ongoing further research on alternative biomarkers to elucidate DNA repair mechanisms will help define novel therapeutic approaches .

OBJECTIVE	To determine pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin in water buffalo calves ( Bubalus bubalis ) after multiple SC administrations and to assess differences in regimen efficacy .
METHODS	@ healthy buffalo calves .
METHODS	Calves ( n = @ calves/group ) were assigned to receive marbofloxacin SC in the neck at @ of @ dosages ( @ mg/kg , q @ h for @ days -LSB- regimen @ -RSB- ; @ mg/kg , q @ h for @ days -LSB- regimen @ -RSB- ; and @ mg/kg , q @ h for @ days -LSB- regimen @ -RSB- ) .
METHODS	Serum marbofloxacin concentrations were analyzed .
METHODS	Efficacy predictors were estimated on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentration and mutant prevention concentration reported for Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica .
RESULTS	Mean SD area under the concentration-time curve was @ @ gh/mL for regimen @ , which differed significantly from that for regimens @ ( @ @ gh/mL ) and @ ( @ @ gh/mL ) .
RESULTS	Mean residence time and mean elimination half-life for regimen @ ( @ @ hours and @ @ hours ) both differed significantly from those for regimens @ ( @ @ hours and @ @ hours ) and @ ( @ @ hours and @ @ hours ) .
RESULTS	Values obtained from indices for P multocida and M haemolytica had an excessively wide range because of the various degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility ( low , medium , and high ) of the strains .
CONCLUSIONS	Regimen @ had the most favorable indices , and it would be conducive for owner compliance and require less handling of animals .

OBJECTIVE	Cixutumumab , formerly IMC-A@ , is a recombinant human monoclonal immunoglobulin G@ antibody that targets insulin-like growth factor I receptor ( IGF-IR ) .
OBJECTIVE	Cixutumumab was synergistic with castration in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer xenograft model .
METHODS	Patients with new metastatic prostate cancer were randomly assigned within @ days of initiating androgen deprivation ( AD ) to cixutumumab added to a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with bicalutamide versus AD alone .
METHODS	With @ patients and one-sided alpha of @ , there would be @ % power to detect an absolute @ % difference in undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ; @ ng/mL ) rate at @ weeks ( relative risk , @ ) ; this end point was previously strongly correlated with survival .
METHODS	Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with PSA > @ ng/mL , safety and tolerability , circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) levels , and seven plasma IGF-IR biomarkers .
METHODS	Fisher 's exact test was used for the primary end point , and extended Mantel-Haenszel ( @ ) test was used for three PSA response categories .
RESULTS	The trial accrued @ eligible patients ( @ randomly assigned to each arm ) .
RESULTS	Patient characteristics were similar in both arms .
RESULTS	Undetectable PSA rate was @ ( @ % ) of @ for cixutumumab plus AD and @ ( @ % ) of @ for AD alone ( relative risk , @ ; one-sided P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Lower baseline CTCs ( @ v @ to @ v @/@ @ mL whole blood ) were associated with higher rate of PSA response ( three categories ; P = @ ) in @ evaluable patients .
RESULTS	IGF-IR biomarkers were not correlated with PSA outcome , and cixutumumab did not significantly change these biomarker levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Cixutumumab plus AD did not significantly increase the undetectable PSA rate in men with new metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	CTCs at baseline may carry prognostic value .

BACKGROUND	Infected necrotising pancreatitis is a potentially lethal disease that nearly always requires intervention .
BACKGROUND	Traditionally , primary open necrosectomy has been the treatment of choice .
BACKGROUND	In recent years , the surgical step-up approach , consisting of percutaneous catheter drainage followed , if necessary , by ( minimally invasive ) surgical necrosectomy has become the standard of care .
BACKGROUND	A promising minimally invasive alternative is the endoscopic transluminal step-up approach .
BACKGROUND	This approach consists of endoscopic transluminal drainage followed , if necessary , by endoscopic transluminal necrosectomy .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesise that the less invasive endoscopic step-up approach is superior to the surgical step-up approach in terms of clinical and economic outcomes .
METHODS	The TENSION trial is a randomised controlled , parallel-group superiority multicenter trial .
METHODS	Patients with ( suspected ) infected necrotising pancreatitis with an indication for intervention and in whom both treatment modalities are deemed possible , will be randomised to either an endoscopic transluminal or a surgical step-up approach .
METHODS	During a @year study period , @ patients will be enrolled from @ hospitals of the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group .
METHODS	The primary endpoint is a composite of death and major complications within @months following randomisation .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints include complications such as pancreaticocutaneous fistula , exocrine or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency , need for additional radiological , endoscopic or surgical intervention , the need for necrosectomy after drainage , the number of ( re - ) interventions , quality of life , and total direct and indirect costs .
CONCLUSIONS	The TENSION trial will answer the question whether an endoscopic step-up approach reduces the combined primary endpoint of death and major complications , as well as hospital stay and related costs compared with a surgical step-up approach in patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis .

OBJECTIVE	In this double-blind , randomized study , the authors compared the effects of a patient-controlled remifentanil and morphine combination with morphine alone on post-thoracotomy pain , analgesic consumption , and side effects .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , double-blind clinical study .
METHODS	University hospital .
METHODS	Volunteer patients at a university hospital undergoing elective thoracotomy surgery .
METHODS	Patients were allocated randomly into @ groups to receive patient-controlled analgesia : the morphine ( M ) group or the morphine plus remifentanil ( MR ) group .
METHODS	Pain , discomfort , sedation scores , cumulative patient-controlled morphine consumption , rescue analgesic ( meperidine ) requirement and side effects were recorded for @ hours .
RESULTS	Sixty patients were allocated randomly to receive intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine alone ( M ) or morphine plus remifentanil ( MR ) in a double-blind manner .
RESULTS	Patients were allowed to use bolus doses of morphine ( @ mg/kg ) or the same dose of a morphine plus remifentanil ( @ g/kg ) mixture every @ minutes without a background infusion .
RESULTS	VAS scores were lower in the MR group than in the M group at @ minutes ( p = @ ) , @ hour ( p = @ ) , and @ hours ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean cumulative doses of morphine were not significantly different at @ mg for the M group and @ mg for the MR group .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients needed meperidine in the M group ( p = @ ) ; these also experienced more nausea ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Coadministration of PCA remifentanil with morphine for the treatment of post-thoracotomy pain did not reduce morphine consumption but provided superior analgesia , less use of rescue analgesics , and fewer side effects compared to morphine alone .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of different maintenance recall intervals in patients with chronic periodontitis treated by full-mouth ultrasonic debridement .
METHODS	Twenty-eight patients participated in the study and were divided into two groups : group @ ( n = @ ) underwent full-mouth ultrasonic debridement followed by monthly supportive periodontal therapy ; group @ ( n = @ ) underwent full-mouth ultrasonic debridement followed by supportive periodontal therapy delivered at @-month intervals .
METHODS	Plaque index ( PI ) , bleeding on probing ( BOP ) , pocket probing depth ( PD ) , gingival recession ( GR ) and clinical attachment level ( CAL ) were evaluated at baseline and after @ and @ months .
RESULTS	Subjects in group @ had statistically significantly lower PI scores than did subjects in group @ at six months .
RESULTS	However , no differences in BOP , PPD , GR and CAL were observed between groups at any of the time points evaluated .
RESULTS	Nonetheless , while full-mouth BOP and PPD scores progressively decreased over time in group @ , the same parameters were significantly reduced at @ months in group @ , but remained stable thereafter .
RESULTS	The proportion of moderate and deep pockets decreased progressively over time in the group of monthly recalls , while the proportion of moderate to deep sites decreased significantly in group @ only at @ months ; no additional reductions were seen at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Supportive periodontal therapy both at one - and three-month intervals promotes short-term stability of clinical improvements obtained after full-mouth ultrasonic debridement in patients with chronic periodontitis .

BACKGROUND	It is well documented that heightened levels of parenting stress have a negative influence on children 's socio-emotional and behavioral development .
BACKGROUND	Parenting stress may therefore be regarded as an outcome variable in its own right .
BACKGROUND	This study investigated whether a sensitizing intervention influences stress reported by parents of prematurely born children until the children were age nine .
METHODS	Preterm infants ( N = @ , birth weight < @,@ g ) were randomized to intervention ( N = @ ) with the Mother-Infant Transaction Program ( MITP ) or a preterm control group ( N = @ ) that received standard hospital care .
METHODS	A term reference group comprised @ healthy , full-term neonates .
METHODS	Parents reported on the Parenting Stress Index ( PSI ) when the children were @ months , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ years old and on the PSI-Short Form ( PSI-SF ) at age @ .
METHODS	Main outcomes were the mother 's and father 's reports of total , child and parent-related stress .
METHODS	Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed using linear mixed models ( LMM ) , taking dependency in the data caused by twin pairs and repeated measures into account .
METHODS	Response rates were high across all follow-ups , and still reached @ % from mothers and @ % from fathers at @ years .
RESULTS	Mothers in the intervention group reported better longitudinal development of child-related stress than mothers of preterm controls , as they perceived their children as being more adaptable and less moody throughout childhood until the age of seven .
RESULTS	Less stress in the intervention group was revealed by cross-sectional analysis of maternal reports at all ages , while fathers reported similar differences at ages three and five .
RESULTS	Parents in the intervention group reported stronger agreement on several stress scores on several occasions .
RESULTS	Fathers with high interventional participation ( mean @ % ) reported significantly less stress at age nine than those who participated less .
RESULTS	Both parents in the intervention group reported levels of stress similar to those experienced by the term reference group at all follow-ups , while differences between the preterm control and term reference groups increased .
CONCLUSIONS	This early intervention reduces stress among parents of prematurely born children to a level reported by parents of term-born children and enhances agreement between parents .

BACKGROUND	Present combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) alone does not cure HIV infection and requires lifelong drug treatment .
BACKGROUND	The potential role of HIV therapeutic vaccines as part of an HIV cure is under consideration .
BACKGROUND	Our aim was to assess the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of Vacc-@x , a peptide-based HIV-@ therapeutic vaccine targeting conserved domains on p@ ( Gag ) , in adults infected with HIV-@ .
METHODS	Between July , @ , and June , @ , we did a multinational double-blind , randomised , phase @ study comparing Vacc-@x with placebo .
METHODS	Participants were adults infected with HIV-@ who were aged @-@ years and virologically suppressed on cART ( viral load < @ copies per mL ) with CD@ cell counts of @ @ ( @ ) cells per L or greater .
METHODS	The trial was done at @ sites in Germany , Italy , Spain , the UK , and the USA .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to Vacc-@x or placebo .
METHODS	Group allocation was masked from participants and investigators .
METHODS	Four primary immunisations , weekly for @ weeks , containing Vacc-@x ( or placebo ) were given intradermally after administration of adjuvant .
METHODS	Booster immunisations were given at weeks @ and @ .
METHODS	At week @ , cART was interrupted for up to @ weeks .
METHODS	The coprimary endpoints were cART resumption and changes in CD@ counts during treatment interruption .
METHODS	Analyses were by modified intention to treat : all participants who received one intervention .
METHODS	Furthermore , safety , viral load , and immunogenicity ( as measured by ELISPOT and proliferation assays ) were assessed .
METHODS	The @ week follow-up period was completed in June , @ .
METHODS	For the coprimary endpoints the proportion of participants who met the criteria for cART resumption was analysed with a logistic regression model with the treatment effect being assessed in a model including country as a covariate .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ individuals were screened ; because of slow recruitment , enrolment stopped with @ of a planned @ participants and @ were randomly assigned to receive Vacc-@x and @ to receive placebo .
RESULTS	There were no differences between the two groups for the primary efficacy endpoints in those participants who stopped cART at week @ .
RESULTS	Of the participants who resumed cART , @ ( @ % ) were in the Vacc-@x group and @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group , and percentage changes in CD@ counts were not significant ( mean treatment difference -@ , @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	However , a significant difference in viral load was noted for the Vacc-@x group both at week @ ( median @,@ copies per mL Vacc-@x vs @,@ copies per mL placebo ; p = @ ) and week @ ( median @,@ copies per mL vs @,@ copies per mL ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	One serious adverse event , exacerbation of multiple sclerosis , was reported as possibly related to study treatment .
RESULTS	Vacc-@x was immunogenic , inducing proliferative responses in both CD@ and CD@ T-cell populations .
CONCLUSIONS	The proportion of participants resuming cART before end of study and change in CD@ counts during the treatment interruption showed no benefit of vaccination .
CONCLUSIONS	Vacc-@x was safe , well tolerated , immunogenic , seemed to contribute to a viral-load setpoint reduction after cART interruption , and might be worth consideration in future HIV-cure investigative strategies .

OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to analyze the differences in ultrasound characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) originating in the thyroid isthmus versus that originating from the lobes .
METHODS	From a retrospective review of our institution 's database of records dated between January @ and December @ , we identified @ patients with classic PTCs located in the isthmus .
METHODS	All the patients had undergone preoperative ultrasound imaging , total thyroidectomy with bilateral central lymph node dissection , and postoperative follow-up for at least @ years .
METHODS	As a control group , @ patients with classic PTCs located in the lobe who had undergone total thyroidectomy with bilateral central lymph node dissection during the same period were randomly matched to the study patients for age , sex , and tumor size .
RESULTS	According to the clinicopathologic analyses , the incidence of extrathyroidal extension was higher in the patients with a tumor originating in the isthmus than in the control group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	According to the imaging analyses , the tumors originating in the isthmus more frequently had a circumscribed margin ( p = @ ) , a wider-than-tall shape ( p < @ ) , and the suspicion of extrathyroidal extension ( p < @ ) than those originating from the lobes .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study showed that PTCs originating in the isthmus were more likely to have extrathyroidal extension than those originating from the lobes .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , careful ultrasound evaluation should be performed on masses in the thyroid isthmus even if ultrasound shows a circumscribed mass with a wider-than-tall shape .

OBJECTIVE	The study was designed to determine whether response-based therapy improves outcomes in intermediate-risk Hodgkin lymphoma .
OBJECTIVE	We examined patterns of first relapse in the study .
METHODS	From September @ to July @ , @ patients < @ years old with stage I-IIA with bulk , I-IIAE , I-IIB , and IIIA-IVA with or without doxorubicin , bleomycin , vincristine , etoposide , prednisone , and cyclophosphamide were enrolled .
METHODS	Patients were categorized as rapid ( RER ) or slow early responders ( SER ) after @ cycles of doxorubicin , bleomycin , vincristine , etoposide , prednisone , and cyclophosphamide ( ABVE-PC ) .
METHODS	The SER patients were randomized to @ additional ABVE-PC cycles or augmented chemotherapy with @ Gy involved field radiation therapy ( IFRT ) .
METHODS	RER patients were stipulated to undergo @ additional ABVE-PC cycles and were then randomized to @ Gy IFRT or no further treatment if complete response ( CR ) was achieved .
METHODS	RER without CR patients were non-randomly assigned to @ Gy IFRT .
METHODS	Relapses were characterized without respect to site ( initial , new , or both ; and initial bulk or initial nonbulk ) , and involved field radiation therapy field ( in-field , out-of-field , or both ) .
METHODS	Patients were grouped by treatment assignment ( SER ; RER/no CR ; RER/CR/IFRT ; and RER/CR/no IFRT ) .
METHODS	Summary statistics were reported .
RESULTS	At @-year median follow-up , @ patients had experienced relapse , @ of whom were fully evaluable for review .
RESULTS	Those who progressed during treatment ( n = @ ) or lacked relapse imaging ( n = @ ) were excluded .
RESULTS	The median time to relapse was @ months .
RESULTS	Of the @ evaluable patients , @ % were RER/no CR , @ % were SER , @ % were RER/CR/no IFRT , @ % were RER/CR/IFRT , and @ % remained uncategorized .
RESULTS	The @ % and @ % relapses involved initially bulky and nonbulky sites , respectively .
RESULTS	First relapses rarely occurred at exclusively new or out-of-field sites .
RESULTS	By contrast , relapses usually occurred at nodal sites of initial bulky and nonbulky disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Although response-based therapy has helped define treatment for selected RER patients , it has not improved outcome for SER patients or facilitated refinement of IFRT volumes or doses .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the impact of intracoronary bolus administration of tirofiban combined with nitroprusside through thrombus aspiration catheter or thrombus aspiration alone on myocardial reperfusion and major adverse cardiovascular events rate in acute anterior myocardial infarction patients with heavy thrombosis burden .
METHODS	Ninety consecutive acute anterior myocardial infarction patients with heavy thrombosis burden -LSB- ( @ @ ) years old -RSB- were randomly assigned to thrombus aspiration group ( Group A , n = @ ) , thrombus aspiration and intracoronary tirofiban bolus ( @ g/kg prior to the first balloon inflation , Group B , n = @ ) , thrombus aspiration and intracoronary tirofiban combined with nitroprusside bolus ( @ g prior to the first balloon inflation , Group C , n = @ ) with random number table .
METHODS	Baseline clinical data , angiographic features before and after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) and major adverse cardiovascular events after PCI between @ groups were compared .
RESULTS	The baseline clinical data and angiographic features among @ groups were similar ( all P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The time of pain to balloon was ( @ @ ) hours .
RESULTS	After primary PCI , myocardial tissue perfusion was significantly better in Group C than in Group A and Group B : TMP grade < @ -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) vs. @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) , P < @ and P < @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Left ventricular ejection fraction at @ to @ days after PCI also tended higher in Group C than in the other @ groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	One patient died of heart failure at @th day after PCI in Group A , and no patient died in Group B and C. Thirty days after PCI , there was no re-myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization event among @ groups .
RESULTS	The bleeding complication rate during @ days follow-up was similar among @ groups ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intracoronary bolus application of tirofiban combined with nitroprusside through thrombus aspiration catheter after thrombus aspiration is associated with an improvement of myocardial reperfusion without increasing bleeding complication and other adverse cardiovascular events rate compared with thrombus aspiration alone in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction and heavy thrombosis burden undergoing primary PCI .

BACKGROUND	Lithium has proven suicide preventing effects in the long-term treatment of patients with affective disorders .
BACKGROUND	Clinical evidence from case reports indicate that this effect may occur early on at the beginning of lithium treatment .
BACKGROUND	The impact of lithium treatment on acute suicidal thoughts and/or behavior has not been systematically studied in a controlled trial .
BACKGROUND	The primary objective of this confirmatory study is to determine the association between lithium therapy and acute suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior in inpatients with a major depressive episode ( MDE , unipolar and bipolar disorder according to DSM IV criteria ) .
BACKGROUND	The specific aim is to test the hypothesis that lithium plus treatment as usual ( TAU ) , compared to placebo plus TAU , results in a significantly greater decrease in suicidal ideation and/or behavior over @weeks in inpatients with MDE .
METHODS	We initiated a randomized , placebo-controlled multicenter trial .
METHODS	Patients with the diagnosis of a moderate to severe depressive episode and suicidal thoughts and/or suicidal behavior measured with the Sheehan-Suicidality-Tracking Scale ( S-STS ) will be randomly allocated to add lithium or placebo to their treatment as usual .
METHODS	Change in the clinician administered S-STS from the initial to the final visit will be the primary outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	There is an urgent need to identify treatments that will acutely decrease suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study will demonstrate whether lithium reduces suicidal ideation and behavior within the first @weeks of treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To study the impact of impaired cerebral autoregulation on cortical neurophysiology , long term potentiation ( LTP ) - like plasticity , motor learning and brain structure .
METHODS	@ patients with unilateral occlusion or severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery were included .
METHODS	Impairment of cerebral autoregulation was determined by vasomotor reactivity in transcranial Doppler sonography .
METHODS	Corticomotor excitability , cortical silent period and LTP-like plasticity were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation , motor learning with a force production task , and brain structure with high-resolution MRI of the brain .
RESULTS	In the affected hemisphere , corticomotor excitability was significantly higher , cortical silent period and LTP-like plasticity significantly lower , compared to the contralateral side .
RESULTS	No significant difference emerged for motor learning , cortical thickness and white matter integrity between the hemispheres .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite decreased LTP-like plasticity in the affected hemisphere , motor learning was comparable between hemispheres , possibly due to gamma-aminobutyric-acid ( GABA ) B-mediated corticomotor excitability changes within the affected hemisphere .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results may help to develop interventions to beneficially modulate cortical physiology in the presence of cerebral hypoperfusion .

OBJECTIVE	Pain after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is severe , thus adequate pain control can be a challenge .
OBJECTIVE	Intrathecal morphine ( ITM ) provides excellent postoperative analgesia for TKA , but may have side effects .
OBJECTIVE	Femoral nerve block ( FNB ) also has been used for postoperative analgesia in TKA .
OBJECTIVE	We examined postoperative analgesia efficacy and side effects of ITM combined with single shot femoral nerve block ( SSFNB ) after TKA , over the dosage range of @ to @ mg .
METHODS	Sixty patients undergoing elective TKA received SSFNB ( @ % bupivacaine @ ml ) and spinal anesthesia with @ mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine ( @ % Heavy Marcaine ) were included in this study .
METHODS	They were randomized to receive ITM ( @ , @ , @ , and @ mg ) .
METHODS	A patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) device provided additional intravenous morphine .
METHODS	Morphine consumption , pain score , and side effects were recorded at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ hour postoperative .
METHODS	Patient satisfaction was rated at the @-hour postoperative visit .
RESULTS	Morphine consumption was significant higher in @ mg ITM group ( control ) than other groups , but there was no difference between ITM groups .
RESULTS	Pain score was significant lower in @ mg ITM group compared to @ mg at @ hour ( @ vs. @ , respectively ; p-value = @ ) and @ hour ( @ vs. @ , respectively ; p-value = @ ) postoperative period Side effects were not different in all groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study concluded that , low-dose ITM combination with SSFNB provided good pain relief with low side effects and reduced morphine consumption during the first @ hours post TKA .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) on esophageal peristalsis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) .
METHODS	Patients with GERD preliminary diagnosis were included in a randomized double-blind sham-controlled study .
METHODS	Esophageal manometry was performed before and during transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) of the right precentral cortex .
METHODS	Half of patients were randomly assigned to anodal , half to sham stimulation .
METHODS	Distal waves amplitude and pathological waves percentage were measured , after swallowing water boli , for ten subsequent times .
METHODS	Last , a @h pH-bilimetry was done to diagnose non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) or functional heartburn ( FH ) .
METHODS	The values obtained before and during anodal or sham tDCS were compared .
RESULTS	Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study .
RESULTS	Distal waves mean amplitude increased significantly only during anodal tDCS in NERD ( p = @ ) and FH subgroups ( p = @ ) while percentage of pathological waves strongly decreased only in NERDs ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Transcranial stimulation can influence cortical control of esophageal motility and improve pathological motor pattern in NERD and FH but not in erosive reflux disease ( ERD ) patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Pathophysiological processes in GERD are not only due to peripheral damage but to central neural control involvement as well .
CONCLUSIONS	In ERD patients dysfunctions of the cortico-esophageal circuit seem to be more severe and may affect central nervous system physiology .

OBJECTIVE	The wide heterogeneity in the early growth and metabolism of children born small for gestational age ( SGA ) , both before and during GH therapy , may reflect common genetic variations related to insulin secretion or sensitivity .
METHODS	Combined multiallele single nucleotide polymorphism scores with known associations with insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion were analyzed for their relationships with spontaneous postnatal growth and first-year responses to GH therapy in @ short SGA children .
RESULTS	The insulin sensitivity allele score ( GS-InSens ) was positively associated with spontaneous postnatal weight gain ( regression coefficient -LSB- B -RSB- : @ SD scores per allele ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and also in response to GH therapy with first-year height velocity ( B : @ cm/y per allele ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and change in IGF-@ ( B : @ SD scores per allele ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The association with first-year height velocity was independent of reported predictors of response to GH therapy ( adjusted P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The insulin secretion allele score ( GS-InSec ) was positively associated with spontaneous postnatal height gain ( B : @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and disposition index both before ( B : @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and after @ year of GH therapy ( B : @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , but not with growth and IGF-@ responses to GH therapy .
RESULTS	Neither of the allele scores was associated with size at birth .
CONCLUSIONS	Genetic allele scores indicative of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were associated with spontaneous postnatal growth and responses to GH therapy in short SGA children .
CONCLUSIONS	Further pharmacogenetic studies may support the rationale for adjuvant therapies by informing the mechanisms of treatment response .

BACKGROUND	Many new brands of hyaluronic acid ( HA ) fillers are being produced , but comparative research on the characteristics of similar products is limited .
OBJECTIVE	To test the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of a new HA filler , PP-@-B ( Cleviel Contour ; Pacific Pharma , Seoul , Korea ) , which is used for correcting nasolabial folds ( NLFs ) , and to compare the performance of PP-@-B with that of Restylane Perlane ( Q-Med ) .
METHODS	A total of @ subjects with visible NLFs were enrolled in this randomized , multicenter , patient/evaluator-blind , active-controlled , matched-pair clinical study .
METHODS	Each subject was injected with PP-@-B in @ NLF and Restylane Perlane in the other .
METHODS	All participants were reassessed for cosmetic changes at @ , @ , and @ weeks .
METHODS	Wrinkle severity was rated using the @-point Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale ( WSRS ) .
RESULTS	At Week @ , the mean improvement in the WSRS compared with baseline was @ @ for the PP-@-B side and @ @ for the Restylane Perlane side .
RESULTS	Both fillers were well tolerated , and adverse reactions were mild .
CONCLUSIONS	The new HA filler , PP-@-B , to the market , with suitable characteristics and ample safety profiles , will widen the selection of agents for physicians and patients because the purpose , area , and depth of filler injections vary .

OBJECTIVE	The effect of weight loss by diet or diet and exercise on salivary cortisol levels , a measure of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal activity , in overweight individuals is not known .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to test the hypothesis that @ weeks of moderate caloric restriction ( CR ) ( @ % ) by diet or diet and aerobic exercise would alter morning and diurnal salivary cortisol levels .
METHODS	Randomized control trial in an institutional research center .
METHODS	Thirty-five overweight ( BMI : @ kg/m ( @ ) ) but otherwise healthy participants ( @ M/@ F ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to either calorie restriction ( CR : @ % reduction in energy intake , n = @ ) , calorie restriction + exercise ( CR+EX : @ % reduction in energy intake +@ % increase in exercise energy expenditure , n = @ ) or control ( healthy weight-maintenance diet , n = @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	Salivary cortisol measured at @:@ , @:@ , @:@ , @:@ , @:@ , @:@ , @:@ and @:@ .
METHODS	Morning cortisol was defined as the mean cortisol concentration at @:@ and @:@ .
METHODS	Diurnal cortisol was calculated as the mean of the @ cortisol measures across the day .
RESULTS	In the whole cohort , higher morning and diurnal cortisol levels were associated with impaired insulin sensitivity ( morning : P = @ , r ( @ ) = @ ; diurnal : P = @ , r ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Using mixed model analysis , there was no significant effect of group , time or sex on morning or diurnal cortisol levels .
CONCLUSIONS	A @ % weight loss with a @ % CR diet alone or with exercise did not impact morning or diurnal salivary cortisol levels .

OBJECTIVE	This study investigates utilisation patterns for prescription opioid analgesics in the Australian community and how these are associated with a framework of individual-level factors related to healthcare use .
METHODS	Self-reported demographic and health information from participants in the @ and Up Study cohort were linked to pharmaceutical claims from @-@ .
METHODS	Participants comprised @,@ people with @ opioid analgesic dispensing in the @-months after recruitment to the cohort and @,@ people not dispensed opioid analgesics .
METHODS	All participants were aged @ years , were social security pharmaceutical beneficiaries , with no history of cancer .
METHODS	People dispensed opioid analgesics were classified as having acute ( dispensing period < @ days ) , episodic ( @ days and < @ ` authority ' prescriptions for increased quantity supply ) or long-term treatment ( @ days and @ authority prescriptions ) .
RESULTS	Of participants dispensed opioid analgesic @ % received acute treatment , @ % episodic treatment and @ % long-term treatment .
RESULTS	People dispensed opioid analgesics long-term had an average of @ opioid analgesic prescriptions/year from @ doctors compared with @ prescriptions from @ doctors for people receiving acute treatment .
RESULTS	People dispensed opioid analgesics reported more need-related factors such as poorer physical functioning and higher psychological distress .
RESULTS	Long-term users were more likely to have access-related factors such as low-income and living outside major cities .
RESULTS	After simultaneous adjustment , association with predisposing health factors and access diminished , but indicators of need such as osteoarthritis treatment , paracetamol use , and poor physical function were the strongest predictors for all opioid analgesic users .
CONCLUSIONS	People dispensed opioid analgesics were in poorer health , reported higher levels of distress and poorer functioning than people not receiving opioid analgesics .
CONCLUSIONS	Varying dispensing profiles were evident among people dispensed opioid analgesics for persistent pain , with those receiving episodic and long-term treatment dispensed the strongest opioid analgesics .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings highlight the broad range of factors associated with longer term opioid analgesics use .

OBJECTIVE	Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( P-PCI ) is the preferred reperfusion option in ST-elevation myocardial infarction , but its benefits become attenuated as time to its potential delivery becomes prolonged .
OBJECTIVE	Based on the STrategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial , we assessed the impact of increasing time delay on outcomes in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy ( PI ) or P-PCI .
METHODS	Thirty-day clinical outcomes were examined according to PCI-related delay ( P-RD ) .
METHODS	Data from hospitals that enrolled > @ randomised patients were used and P-RD categorised as @min , > @-@min and > @min .
RESULTS	Composite of death/congestive heart failure/cardiogenic shock/myocardial infarction in PI and P-PCI arms occurred in @ % versus @ % ( @min , p = @ ) ; @ % versus @ % ( > @-@min , p = @ ) and @ % versus @ % ( > @min , p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	While there was no worsening of outcomes for PI across the P-RD spectrum , this occurred in the P-PCI arm ( p ( trend ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	For P-RD @min , fewer events tended to occur with P-PCI than PI .
RESULTS	Conversely , as P-RD increased to > @min , PI-assigned patients had better outcomes than P-PCI , suggesting an event-free advantage with PI as P-RD increased ( p ( interaction ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Analysing P-RD continuously showed that for every @-min increment there was an increasing trend towards benefit among PI-assigned patients ( p ( interaction ) = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	As P-RD increased , PI outcomes became superior to P-PCI when P-RD is prolonged and exceeds guideline-mandated times .
CONCLUSIONS	In such circumstances , a PI strategy may provide an alternative reperfusion option .
CONCLUSIONS	Adverse time delays for delivery of P-PCI should be considered when evaluating reperfusion strategies .

OBJECTIVE	Bleeding after haemorrhoidectomy is common .
OBJECTIVE	Many surgical textbooks recommend insertion of an anal tampon in order to reduce postoperative bleeding .
OBJECTIVE	This practice , however , is bothersome and probably painful for patients .
OBJECTIVE	The effect of using a tamponade has not been validated in randomised controlled trials .
METHODS	The study included @ patients who were scheduled for Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy .
METHODS	During surgery , patients were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive an anal tampon at the end of the procedure .
METHODS	Data on pain , complications and wound care were collected .
METHODS	The trial was registered ( DRKS@ ) and all analyses were by intention-to-treat .
RESULTS	There were @ patients in the group with tamponade , and @ patients were left without tamponade .
RESULTS	The trial 's primary outcome and maximum pain intensity , averaged @ and @ in the two groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the group with tamponade , a complication was recorded in seven patients ( @ % ) , which was similar to the group without tamponade ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Severe anal bleeding occurred in two and five patients , respectively .
RESULTS	Bandage changes were less necessary often in the group treated without tamponade ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hospital stay was @ days in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Data indicate that insertion of an anal tampon after haemorrhoidectomy does not reduce postoperative bleeding but causes significantly more pain .
CONCLUSIONS	After haemorrhoidectomy , anal tampons should not be used routinely but may be considered when specific indications justify its use .

OBJECTIVE	Acute changes in social belonging are important triggers for alterations in health and well-being , yet research has emphasised the negative effects of ` exclusion ' at the expense of evaluating the potentially positive effects of ` inclusion ' .
OBJECTIVE	This study examined the impact of acute belonging on physiological and psychological outcomes .
METHODS	A healthy population ( N = @ ) were randomly allocated to ` included ' or ` excluded ' conditions .
METHODS	Condition-dependent differences in pre/during-task heart rate and pre/post-task self-reports of negative/positive mood , and social self-esteem , were assessed .
RESULTS	Included participants showed decreased heart rate and negative mood , and increased social self-esteem .
RESULTS	No inclusion-related change in positive mood was shown .
RESULTS	An increase in heart rate was observed in excluded participants though no changes in negative/positive mood or social self-esteem were shown .
RESULTS	Shifts in social self-esteem acted as a mechanism through which inclusion/exclusion impacted upon negative and positive mood alterations .
RESULTS	Results remained significant in presence of covariates ( sex , global self-esteem , rumination and social anxiety ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings suggest that acting to enhance belonging through ` inclusion ' resulted in adaptive physiological and psychological outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Neutral and potentially protective responses were observed in the immediate aftermath of ` exclusion ' .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-esteem served as one route through which these effects were transmitted .

BACKGROUND	In sub-Saharan Africa , the burden of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - associated tuberculosis is high .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a trial with a @-by-@ factorial design to assess the benefits of early antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , @-month isoniazid preventive therapy ( IPT ) , or both among HIV-infected adults with high CD@ + cell counts in Ivory Coast .
METHODS	We included participants who had HIV type @ infection and a CD@ + count of less than @ cells per cubic millimeter and who met no criteria for starting ART according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) guidelines .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups : deferred ART ( ART initiation according to WHO criteria ) , deferred ART plus IPT , early ART ( immediate ART initiation ) , or early ART plus IPT .
METHODS	The primary end point was a composite of diseases included in the case definition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , non-AIDS-defining cancer , non-AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease , or death from any cause at @ months .
METHODS	We used Cox proportional models to compare outcomes between the deferred-ART and early-ART strategies and between the IPT and no-IPT strategies .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ % with a baseline CD@ + count of @ cells per cubic millimeter ) were followed for @ patient-years .
RESULTS	A total of @ primary end-point events were observed ( @ events per @ person-years ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ) , including @ in patients with a baseline CD@ + count of at least @ cells per cubic millimeter ( @ events per @ person-years ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases accounted for @ % and @ % of primary end-point events , respectively .
RESULTS	The risk of death or severe HIV-related illness was lower with early ART than with deferred ART ( adjusted hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD@ + count of @ cells per cubic millimeter , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) and lower with IPT than with no IPT ( adjusted hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD@ + count of @ cells per cubic millimeter , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-month probability of grade @ or @ adverse events did not differ significantly among the strategies .
CONCLUSIONS	In this African country , immediate ART and @ months of IPT independently led to lower rates of severe illness than did deferred ART and no IPT , both overall and among patients with CD@ + counts of at least @ cells per cubic millimeter .

OBJECTIVE	Rosuvastatin and pitavastatin have been proposed as probe substrates for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) @B , but clinical data on their relative sensitivity and selectivity to OATP@B inhibitors are lacking .
OBJECTIVE	A clinical study was therefore conducted to determine their relative suitability as OATP@B probes using single oral ( PO ) and intravenous ( IV ) doses of the OATP@B inhibitor rifampicin , accompanied by a comprehensive in vitro assessment of rifampicin inhibitory potential on statin transporters .
METHODS	The clinical study comprised of two separate panels of eight healthy subjects .
METHODS	In each panel , subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of rosuvastatin ( @mg ) or pitavastatin ( @mg ) administered alone , concomitantly with rifampicin ( @mg ) PO or IV .
METHODS	The in vitro transporter studies were performed using hepatocytes and recombinant expression systems .
RESULTS	Rifampicin markedly increased exposures of both statins , with greater differential increases after POvs.IV rifampicin only for rosuvastatin .
RESULTS	The magnitudes of the increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve were @ - and @-fold for pitavastatin and @ - and @-fold for rosuvastatin , after PO and IV rifampicin , respectively .
RESULTS	In vitro studies showed that rifampicin was an inhibitor of OATP@B@ and OATP@B@ , breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistance protein @ , but not of organic anion transporter @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that pitavastatin is a more sensitive and selective and thus preferred clinical OATP@B probe substrate than rosuvastatin , and that a single IV dose of rifampicin is a more selective OATP@B inhibitor than a PO dose .

OBJECTIVE	The ARO @-@ trial primarily compared wait-and-see ( WS , arm A ) with adjuvant radiation therapy ( ART , arm B ) in prostate cancer patients who achieved an undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) after radical prostatectomy ( RP ) .
OBJECTIVE	Here , we report the outcome with up to @ years of follow-up of patients who retained a post-RP detectable PSA and received salvage radiation therapy ( SRT , arm C ) .
METHODS	For the study , @ patients with pT@-@pN@ prostate cancer with positive or negative surgical margins were recruited .
METHODS	After RP , @ men achieved an undetectable PSA ( arms A + B ) .
METHODS	In @ patients the PSA remained above thresholds ( median @ , range @-@ @ ng/mL ) .
METHODS	Of the latter , @ consented to receive @ Gy to the prostate bed , and SRT was applied at a median of @ days after RP .
METHODS	Clinical relapse-free survival , metastasis-free survival , and overall survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method .
RESULTS	Patients with persisting PSA after RP had higher preoperative PSA values , higher tumor stages , higher Gleason scores , and more positive surgical margins than did patients in arms A + B. For the @ patients , the @-year clinical relapse-free survival rate was @ % .
RESULTS	Forty-three men had hormone therapy ; @ experienced distant metastases ; @ patients died .
RESULTS	Compared with men who did achieve an undetectable PSA , the arm-C patients fared significantly worse , with a @-year metastasis-free survival of @ % versus @ % and overall survival of @ % versus @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	In Cox regression analysis , Gleason score @ ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ ) , pT @c ( HR @ ) , and extraprostatic extension @ mm ( HR @ ) were unfavorable risk factors of progression .
CONCLUSIONS	A persisting PSA after prostatectomy seems to be an important prognosticator of clinical progression for pT@ tumors .
CONCLUSIONS	It correlates with a higher rate of distant metastases and with worse overall survival .
CONCLUSIONS	A larger prospective study is required to determine which patient subgroups will benefit most from which treatment option .

OBJECTIVE	Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , is the most common degenerative joint disease .
OBJECTIVE	Several non-pharmacological interventions have been used for this purpose such as insoles .
OBJECTIVE	There are contradictory data about the superiority and effectiveness of laterally wedged compared with neutrally wedged insoles .
OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of laterally and neutrally wedged insoles in management of knee OA .
METHODS	In this double-blind , parallel treatment trial , @ patients with knee OA according to American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria were enrolled and were followed for @months .
METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into two groups .
METHODS	Fifty-seven of them were treated with @ laterally elevated wedged insoles ( group A ) and @ patients were treated with neutrally wedged insoles ( group B ) .
METHODS	Edinburg Knee Functional Scale ( EKFS ) was used to evaluate knee function before and after interventions .
METHODS	At the end of @months , severity of knee pain during the previous @days , numbers of non-steroid anti inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) used for pain relief within the last @weeks and EKFS were assessed .
RESULTS	Severity of knee pain decreased in both groups after intervention .
RESULTS	The mean difference in groups A ( laterally wedged insole ) and B ( neutrally wedged insole ) were @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- : @ , @ ) and @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) , respectively ( P < @ for both ) .
RESULTS	In addition , at the end of the study , EKFS improved significantly in group A ( mean : @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ; P < @ ) , while in group B we could not find significant improvement ( mean : @ , @ % CI : -@ , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Numbers of NSAIDs used during the two final weeks of the study significantly decreased compared with baseline in group A ( P = @ ; mean : @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) ; while in group B this was not shown ( P = @ ; mean : @ , @ % CI : -@ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that laterally elevated wedged insoles are more effective than neutrally wedged insoles , in pain relief of knee OA .

METHODS	A prospective randomized controlled trial .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the efficacy of neurophysiological monitoring during general anesthesia with either a total intravenous technique or with the volatile anesthetic agent , desflurane .
BACKGROUND	A total intravenous anesthetic technique is generally chosen when neurophysiological monitoring is used as it has been shown to facilitate such monitoring .
BACKGROUND	Despite this , with prolonged infusions of propofol , prolonged awakening times may be seen , which may impact the time required for postoperative neurological assessment or more importantly result in significant delays , should a wake-up test become necessary .
BACKGROUND	To date , there are no prospective trials comparing intravenous techniques with a volatile agent-based anesthetic technique and its effects on neurophysiological monitoring .
METHODS	This prospective study compares somatosensory evoked potential and motor evoked potential monitoring during posterior spinal fusion in @ adolescents .
METHODS	The patients were randomized to receive a total intravenous technique with propofol-remifentanil or a volatile agent-based technique with desflurane-remifentanil .
RESULTS	The groups were similar with regard to age , weight , height , body mass index , Cobb angle , and distribution of Lenke classifications .
RESULTS	No differences were noted in anesthesia time , surgery time , intraoperative fluids , or estimated blood loss between the @ groups .
RESULTS	Time to eye opening , time to following commands , and time to tracheal extubation were shorter in the volatile anesthesia group than the total intravenous anesthesia group .
RESULTS	No clinically significant difference was noted in the amplitude or latency of somatosensory evoked potential monitoring .
RESULTS	Although statistically significantly greater voltage amplitude was required to generate a motor evoked potential , the voltage amount was within a clinically acceptable range .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data demonstrate that a volatile agent-based anesthetic regimen is feasible even during neurophysiological monitoring .
CONCLUSIONS	Advantages include a more rapid awakening and the feasibility of a rapid wake-up test ( < @ min ) in the event that irreversible changes in neurophysiological monitoring are noted .

OBJECTIVE	This randomized trial aimed to evaluate the effects of adding continuous epidural analgesia with a bupivacaine and hydromorphone solution to systemic multimodal analgesia following one - or two-level lumbar spinal fusion .
METHODS	Thirty-nine patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion , stratified for sex and one - or two-level fusion , were randomized to receive a continuous postoperative epidural infusion of either @ % bupivacaine with @gmL ( -@ ) hydromorphone ( LA group ) or @ % saline ( NS group ) at @mLhr ( -@ ) for @hr through an epidural catheter placed intraoperatively .
METHODS	All patients received a standardized postoperative multimodal analgesia regimen .
METHODS	Patients , healthcare providers , and research staff were blinded .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was cumulative opioid consumption ( oral morphine equivalent ) during the first @hr postoperatively .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) cumulative opioid consumption @hours postoperatively was @ ( @ ) mg in the NS group and @ ( @ ) mg in the LA group ( mean difference @ mg ; @ % confidence interval -@ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no adverse events in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	Continuous epidural infusion combined with systemic multimodal analgesia resulted in a mean reduction in @-hr cumulative opioid consumption of @ mg ( @ % confidence interval -@ to @ ) following one - or two-level lumbar spinal fusion .
CONCLUSIONS	This estimate of effect is imprecise , and the routine use of continuous epidural analgesia in this surgical population is not yet warranted .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Olive oil protects against cardiovascular disease but the underlying mechanism is still unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We speculated that olive oil could inhibitoxidative stress , which is believed to be implicated in the atherosclerotic process .
RESULTS	Post-prandial oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction were investigated in twenty-five healthy subjects who were randomly allocated in a cross-over design to a Mediterranean diet added with or without extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO , @g ) ( first study , n = @ ) or Mediterranean diet with EVOO ( @g ) or corn oil ( @g ) ( second study , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Oxidative stress biomarkers including platelet reactive oxidant species ( ROS ) and @-iso-PGF@-III , activity of NOX@ , the catalytic sub-unit of NADPH oxidase , as assessed in platelets and serum , serum vitamin E and endothelial dysfunction , were measured before and @h after lunch .
RESULTS	In the first study a significant increase of platelet ROS , @-iso-PGF@-III , NOX@ activity , sE-selectin , sVCAM@ and a decrease of serum vitamin E were detected in controls but not when EVOO was included in the Mediterranean diet ; oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction increase were also observed in the second study in subjects given corn oil .
RESULTS	A significant correlation was found between NOX@ activity and platelet oxidative stress .
RESULTS	Invitro study demonstrated that EVOO but not corn oil significantly decreased platelet and PMNs oxidative stress and NOX@ activity .
CONCLUSIONS	The study provides the first evidence that post-prandial oxidative stress may be triggered by NOX@ up-regulation .
CONCLUSIONS	EVOO but not corn oil , is able to counteract such phenomenon suggesting that addition of EVOO to a Mediterranean diet protects against post-prandial oxidative stress .

BACKGROUND	Failed intubation may result in both increased morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	The combination of a video laryngoscope and a flexible tracheoscope used as a flexible video stylet may improve the success rate of securing a difficult airway .
BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that this combination is a feasible way to facilitate intubation in patients with a predicted difficult airway in that it will shorten intubation times and reduce the number of intubation attempts .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , prospective trial in @ patients with anticipated difficult airways undergoing elective or urgent surgery .
METHODS	After insertion of video laryngoscope , patients were randomly assigned to either having their tube placed with the use of a preformed stylet ( control group ) or with a flexible tracheoscope ( intervention group ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were time to successful intubation and number of intubation attempts .
RESULTS	The number of intubations requiring @ or more intubation attempts was similar in the @ groups ( @ % control vs @ % intervention , P = @ ) ; the number of patients requiring @ or more intubation attempts was not significantly different ( @ % control vs @ % intervention , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control ( median of @ seconds , interquartile range @-@ ) and the intervention group ( median of @ seconds , interquartile range @-@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the control group , @ patients , all with cervical spine pathology , had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after @ failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet .
RESULTS	For these @ patients , time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was @ @ seconds .
RESULTS	Overall success probability for cervical spine patients was @ % ( @/@ ) in the intervention group and @ % ( @/@ ) in the control group , with an exact @ % confidence interval for the difference of @ % to @ % , P = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways .
CONCLUSIONS	A flexible tracheoscope used in combination with video laryngoscope may also further increase the success rate of intubation in select patients with a proven difficult airway , particularly when in-line stabilization is required .

BACKGROUND	Hypomethylating agents have demonstrated activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
BACKGROUND	Preclinical and single-arm trials have suggested that adding histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors may synergize the epigenetic modulation of hypomethylating agents and improve treatment results .
METHODS	The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of adding valproic acid , an HDAC inhibitor , to decitabine in the treatment of MDS and AML .
RESULTS	Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged @ years were eligible .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized in a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine @ mg/m ( @ ) daily for @ days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid @ mg/kg daily for @ days .
RESULTS	Courses were repeated every @ to @ weeks .
RESULTS	A maximum of @ patients were to be treated .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients were treated on study , including @ patients with MDS and @ patients with AML .
RESULTS	The median patient age was @ years ( range , @-@ years ; @ % of patients were aged @ years ) .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % of patients achieved complete remission , and @ % had an objective response .
RESULTS	The median survival was @ months , and the estimated @-year survival rate was @ % .
RESULTS	Outcome was not different with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission , overall response , or survival .
RESULTS	Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories .
RESULTS	Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher with the combination arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML .
CONCLUSIONS	Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents with better HDAC inhibitors and using different schedules .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects and short-term outcomes of pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee versus synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation in the weaning phase of very low-birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome .
METHODS	Randomized controlled prospective study .
METHODS	Tertiary care neonatal unit .
METHODS	A total of @ premature infants who were less than @ weeks ' gestation and/or less than @,@ g birth weight and received mechanical ventilation because of respiratory distress syndrome were studied .
METHODS	All infants were ventilated from the time of admission with synchronized intermittent positive pressure ventilation mode after surfactant treatment for respiratory distress syndrome and then switched to pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation mode in the weaning phase .
METHODS	The ventilatory variables and neonatal outcomes were recorded in each group .
RESULTS	The mean peak inflation pressure was higher in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation group ( p < @ ) and the mean airway pressure was higher in pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee group ( p = @ ) , whereas mean tidal volume and respiratory rates were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	The prevalence of postextubation atelectasis was higher in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation group , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences were found in the prevalence of reintubation , patent ductus arteriosus , intraventricular hemorrhage , retinopathy of prematurity , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , and pneumothorax between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee mode may be a safe and feasible mode during the weaning phase of very low-birth weight infants on mechanical ventilation support for respiratory distress syndrome with respect to reducing the frequency of postextubation atelectasis and using less peak inflation pressure .

METHODS	The p-EVES study is a prospective two-arm randomised cross-over trial to test the hypothesis that , in comparison to optical LVAs , p-EVES can be : used for longer duration ; used for a wider range of tasks than a single optical LVA and/or enable users to do tasks that they were not able to do with optical LVAs ; allow faster performance of instrumental activities of daily living ; and allow faster reading .
METHODS	A total of @ adult participants with visual impairment are currently being recruited from Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and randomised into either Group @ ( receiving the two interventions A and B in the order AB ) , or Group @ ( receiving the two interventions in the order BA ) .
METHODS	Intervention A is a @-month period with conventional optical LVAs and a p-EVES device , and intervention B is a @-month period with conventional optical LVAs only .
RESULTS	The study adopts a mixed methods approach encompassing a broad range of outcome measures .
RESULTS	The results will be obtained from the following primary outcome measures : Manchester Low Vision Questionnaire , capturing device ` usage ' data ( which devices are used , number of times , for what purposes , and for how long ) and the MNRead test , measuring threshold print size , critical print size , and acuity reserve in addition to reading speed at high ( @ % ) contrast .
RESULTS	Results will also be obtained from a series of secondary outcome measures which include : assessment of timed instrumental activities of daily living and a ` near vision ' visual functioning questionnaire .
RESULTS	A companion qualitative study will permit comparison of results on how , where , and under what circumstances , p-EVES devices and LVAs are used in daily life .
RESULTS	A health economic evaluation will provide results on : the incremental cost-effectiveness of p-EVES compared to optical magnifiers ; cost-effectiveness ; and cost-utility .
CONCLUSIONS	The evidence base in low vision rehabilitation is modest and further high quality clinical trials are required to inform decisions on healthcare provision .
CONCLUSIONS	The p-EVES study findings are anticipated to contribute to this broader evidence requirement , with the methodological issues evident here being relevant to other trials within the field .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to determine the utilization and outcomes for radial access for percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) for ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) in common practice .
BACKGROUND	Radial access for PCI has been studied considerably , but mostly in clinical trials .
METHODS	All patients undergoing PCI for STEMI in @ to @ in New York were studied to determine the frequency and the patient-level predictors of radial access .
METHODS	Differences in in-hospital/@-day mortality between radial and femoral access were also studied .
RESULTS	Radial access increased from @ % in the first quarter of @ to @ % in the last quarter of @ .
RESULTS	Significant independent predictors were higher body surface area , non-Hispanic ethnicity , Caucasian race , stable hemodynamic state , ejection fraction < @ % and @ % onset of STEMI from @to @ h before the index procedure , and peripheral vascular disease .
RESULTS	Mortality was not related to access site after adjustment for covariates ( for radial vs. femoral access , adjusted odds ratio : @ , @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ) , but the radial access site was trending toward lower mortality for the @ hospitals that used it for more than @ % of their patients ( adjusted odds ratio : @ , @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a radial access site for PCI in STEMI patients increased between @ and @ , but was still infrequent in @ , and was used for lower-risk STEMI patients .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no significant difference in mortality by access site , but there was a trend toward a mortality advantage for patients with a radial access site among hospitals that used it relatively frequently .

BACKGROUND	The impact of educational strategies in the management of adverse treatment effects and drug interactions in adult patients with epilepsy with comorbidities remains undetermined .
OBJECTIVE	The EDU-COM study is a randomised , pragmatic trial investigating the effect of a patient-tailored educational plan in patients with epilepsy with comorbidity .
METHODS	@ adult patients with epilepsy with chronic comorbidities , multiple-drug therapy and reporting at least one adverse treatment effect and/or drug interaction at study entry were randomly assigned to the educational plan or usual care .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the number of patients becoming free from adverse treatment events and/or drug interactions after a @-month follow-up .
METHODS	The number of adverse treatment events and drug interactions , health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) summary score changes and the monetary costs of medical contacts and drugs were assessed as secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was met by @ % of patients receiving the educational plan versus @ % of those on usual care ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The control group reported a significantly higher risk not to meet successfully the primary endpoint at the end of the study : OR ( @ % CI ) of @ ( @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	A separate analysis on drug adverse effects and drug interactions showed that the latter were more sensitive to the effect of educational treatment .
RESULTS	Quality of life and costs were not significantly different in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	A patient-tailored educational strategy is effective in reducing drug-related problems ( particularly drug interactions ) in epilepsy patients with chronic comorbidities , without adding significant monetary costs .
CONCLUSIONS	Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT@ , ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) .

BACKGROUND	An emerging field of research describes the role of preoperative health behaviours , known as prehabilitation .
BACKGROUND	The preoperative period may be a more physically and emotionally salient time to introduce and foster chronic adherence to health behaviours , such as exercise , in patients compared to post-treatment during recovery .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , physical and psychosocial improvements during the preoperative period may translate into an enhanced recovery trajectory with reduced operative complications and postoperative adverse effects .
BACKGROUND	No studies have assessed prehabilitation for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy .
METHODS	This is a multi-centre , pilot randomized control trial conducted at two Canadian urban teaching hospitals .
METHODS	@ men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with no contraindications to exercise will be recruited and randomized to the prehabiliation program or usual care .
METHODS	Prehabilitation participants will engage in a preoperative , individualized exercise program including pelvic floor muscle strengthening instructions and a healthy lifestyle guide for men with prostate cancer .
METHODS	These participants will be asked to engage in @ minutes of home-based , unsupervised , moderate-intensity exercise on @-@ days per week .
METHODS	Usual care participants will receive the same pelvic floor muscle strengthening instructions and healthy lifestyle guide only .
METHODS	We will assess the feasibility of conducting an adequately powered trial of the same design via recruitment rate , programmatic adherence/contamination , attrition , and safety .
METHODS	Estimates of intervention efficacy will be captured through measurements at baseline ( @-@ weeks preoperatively ) , within @ week prior to surgery , and postoperatively at @ , @ , and @ weeks .
METHODS	Efficacy outcomes include : fatigue , quality of life , urinary incontinence , physical fitness , body composition , aerobic fitness , pain , and physical activity volume .
CONCLUSIONS	The primary outcome of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale , randomized controlled trial of prehabilitation versus usual care and to estimate effect sizes that will inform sample size determinations for subsequent trials in this field .
CONCLUSIONS	To our knowledge , this is the first study to examine a structured presurgical exercise program for men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial will advance our understanding of strategies to efficiently and effectively use the preoperative period to optimize postoperative recovery .

BACKGROUND	Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is associated with poor outcome after surgery .
BACKGROUND	The prevalence of DM in hospitalised patients is up to @ % , meaning that the anaesthesiologist will encounter a patient with DM in the operating room on a daily basis .
BACKGROUND	Despite an abundance of published glucose lowering protocols and the known negative outcomes associated with perioperative hyperglycaemia in DM , there is no evidence regarding the optimal intraoperative glucose lowering treatment .
BACKGROUND	In addition , protocol adherence is usually low and protocol targets are not simply met .
BACKGROUND	Recently , incretins have been introduced to lower blood glucose .
BACKGROUND	The main hormone of the incretin system is glucagon-like peptide-@ ( GLP-@ ) .
BACKGROUND	GLP-@ increases insulin and decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner , resulting in glucose lowering action with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia .
BACKGROUND	We set out to determine the optimal intraoperative treatment algorithm to lower glucose in patients with DM type @ undergoing non-cardiac surgery , comparing intraoperative glucose-insulin-potassium infusion ( GIK ) , insulin bolus regimen ( BR ) and GPL-@ ( liragludite , LG ) treatment .
METHODS	This is a multicentre randomised open label trial in patients with DM type @ undergoing non-cardiac surgery .
METHODS	Patients are randomly assigned to one of three study arms ; intraoperative glucose-insulin-potassium infusion ( GIK ) , intraoperative sliding-scale insulin boluses ( BR ) or GPL-@ pre-treatment with liraglutide ( LG ) .
METHODS	Capillary glucose will be measured every hour .
METHODS	If necessary , in all study arms glucose will be adjusted with an intravenous bolus of insulin .
METHODS	Researchers , care givers and patients will not be blinded for the assigned treatment .
METHODS	The main outcome measure is the difference in median glucose between the three study arms at @ hour postoperatively .
METHODS	We will include @ patients , which gives us a @ % power to detect a @ mmol l ( -@ ) difference in glucose between the study arms .
CONCLUSIONS	The PILGRIM trial started in January @ and will provide relevant information on the perioperative use of GLP-@ agonists and the optimal intraoperative treatment algorithm in patients with diabetes mellitus type @ .

OBJECTIVE	Pharmacologic treatment for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) is critical to prevent adverse clinical outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	In a randomized controlled trial , we compared antiplatelet and statin adherence among patients with CHD who received : ( @ ) text messages ( TM ) for medication reminders and education , ( @ ) educational TM only , or ( @ ) No TM .
METHODS	A mobile health intervention delivered customized TM for @ days .
METHODS	We assessed and analyzed medication adherence with electronic monitoring devices -LSB- Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) -RSB- by one-way ANOVA and Welch tests , two-way TM response rates by t-tests , and self-reported adherence ( Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ) by Repeated Measures ANOVA .
RESULTS	Among @ patients ( @ % male , mean age @ years ) , MEMS revealed patients who received TM for antiplatelets had a higher percentage of correct doses taken ( p = @ ) , percentage number of doses taken ( p = @ ) , and percentage of prescribed doses taken on schedule ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	TM response rates were higher for antiplatelets than statins ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Self-reported adherence revealed no significant differences among groups .
CONCLUSIONS	TM increased adherence to antiplatelet therapy demonstrated by MEMS and TM responses .
CONCLUSIONS	Feasibility and high satisfaction were established .
CONCLUSIONS	Mobile health interventions show promise in promoting medication adherence .

OBJECTIVE	To study the impacts of electroacupuncture ( EA ) on memory impairment after cerebral infarction through the observation of hydrogen proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( @H-MRS ) of brain tissue metabolites in the patients of cerebral infarction .
METHODS	Sixty cases of memory impairment after cerebral infarction were randomized into an observation group and a control group , @ cases in each one .
METHODS	The conventional rehabilitation training and medication were applied to all the patients .
METHODS	In the observation group , beside the basic treatment , EA was applied to bilateral Ezhongxian ( MS @ ) , Dingzhongxian ( MS @ ) , Dingniehouxiexian ( MS @ ) , Hegu ( LI @ ) , Taichong ( LR @ ) , Zusanli ( ST @ ) , Taixi ( KI @ ) , Xuanzhong ( GB @ ) and Fengchi ( GB @ ) .
METHODS	The treatment was given once a day , @ times a week , for @ weeks .
METHODS	The clinical memory scale was used for the score evaluation before and after treatment in all the patients .
METHODS	The magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) and @H-MRS scanning were applied to the head .
METHODS	The ratio of N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) and creatine ( Cr ) and the ratio of choline ( Cho ) and Cr were determined in the foci of cerebral infarction .
RESULTS	Eight weeks later , the scores of clinical memory scale were all increased after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two group ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The ratio of NAA and Cr was increased as compared with that before treatment ( P < @ ) ; the ratio of Cho and Cr was reduced as compared with that before treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The changes in the observation group were more obvious than those in the control group ( all P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	On the basis of the conventional medication and rehabilitation training , EA improves the metabolism of brain tissue and memory function of the patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy of this therapy is better than that of medication combined with rehabilitation training .

BACKGROUND	Vasovagal syncope ( VVS ) represents by far the most common cause of syncope as it is diagnosed in around @ % of all patients that come to an emergency department .
BACKGROUND	Although VVS is not fatal , it can cause an injury .
BACKGROUND	Even serious injuries are not common , but there are reports of serious injuries of up to @ % .
BACKGROUND	There are no current studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of any treatment .
BACKGROUND	Past studies found that an Anti-Gravity suit ( G-suit ) can increase blood pressure and has been reported to prevent orthostatic hypotension effectively in patients with diabetes .
BACKGROUND	It is possible that the G-suit can prevent VVS .
OBJECTIVE	In the present study , the authors assessed the efficacy of G-suit for vasovagal syncope prevention .
METHODS	In this open-label , randomized controlled study , we used the Italian tilt protocol , namely @ degree passive tilting followed by @ mg nitroglycerin challenge when the passive phase fails to induce syncope .
METHODS	If test was positive , then patient was enrolled .
METHODS	Tilt table test was repeated to compare G-suited and no G-suited to assess efficacy of G-suit for vasovagal syncope prevention .
RESULTS	@ patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	There is no difference between the control group and an experimental group .
RESULTS	In this study there is no cardio-inhibition vasovagal syncope .
RESULTS	Positive tilt table test occurred in @ % of the patients receiving G-suited and @ % in control group ( p @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	G-suit is unable to prevent syncope in patients with positive tilt table test but the result is not statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the number of patients may be too small .

BACKGROUND	Hearing-impaired listeners localize sounds better unaided than aided .
BACKGROUND	Wide dynamic range compression circuits operating independently at each ear in bilateral fittings , and microphone positions of different hearing aid styles , have been cited as a reason .
BACKGROUND	Two hearing aid features , inter-ear coordinated compression ( IE ) and pinna compensation ( PC ) , were developed to mitigate the compromised aided localization performance .
OBJECTIVE	This study examined the effect of IE and PC on aided localization performance in the horizontal plane with hearing-impaired listeners .
METHODS	A single-blind , repeated-measures design was used .
METHODS	A total of @ experienced hearing aid users with bilaterally symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss who had previously participated in localization training were evaluated .
METHODS	Localization performance was measured using @ loudspeakers spaced @ apart on the horizontal plane .
METHODS	Aided performance was evaluated using a behind-the-ear hearing aid at four settings : omnidirectional microphone ( Omni ) , Omni microphone with the PC feature , Omni microphone with IE , and Omni microphone with the PC feature and IE together .
METHODS	In addition , unaided localization performance was measured .
RESULTS	Significant improvement in the localization accuracy was measured for sounds arriving from the back when comparing the PC with the Omni conditions .
RESULTS	The use of IE reduced the magnitude of errors for some listeners for sounds originating from @ .
RESULTS	The average reduction in the errors was @ .
CONCLUSIONS	This study confirmed that the use of the PC feature improved localization for sounds arriving from behind the listener .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of IE may improve localization for some listeners for sounds arriving from the sides .

BACKGROUND	On the Internet , people share personal experiences as well as facts and objective information .
BACKGROUND	This also holds true for the exchange of health-related information in a variety of Internet forums .
BACKGROUND	In online discussions about health topics , both fact-oriented and strongly personal contributions occur on a regular basis .
OBJECTIVE	In this field experiment , we examined in what way the particular type of contribution ( ie , factual information vs personal experiences ) has an impact on the subsequent communication in health-related Internet forums .
METHODS	For this purpose , we posted parallelized queries to @ comparable Internet forums ; queries were identical with regard to the information contained but included either fact-oriented descriptions or personal experiences related to measles vaccination .
METHODS	In the factual information condition , we posted queries to the forums that contained the neutral summary of a scientific article .
METHODS	In the personal experiences condition , we posted queries to the forums that contained the same information as in the first condition , but were framed as personal experiences
RESULTS	We found no evidence that personal experiences evoked more responses ( mean @ , SD @ ) from other members of the Internet forums than fact-oriented contributions ( mean @ , SD @ , t@ = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	But personal experiences elicited emotional replies ( mean @ , SD @ ) from other users to a greater extent than fact-oriented contributions ( mean @ , SD @ , t@ = @ , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We suggest that personal experiences elicited more emotional replies due to the process of emotional anchoring of people 's own style of communication .
CONCLUSIONS	We recommend future studies should aim at testing the hypotheses with more general and with less emotionally charged topics , constructing different fact-oriented posts , and examining additional potential factors of influence such as personality factors or particular communication situations .

OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that trained nurse endoscopists are not inferior to medical endoscopists in finding adenomas during colonoscopy .
METHODS	This is a prospective , randomised , single-blind , non-inferiority study comparing nurses with medical endoscopists in performing screening colonoscopy .
METHODS	The nurse endoscopists had been trained according to the British Joint Advisory Group on GI Endoscopy curriculum and had completed at least @ colonoscopic procedures prior to the study .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the adenoma detection rate .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included the caecal intubation rate , intubation time , complication rate , patient pain and satisfaction scores .
RESULTS	We enrolled and analysed a total of @ patients over a @-month period .
RESULTS	At least one adenoma was found in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients by nurse endoscopists and @ ( @ % ) of @ patients by medical endoscopists and a proportion difference of +@ % compared with the medical endoscopists ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	The withdrawal time was , however , significantly longer among nurses ( @ vs @ s , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjusting for differences in a regression analysis , colonoscopy by nurses was associated with a lower adenoma detection rate ( OR @ : @ % CI @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Nurse endoscopists had a lower caecal intubation rate ( @ % vs @ % ) , received better pain and satisfaction scores and had a high rate of patient acceptance .
CONCLUSIONS	In this pragmatic trial , nurses can perform screening colonoscopy but require a longer procedural time to achieve a comparable adenoma detection rate as medical endoscopists .

BACKGROUND	Invasive fungal infections are very severe infections associated with high mortality rates , despite the availability of new classes of antifungal agents .
BACKGROUND	Based on pathophysiological mechanisms and limited pre-clinical and clinical data , adjunctive immune-stimulatory therapy with interferon-gamma ( IFN - ) may represent a promising candidate to improve outcome of invasive fungal infections by enhancing host defence mechanisms .
METHODS	In this open-label , prospective case series , we describe eight patients with invasive Candida and/or Aspergillus infections who were treated with recombinant IFN - ( rIFN - , @ g s.c. , thrice a week ) for @ weeks in addition to standard antifungal therapy .
RESULTS	Recombinant IFN - treatment in patients with invasive Candida and/or Aspergillus infections partially restored immune function , as characterized by an increased HLA-DR expression in those patients with a baseline expression below @ % , and an enhanced capacity of leukocytes from treated patients to produce proinflammatory cytokines involved in antifungal defence .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study provides evidence that adjunctive immunotherapy with IFN - can restore immune function in fungal sepsis patients , warranting future clinical studies to assess its potential clinical benefit .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the feasibility of using an ultra-low dose ( @ mmol/kg of body weight -LSB- BW -RSB- ) of high relaxivity contrast agent for late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) imaging in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .
METHODS	@ consecutive patients ( mean age , @ @ years ) with ST-segment elevation AMI underwent two randomized cardiac magnetic resonance studies ( exam intervals between @ and @h ) on a @ T unit during the first week after the event using gadobenate dimeglumine ( Gd-BOPTA ) at the dose of @ mmol/kg BW ( standard dose or SD group ) and @ mmol/kg BW ( half dose or HD group ) .
METHODS	Image quality was qualitatively assessed .
METHODS	Quantitative analysis of LGE were performed by measuring signal intensity ( SI ) , signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) in the infarcted myocardium ( IM ) , non-infarcted myocardium ( N-IM ) and left ventricular cavity ( LVC ) in images acquired at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ min after administration of Gd-BOPTA using both contrast media protocol .
METHODS	Contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) between IM and N-IM ( CNR IM/N-IM ) and between IM and LVC ( CNR IM/LVC ) were also quantified for each time point .
METHODS	Moreover the extent of infarcted myocardium was measured .
RESULTS	@ LGE images were evaluated for each dose group .
RESULTS	Quality score was significantly higher for SD at @ , @ and @ min ( @ < p < @ ) and for HD at @ min ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	SNR has been higher in the SD group compared to the HD group even though not statistically significant at any time-point for both IM ( SD vs. HD : @ @ vs. @ @ ; @ < p < @ ) and N-IM ( SD vs. HD : @ @ vs. @ @ ; @ < p < @ ) .
RESULTS	LVC SNR was significantly higher with SD at @ min ( p = @ ) , @ min ( p = @ ) and @ min ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	CNR between the IM and N-IM was significantly higher using SD compared to HD ( @ @ vs. @ @ ; @ < p < @ ) at @ , @ and @ min .
RESULTS	No significant differences in CNR IM/LVC were noted for HD acquired @ min after CM administration compared to SD acquired at @ ( p = @ ) , @ ( p = @ ) and @ ( p = @ ) min , and between HD at @ min compared to SD acquired at @ min ( p = @ ) and @ min ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Good correlation between SD and HD ( @ < r ( @ ) < @ , p < @ ) was found at all time-points in the measuring of IA .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a @ mmol/kg dose of gadobenate dimeglumine is feasible for LGE imaging of acute MI and the best image quality is obtained at @ min after contrast administration .
CONCLUSIONS	It could be beneficial in patient with renal failure and a solution to improve the identification of subendocardial infarction reducing examination time , costs and total gadolinium load .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the standard dose of @ mmol/kg provides overall better image quality , with the best performance obtained at the delay of @ min or more after Gd-BOPTA administration , and it should be routinely preferred .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of olive oil and flaxseed oil compared with mineral oil for the treatment of constipation in patients undergoing hemodialysis .
METHODS	A @-week , double-blind , randomized , and controlled trial was conducted .
METHODS	Fifty constipated patients ( @ % male , @years ) diagnosed by the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to receive mineral oil ( control group ; n = @ ) , olive oil ( n = @ ) , or flaxseed oil ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The initial oil dose was @mL/day , and adjustments during the follow-up could be made as needed .
METHODS	The impact of the intervention was assessed by the Rome III criteria scores .
RESULTS	The most frequent symptoms of constipation evaluated by the Roma III criteria at baseline were comparable among the groups and included `` incomplete evacuation '' ( @ % ) , `` lumpy or hard stools , '' ( @ % ) and `` anorectal obstruction '' ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The Rome III score improved significantly in patients receiving mineral oil ( @ to @ ; P < @ ) , olive oil ( @ to @ ; P = @ ) , and flaxseed oil ( @ to @ ; P < @ ) , with no significant group-by-time interaction ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The scores of @ from @ constipation symptoms reduced similarly in the mineral oil and olive oil groups , whereas only the frequency of evacuation and the consistency of stools improved in the flaxseed oil group .
CONCLUSIONS	We demonstrated that the daily use of olive oil or flaxseed oil was as effective as mineral oil in the treatment of constipation in patients undergoing hemodialysis .

BACKGROUND	The methods of evaluating endoscopic mucosal findings and the definition of mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease have not been standardized .
OBJECTIVE	To examine a third-party central review of colonic mucosal evaluations .
METHODS	A double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trial was performed for @weeks , which involved continuous administration of a @-g mesalazine suppository to @ patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and active rectal inflammatory findings .
METHODS	Mucosal findings were evaluated by using a @-grade score ( @ , @ , @ , @ ) .
METHODS	Reviews by attending physicians were considered the primary evaluations .
METHODS	Concurrently , a central review committee of @ gastroenterologists served as the third party .
RESULTS	The endoscopic remission induction rate from the attending physicians ' evaluations was @ % in the mesalazine suppository group and @ % in the placebo suppository group , whereas the respective rates from the central review committee were @ % and @ % .
RESULTS	However , there was a difference of @ percentage points between the remission induction rates of the placebo group found by the two groups of raters .
RESULTS	Differences in the evaluations of mucosal finding scores were also found among the third-party reviewers .
CONCLUSIONS	The evaluations of the attending physicians were consistent with those of the central review committee in showing the effectiveness of mesalazine suppository through the index of mucosal healing .
CONCLUSIONS	However , differences were observed among the raters in their evaluations of mucosal finding scores .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , standardizing evaluation criteria and improving review methods for mucosal findings would enable the more effective use of third-party central reviews in clinical drug trials .

OBJECTIVE	Poor and underserved women face barriers in receiving timely and appropriate breast cancer care .
OBJECTIVE	Patient navigators help individuals overcome these barriers , but little is known about whether patient navigation improves quality of care .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to examine whether navigated women with breast cancer are more likely to receive recommended standard breast cancer care .
METHODS	Women with breast cancer who participated in the national Patient Navigation Research Program were examined to determine whether the care they received included the following : initiation of antiestrogen therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer ; initiation of postlumpectomy radiation therapy ; and initiation of chemotherapy in women younger than age @ years with triple-negative tumors more than @ cm .
METHODS	This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter quasi-experimental study funded by the National Cancer Institute to evaluate patient navigation .
METHODS	Multiple logistic regression was performed to compare differences in receipt of care between navigated and non-navigated participants .
RESULTS	Among participants eligible for antiestrogen therapy , navigated participants ( n = @ ) had a statistically significant higher likelihood of receiving antiestrogen therapy compared with non-navigated controls ( n = @ ; odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ ; P = @ ) in a multivariable analysis .
RESULTS	Among the participants eligible for radiation therapy after lumpectomy , navigated participants ( n = @ ) were no more likely to receive radiation ( OR , @ ; P = @ ) than control participants ( n = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We demonstrate that navigated participants were more likely than non-navigated participants to receive antiestrogen therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies are required to determine the full impact patient navigation may have on ensuring that vulnerable populations receive quality care .

BACKGROUND	Chemoradioimmunotherapy of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the CapRI trial did not show any benefit of interferon - in addition to a @-fluorouracil ( @FU ) - based treatment .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to identify immunological parameters in patients from this trial to be used for predictive and/or prognostic purposes .
METHODS	The following methods were used : tumour immunohistology , FACS analyses , cytokine measurement , as well as cytotoxicity and ELIspot .
METHODS	Immunological parameters were correlated with patients ' survival using the Kaplan-Meier method .
RESULTS	Irrespective of therapy type , high lymphocyte accumulation in tumours and frequencies of NK cells and effector ( eff ) CD@ ( + ) T cells in peripheral blood of the patients were associated with patients ' survival .
RESULTS	Amount of CD@ ( + ) and effector-memory CD@ ( + ) blood lymphocytes , expression of CD@ and interleukin ( IL ) -@ serum level showed a predictive value for chemoradioimmunotherapy .
RESULTS	Tumoural accumulation of CD@ ( + ) and CD@ ( + ) cells was predictive for outcome of chemotherapy alone .
RESULTS	Besides , we identified the frequencies of CD@ ( + ) lymphocytes , effCD@ ( + ) T cells and NK cells in the peripheral blood of the patients , and IL-@ amount in serum , to be predictive values for @FU-based chemotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Immunological parameters , identified in this trial as possible markers , may be of interest in personalized medicine towards the improvement of the treatment and prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma patients .

BACKGROUND	Patient-specific instrumentation in TKA has the proposed benefits of improving coronal and sagittal alignment and rotation of the components .
BACKGROUND	In contrast , the literature is inconsistent if the use of patient-specific instrumentation improves alignment in comparison to conventional instrumentation .
BACKGROUND	Depending on the manufacturer , patient-specific instrumentation is based on either MRI or CT scans .
BACKGROUND	However , it is unknown whether one patient-specific instrumentation approach is more accurate than the other and if there is a potential benefit in terms of reduction of duration of surgery .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the accuracy of MRI - and CT-based patient-specific instrumentation with conventional instrumentation and with each other in TKAs .
OBJECTIVE	The three approaches also were compared with respect to validated outcomes scores and duration of surgery .
METHODS	A randomized clinical trial was conducted in which @ patients were enrolled and divided into three groups : CT-based , MRI-based patient-specific instrumentation , and conventional instrumentation .
METHODS	The groups were not different regarding age , male/female sex distribution , and BMI .
METHODS	In all groups , coronal and sagittal alignments were measured on postoperative standing long-leg and lateral radiographs .
METHODS	Component rotation was measured on CT scans .
METHODS	Clinical outcomes ( Knee Society and WOMAC scores ) were evaluated preoperatively and at a mean of @ months postoperatively and the duration of surgery was analyzed for each patient .
METHODS	MRI - and CT-based patient-specific instrumentation groups were first compared with conventional instrumentation , the patient-specific instrumentation groups were compared with each other , and all three approaches were compared for clinical outcome measures and duration of surgery .
RESULTS	Compared with conventional instrumentation MRI - and CT-based patient-specific instrumentation showed higher accuracy regarding the coronal limb axis ( MRI versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ; CT versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) , femoral rotation ( MRI versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ; CT versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ) , and tibial slope ( MRI versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ; CT versus conventional , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ) , but the differences were small .
RESULTS	Furthermore , MRI-based patient-specific instrumentation showed a smaller deviation in the postoperative coronal mechanical limb axis compared with CT-based patient-specific instrumentation ( MRI versus CT , @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- versus @ -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) , while there was no difference in femoral rotation or tibial slope .
RESULTS	Although there was a significant reduction of the duration of surgery in both patient-specific instrumentation groups in comparison to conventional instrumentation ( MRI versus conventional , @ minutes -LSB- range , @-@ minutes -RSB- versus @ minutes -LSB- range , @-@ minutes -RSB- , p < @ ; CT versus conventional , @ minutes -LSB- range , @-@ minutes -RSB- versus @ minutes -LSB- range , @-@ minutes -RSB- , p < @ ) , there were no differences in the postoperative Knee Society pain and function and WOMAC scores among the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this study supports that patient-specific instrumentation increased accuracy compared with conventional instrumentation and that MRI-based patient-specific instrumentation is more accurate compared with CT-based patient-specific instrumentation regarding coronal mechanical limb axis , differences are only subtle and of questionable clinical relevance .
CONCLUSIONS	Because there are no differences in the long-term clinical outcome or survivorship yet available , the widespread use of this technique can not be recommended .

BACKGROUND	We aimed to determine with this randomized , triple-masked , placebo-controlled study if benefits are afforded by adding a multiple-day , ambulatory , continuous ropivacaine paravertebral nerve block to a single-injection ropivacaine paravertebral block after mastectomy .
METHODS	Preoperatively , @ subjects undergoing unilateral ( n = @ ) or bilateral ( n = @ ) mastectomy received either unilateral or bilateral paravertebral perineural catheter ( s ) , respectively , inserted between the third and fourth thoracic transverse process ( es ) .
METHODS	All subjects received an initial bolus of ropivacaine @ % ( @ mL ) via the catheter ( s ) .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to receive either perineural ropivacaine @ % or normal saline using portable infusion pump ( s ) -LSB- @ mL/h basal ; @ mL reservoir ( s ) -RSB- .
METHODS	Subjects remained hospitalized for at least @ night and were subsequently discharged home where the catheter ( s ) were removed on postoperative day ( POD ) @ .
METHODS	Subjects were contacted by telephone on PODs @ , @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	The primary end point was average pain ( scale , @-@ ) queried on POD @ .
RESULTS	Average pain queried on POD @ for subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine ( n = @ ) was a median ( interquartile ) of @ ( @-@ ) , compared with @ ( @-@ ) for subjects receiving saline ( n = @ ; @ % confidence interval difference in medians , -@ to -@ ; P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	During this same period , subjects receiving ropivacaine experienced a lower severity of breakthrough pain ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; P = @ ) as well .
RESULTS	As a result , subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine experienced less pain-induced physical and emotional dysfunction , as measured with the Brief Pain Inventory ( lower score = less dysfunction ) : @ ( @-@ ) versus @ ( @-@ ) for subjects receiving perineural saline ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For the subscale that measures the degree of interference of pain on @ domains , such as general activity and relationships , subjects receiving perineural saline reported a median score @ times higher ( more dysfunction ) than those receiving ropivacaine ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , after infusion discontinuation , there were no statistically significant differences detected between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	After mastectomy , adding a multiple-day , ambulatory , continuous ropivacaine infusion to a single-injection ropivacaine paravertebral nerve block results in improved analgesia and less functional deficit during the infusion .
CONCLUSIONS	However , no benefits were identified after infusion discontinuation .

OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that short-term application of bi-level nasal continuous positive airway pressure CPAP ( SiPAP ) compared with conventional nasal CPAP ( nCPAP ) at the same mean airway pressure in infants with persistent oxygen need recovering from respiratory distress syndrome would improve CO@ removal with no change in oxygen requirement .
METHODS	Non-blinded , randomised , observational four-period crossover study .
METHODS	Level III NICU ; low-birthweight infants requiring CPAP and oxygen while recovering from respiratory distress syndrome .
METHODS	Infants requiring nasal CPAP for > @h prior to study enrolment , and fraction of inspired oxygen requirement ( FiO@ ) of @-@ @ , were randomised to either nCPAP or SiPAP .
METHODS	A crossover design with four @ h treatment periods was used such that each infant received both treatments twice .
METHODS	Oxygen saturations ( SaO@ ) , transcutaneous CO@ ( tcCO@ ) and vital signs were monitored continuously .
METHODS	Polysomnographic recordings were analysed for apnoea , bradycardia and oxygen desaturation .
RESULTS	Twenty low-birthweight infants receiving @ % supplemental oxygen on CPAP of @ cm H@O were studied at an average of @days of age ( @days , SD ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in tcCO@ or other physiological parameters except mean blood pressure , which was lower during nCPAP ( @ vs @ mmHg ; SD ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences in short or prolonged apnoea , bradycardia or significant desaturation events were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	At similar mean airway pressures , SiPAP does not improve CO@ removal , oxygenation or other studied physiological parameters with the exception of mean blood pressure , which was not clinically significant .

OBJECTIVE	Our goal was to develop and validate , based on theoretical and empirical knowledge , the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate ( PACSLAC-II ) , a shorter tool that would improve on the PACSLAC , while addressing limitations of the original version .
METHODS	The PACSLAC was revised based on the relevant clinical and theoretical literature .
METHODS	Psychometric properties and clinical utility of the resulting @-item PACSLAC-II were examined .
METHODS	Specifically , the PACSLAC-II was used to assess pain based on video footage of long-term care ( LTC ) residents with dementia undergoing painful procedures as part of routine care .
METHODS	Its ability to discriminate pain from non-pain-related states was compared with that of preexisting pain assessment tools using archival data .
METHODS	A second phase involved the use of the PACSLAC and PACSLAC-II by LTC staff to solicit feedback from health care providers .
METHODS	Mixed-methods analysis of this feedback was conducted .
RESULTS	The PACSLAC-II demonstrated satisfactory reliability , excellent validity , and ability to differentiate between pain and nonpain states .
RESULTS	The PACSLAC-II also accounted for unique variance in differentiating between pain and nonpain states , even after controlling for the preexisting tools combined , including the PACSLAC .
RESULTS	The PACSLAC-II was also preferred by many LTC nurses and care aides , because of its length and condensed nature , which was thought to facilitate documentation and greater efficiency in pain management .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings indicate that the empirical and theoretically driven revisions to the PACSLAC led to improved ability to differentiate between pain and nonpain states , while retaining its clinical utility .

OBJECTIVE	The lipid layer plays a major role in limiting evaporation of the tear film .
OBJECTIVE	Based on interference phenomena , there is a test directed to lipid layer pattern ( LLP ) evaluation , but is affected by subjective interpretation of the patterns .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to compare the LLP evaluation between two experienced observers on a group of healthy patients .
OBJECTIVE	Furthermore , observers re-evaluated the same images to check their individual repeatability .
METHODS	LLP was examined using a Tearscope-plus ( Keeler , Windsor , UK ) attached to a slit lamp .
METHODS	Tear film was recorded by a Topcon DV-@ digital camera video and LLP images were captured .
METHODS	This yielded @ LLP images that were categorized ( based on Guillon 's scheme ) by two expert observers in two sessions separated by one month .
METHODS	Interobserver repeatability and intraobserver repeatability between both sessions were studied by using Cohen 's kappa coefficient .
RESULTS	Comparing LLP categorization between both observers , Cohen 's kappa coefficient was @ and @ for first and second session , respectively .
RESULTS	When comparing LLP categorization by the same observer between both sessions , Cohen 's kappa coefficient was @ and @ for Observer @ and Observer @ , respectively .
RESULTS	These results indicate substantial correlation in all cases .
RESULTS	The most frequent misinterpretations were between open and closed meshwork and Wave and closed meshwork patterns .
CONCLUSIONS	Although substantial correlation was found between categorizations of experienced observers , misinterpretation of the patterns may appear even in the same observer .
CONCLUSIONS	Some misinterpretations between adjacent patterns could be palliated by including intermediate patterns between those categories .

OBJECTIVE	Estrogen-based hormone therapy ( HT ) attenuates abdominal fat gain after menopause , but whether HT improves abdominal fat loss during weight loss is unknown .
OBJECTIVE	It was hypothesized that HT or a selective estrogen receptor modulator ( raloxifene ) would augment reductions in abdominal visceral fat during weight loss when compared to placebo , potentially increasing improvements in glucose tolerance and lipid profile .
METHODS	Healthy postmenopausal women ( n = @ ; age @-@ yr ) underwent a @-month weight-loss ( primarily exercise ) intervention with randomization to raloxifene ( @ mg/d ) , HT ( conjugated estrogens , @ mg/d ) , or placebo .
METHODS	Outcomes were change in total and abdominal ( visceral and subcutaneous ) fat mass , lipid profile , and fasting and post-challenge glucose and insulin .
RESULTS	Neither HT nor raloxifene augmented loss of total or abdominal fat mass during exercise-induced weight loss when compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Weight loss-induced improvements in risk factors were similar among the three groups , except for a greater reduction in fasted glucose in the HT group ( difference in change -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- from placebo ; -@ -LSB- -@ , -@ -RSB- ) and greater reductions in LDL ( -@ -LSB- -@ , -@ -RSB- ) and increases in HDL ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ) in both treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Postmenopausal HT and raloxifene did not increase abdominal fat loss during weight loss , but did improve some cardiometabolic outcomes .

BACKGROUND	The use of a video-assisted laryngoscope ( VL ) has been shown to reduce the time to achieve intubation with a double-lumen endobronchial tube ( DLT ) .
BACKGROUND	As the blade of the VL is curved differently to a standard laryngoscope , the DLT must be angled into a hockey stick shape to fit properly .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a study to establish which direction of angulation was best to facilitate correct positioning of the DLT when using a VL .
METHODS	We enrolled patients scheduled for thoracic surgery who required intubation with a DLT .
METHODS	They were prospectively randomized into one of two groups : those intubated with a DLT angled to conceal the tracheal orifice ( the tracheal orifice-covered , TOC ) group or the tracheal orifice-exposed ( TOE ) group .
METHODS	The composite primary outcome measures were time taken to intubate and the frequency of first-time success .
METHODS	The time taken to intubate was divided into : T@ , the time from mouth opening to visualization of the vocal cords with the VL ; and T@ , the time taken to advance the DLT through the cords until its tip lay within the trachea and three carbon dioxide waveforms had been detected by capnography .
METHODS	The hemodynamic responses to intubation and intubation-related adverse events were also recorded .
RESULTS	Sixty-six patients completed the study , with @ in each group .
RESULTS	Total intubation time was significantly shorter in the TOC group ( mean @ standard deviation @ seconds versus @ seconds , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	T@ was also significantly shorter in the TOC group than the TOE group ( @ seconds versus @ seconds , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The severity of hoarseness on the first postoperative day and sore throat on the fourth postoperative day were significantly lower in the TOC group than the TOE group ( p = @ and < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The hemodynamic responses to intubation were broadly similar between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	When placing a left-sided DLT using a VL , angling the bronchial lumen to a hockey stick shape that conceals the tracheal lumen saves time and ameliorates the severity of post-intubation complications .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the comparison of massage therapy and routine physical therapy on patients with sub acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain .
METHODS	Thirty volunteer female subjects with a sub acute or chronic nonspecific low back pain were randomly enrolled in two groups , massage therapy and routine physical therapy .
METHODS	After massage application , the hamstring and paravertebral muscles stretching and also stabilizing exercises were prescribed .
METHODS	In the routine physical therapy group , TENS , US and vibrator were used besides exercises .
METHODS	Pain intensity according to Numerical Rating Scale , functional disability level in accordance to Oswestry Disability Index , and modified Schober test , for measurement of flexion range of motion , before and after ten sessions of treatment were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment .
RESULTS	Pain intensity , Oswestry Disability Index and flexion range of motion had shown significant differences before and after intervention in both groups ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The statistical analysis revealed that the massage therapy had significantly improved the pain intensity and Oswestry Disability Index compared to routine physical therapy ( p = @ , p = @ respectively ) , but the range of motion changes were not significant between two groups ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It can be concluded that both massage therapy and routine physical therapy are useful for sub acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain treatment especially if accompanied with exercise .
CONCLUSIONS	However , massage is more effective than other electrotherapy modalities , and it can be used alone or with electrotherapy for the treatment of patients with low back pain .

METHODS	This was a randomised , open-label , multicentre ( n = @ ) , parallel-group , non-inferiority out-patient clinical trial , with @ patients enrolled in the study .
METHODS	The study was conducted in @ centres located in four countries .
METHODS	Patients aged @ years with type @ diabetes treated with metformin ( sulfonylurea ) for at least @ months with a baseline HbA@c @-@ @ % ( @-@ @ mmol/mol ) were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) via a computer-generated randomisation sequence with a voice response system to receive albiglutide ( @ mg once a week , n = @ ) or insulin glargine ( @ U once a day , n = @ ) added to current therapy .
METHODS	Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	Doses of each medication were adjusted on the basis of the glycaemic response .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA@c at week @ .
RESULTS	In the albiglutide group , HbA@c declined from @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) ( meanSD ) at baseline to @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) at week @ .
RESULTS	A similar reduction occurred in the insulin glargine group ( @ % to @ % -LSB- @ to @ mmol/mol -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	The model-adjusted treatment difference of @ % ( @ % CI -@ % , @ % ) ( @ mmol/mol -LSB- @ % CI -@ , @ mmol/mol -RSB- ) indicated non-inferiority of albiglutide to insulin glargine based on the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of @ % ( @ mmol/mol , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Body weight increased in the insulin glargine group and decreased in the albiglutide group , with a mean treatment difference of -@ kg ( @ % CI -@ , -@ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine group than in the albiglutide group ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Albiglutide was non-inferior to insulin glargine at reducing HbA@c at week @ , with modest weight loss and less hypoglycaemia .
CONCLUSIONS	Both drugs were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Albiglutide may be considered an alternative to insulin glargine in this patient population .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate how soft lens power affects rigid gas-permeable ( RGP ) lens power and visual acuity ( VA ) in piggyback fittings for keratoconus .
METHODS	Sixteen keratoconus subjects ( @ eyes ) were included in the study .
METHODS	Piggyback contact lens fittings combining Senofilcon-A soft lenses of -@ , -@ , +@ and +@ D with Rose K@ RGP contact lenses were performed .
METHODS	Corneal topography was taken on the naked eye and over each soft contact lens before fitting RGP lenses .
METHODS	Mean central keratometry , over-refraction , RGP back optic zone radius ( BOZR ) and estimated final power as well as VA were recorded and analyzed .
RESULTS	In comparison to the naked eye , the mean central keratometry flattened with both negative lens powers ( p < @ in all cases ) , did not change with the +@ soft lens power ( p = @ ) ; and steepened with the +@ soft lens power ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Rigid gas-permeable over-refraction did not change significantly between different soft lens powers ( all p > @ ) .
RESULTS	RGP 's BOZR decreased significantly with both positive in comparison with both negative soft lens powers ( all p < @ ) , but no significant differences were found among negative - or positive-powers separately ( both p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Estimated RGP 's final power increased significantly with positive in comparison with negative lens powers ( all p < @ ) , but no significant differences were found among negative or positive lens powers separately ( both p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Visual acuity did not change significantly between the different soft lens powers assessed ( all p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of negative-powered soft lenses in piggyback fitting reduces RGP lens power without impacting VA in keratoconus subjects .

BACKGROUND	Leading medical organizations have called on primary care pediatricians to take a central role in the prevention of childhood obesity .
BACKGROUND	Weight counseling typically has not been incorporated into routine pediatric practice due to time and training constraints .
BACKGROUND	Brief interventions with simple behavior change messages are needed to reach high-risk children , particularly Latino and Black children who are disproportionately affected by obesity and related comorbidities .
BACKGROUND	Steps to Growing Up Healthy ( Added Value ) is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of brief motivational counseling ( BMC ) delivered by primary care clinicians and the added value of supplementing BMC with monthly contact by community health workers ( CHW ) in the prevention/reversal of obesity in Latino and Black children ages @-@years old .
METHODS	Mother-child dyads ( targeted n = @ ) are recruited for this @-month randomized trial at an inner-city pediatric primary care clinic and randomized to : @ ) BMC delivered by clinicians and nurses at well , sick , and WIC visits with the goal of reducing obesogenic behaviors ( BMC ) ; @ ) BMC plus monthly phone calls by a CHW ( BMC+P hone ) ; or @ ) BMC plus monthly home visits by a CHW ( BMC+H ome ) .
METHODS	During BMC , the medical team facilitates the selection of a specific goal ( i.e. , reduce sugar sweetened beverage consumption ) that is meaningful to the mother and teaches the mother simple behavioral strategies .
METHODS	Monthly contacts with CHWs are designed to identify and overcome barriers to goal progress .
METHODS	Dyads are assessed at baseline and @months and the primary outcome is change in the child 's BMI percentile .
METHODS	We hypothesize that BMC+P hone and BMC+H ome will produce greater reductions in BMI percentiles than BMC alone and that BMC+H ome will produce greater reductions in BMI percentiles than BMC+P hone .
CONCLUSIONS	Steps to Growing Up Healthy will provide important information about whether a brief primary care-based intervention that utilizes a motivational interviewing and goal setting approach can be incorporated into routine care and is sufficient to prevent/reverse obesity in young children .
CONCLUSIONS	The study will also explore whether monthly contact with a community health worker bridges the gap between the clinic and the community and is an effective strategy for promoting obesity prevention in high-risk families .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the associations between treatment/outcome expectations , alliance before and during treatment , and the impact of alliance on symptomatic improvement .
METHODS	One hundred and fifty-three depressed patients randomized to dynamic supportive-expressive psychotherapy ( SET ) , antidepressant medication ( ADM ) or placebo ( PBO ) + clinical management completed ratings of treatment expectations , therapeutic alliance ( CALPAS , WAI-S ) , and depressive symptoms ( HAM-D ) .
RESULTS	Pretreatment expectations of the therapeutic alliance were significantly related to alliance later in therapy but did not differ across treatments and did not predict outcome .
RESULTS	Alliance development over time differed between treatments ; it increased more in SET than in PBO .
RESULTS	After controlling for prior symptom improvement , early alliance predicted subsequent depression change .
CONCLUSIONS	Expectations of alliance and of treatment outcome/improvement , measured prior to treatment onset , predicted subsequent alliance .

BACKGROUND	Successful implementation is a vital precondition for investigating the outcome of care innovation .
BACKGROUND	This study concerned the evaluation of the implementation of integrated emotion-oriented care ( IEOC ) in psychogeriatric nursing home wards .
BACKGROUND	The main question was whether the trained caregivers actually applied the knowledge and techniques of IEOC during their daily work .
METHODS	The study was conducted within the framework of a randomized clinical trial into the effectiveness of IEOC in @ wards .
METHODS	Preceding the experimental period , staff from @ wards were educated and trained to work with a standardized care plan , resulting in a similar level of quality of care at the start of the trial .
METHODS	On the experimental wards IEOC was then implemented by training on the job in addition to training courses for personnel .
METHODS	To examine the implementation effectiveness , a self-report questionnaire , 'Em otion-oriented Skills in the Interaction with Elderly People with Dementia ' , was administered at baseline and after @ months to a sample of caregivers from the experimental and the control wards .
METHODS	In addition , participant observation was conducted on four experimental and four control wards , and time spent by care personnel on different type of care tasks was registered .
RESULTS	The implementation of IEOC resulted in increased emotion-oriented skills and more knowledge of the residents among the caregivers .
RESULTS	Providing IEOC was not more time consuming for the caregivers than providing usual care .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that the implementation of IEOC was effective .
CONCLUSIONS	It is recommended that in intervention studies the correct application of a new intervention or care approach is examined before jumping to conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention or care approach itself .

BACKGROUND	Randomized trials of complex , non-pharmacologic interventions implemented in home and community settings , such as the University of Southern California ( USC ) - Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center ( RLANRC ) Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study ( PUPS ) , present unique challenges with respect to ( @ ) participant recruitment and retention , ( @ ) intervention delivery and fidelity , ( @ ) randomization and assessment , and ( @ ) potential inadvertent treatment effects .
OBJECTIVE	We describe the methods employed to address the challenges confronted in implementing PUPS .
OBJECTIVE	In this randomized controlled trial , we are assessing the efficacy of a complex , preventive intervention in reducing the incidence of , and costs associated with , the development of medically serious pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury .
METHODS	Individuals with spinal cord injury recruited from RLANRC were assigned to either a @-month preventive intervention group or a standard care control group .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the incidence of serious pressure ulcers with secondary endpoints including ulcer-related surgeries , medical treatment costs , and quality of life .
METHODS	These outcomes are assessed at @ and @ months after randomization .
METHODS	Additionally , we are studying the mediating mechanisms that account for intervention outcomes .
RESULTS	PUPS has been successfully implemented , including recruitment of the target sample size of @ participants , assurance of the integrity of intervention protocol delivery with an average @ % treatment adherence rate , and enactment of the assessment plan .
RESULTS	However , implementation has been replete with challenges .
RESULTS	To meet recruitment goals , we instituted a five-pronged approach customized for an underserved , ethnically diverse population .
RESULTS	In intervention delivery , we increased staff time to overcome economic and cultural barriers to retention and adherence .
RESULTS	To ensure treatment fidelity and replicability , we monitored intervention protocol delivery in accordance with a rigorous plan .
RESULTS	Finally , we have overcome unanticipated assessment and design concerns related to ( @ ) determining pressure ulcer incidence/severity , ( @ ) randomization imbalance , and ( @ ) inadvertent potential control group contamination .
CONCLUSIONS	We have addressed the most daunting challenges encountered in the recruitment , assessment , and intervention phases of PUPS .
CONCLUSIONS	Some challenges and solutions may not apply to trials conducted in other settings .
CONCLUSIONS	Overcoming challenges has required a multifaceted approach incorporating individualization , flexibility , and persistence , as well as the ability to implement needed mid-course corrections .

OBJECTIVE	Different drug combinations are used for sedation in colonoscopy procedures .
OBJECTIVE	A ketamine-propofol ( ketofol ) mixture provides effective sedation and has minimal adverse effects .
OBJECTIVE	Alfentanil also provides anesthesia for short surgical procedures by incremental injection as an adjunct .
OBJECTIVE	However , no study has investigated the use of ketofol compared with an opioid-propofol combination in colonoscopic procedures .
METHODS	A total of @ patients , ASA physical status I-II , scheduled to undergo elective colonoscopy , were enrolled in this prospective randomized study and allocated to two groups .
METHODS	After premedication , sedation induction was performed with @ mg/kg ketamine +@ mg/kg propofol in Group KP , and @ mg/kg alfentanil +@ mg/kg propofol in Group AP .
METHODS	Propofol was added when required .
METHODS	Demographic data , colonoscopy duration , recovery time , discharge time , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , peripheral oxygen saturation , Ramsey Sedation Scale values , colonoscopy patients ' satisfaction scores , and complications were recorded .
RESULTS	The need for additional propofol doses was significantly higher in Group AP than in Group KP .
RESULTS	MAP at minute @ and @ , Ramsey Sedation Scale at minute @ , and discharge time were significantly higher in Group KP than in Group AP .
RESULTS	Additional propofol doses and total propofol dose were significantly lower in Group KP than in Group AP .
CONCLUSIONS	Ketofol provided better hemodynamic stability and quality of sedation compared with alfentanil-propofol combination in elective colonoscopy , and required fewer additional propofol ; however , it prolonged discharge time .
CONCLUSIONS	Both combinations can safely be used in colonoscopy sedation .

OBJECTIVE	Impulse control disorders ( ICDs ) in Parkinson disease ( PD ) are common and can be difficult to manage .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naltrexone , an opioid antagonist , for the treatment of ICDs in PD .
METHODS	Patients with PD ( n = @ ) and an ICD were enrolled in an @-week , randomized ( @:@ ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of naltrexone @-@ mg/d ( flexible dosing ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was response based on the Clinical Global Impression-Change score , and the secondary outcome measure was change in symptom severity using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson 's Disease-Rating Scale ( QUIP-RS ) ICD score .
RESULTS	Forty-five patients ( @ % ) completed the study .
RESULTS	The Clinical Global Impression-Change response rate difference favoring naltrexone in completers was @ % ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	While this difference was not significant ( odds ratio = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , Wald @ -LSB- df -RSB- = @ -LSB- @ -RSB- , p = @ ) , naltrexone treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in QUIP-RS ICD score over time compared with placebo ( regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model = -@ , F -LSB- df -RSB- = @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The estimated changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to week @ were @ points ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) for naltrexone and @ points ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) for placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Naltrexone treatment was not efficacious for the treatment of ICDs in PD using a global assessment of response , but findings using a PD-specific ICD rating scale support further evaluation of opioid antagonists for the treatment of ICD symptoms in PD .
METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with PD and an ICD , naltrexone does not significantly increase the probability of achieving response .
METHODS	However , the study lacked the precision to exclude an important difference in response rates .

OBJECTIVE	One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) .
OBJECTIVE	CALGB @ ( Alliance ) , a @ @ factorial , open-label , randomized phase II trial , evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab .
METHODS	Patients ( N = @ ) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel @ mg/m ( @ ) once per week ( wP ) for @ weeks , followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every @ weeks ( ddAC ) for four cycles , and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin ( area under curve @ ) once every @ weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab @ mg/kg once every @ weeks for nine cycles .
METHODS	Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast ( ypT@/is ) , pCR breast/axilla ( ypT@/isN@ ) , treatment delivery , and toxicities were analyzed .
RESULTS	Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses , dose modification , or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity .
RESULTS	Grade @ neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin , as were hypertension , infection , thromboembolic events , bleeding , and postoperative complications with bevacizumab .
RESULTS	Employing one-sided P values , addition of either carboplatin ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) or bevacizumab ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) significantly increased pCR breast , whereas only carboplatin ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla .
RESULTS	More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated .
CONCLUSIONS	In stage II to III TNBC , addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates , but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown .
CONCLUSIONS	Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials , further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely , but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies , ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent .

OBJECTIVE	Impaired regulation of lipid oxidation ( metabolic inflexibility ) is associated with obesity and type @ diabetes mellitus .
OBJECTIVE	Recent evidence has indicated that dietary polyphenols may modulate mitochondrial function , substrate metabolism and energy expenditure in humans .
OBJECTIVE	The present study investigated the effects of short-term supplementation of two combinations of polyphenols on energy expenditure ( EE ) and substrate metabolism in overweight subjects .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy overweight volunteers ( @ women , @ men ; age @ years ; body mass index @ kgm ( -@ ) ) participated in a randomized , double-blind cross-over trial .
METHODS	Combinations of epigallocatechin-gallate ( E , @mgday ( -@ ) ) + resveratrol ( R , @mgday ( -@ ) ) and E+R +@ mgday ( -@ ) soy isoflavones ( S ) or placebo capsules ( PLA ) were supplemented twice daily for a period of @ days .
METHODS	On day @ , circulating metabolite concentrations , EE and substrate oxidation ( using indirect calorimetry ) were measured during fasting and postprandial conditions for @h ( high-fat-mixed meal ( @ MJ , @ E % fat ) ) .
RESULTS	Short-term supplementation of E+R increased resting EE ( E+R vs PLA : @ vs @ kJmin ( -@ ) , P = @ ) , whereas both E+R ( @kJ@min ( -@ ) vs @kJ@min ( -@ ) , P = @ ) and E+R+S ( @kJ@min ( -@ ) vs @kJ@min ( -@ ) , P = @ ) increased @-@h-postprandial EE compared with PLA .
RESULTS	Metabolic flexibility , calculated as the postprandial increase to the highest respiratory quotient achieved , tended to be improved by E+R compared with PLA and E+R+S only in men ( E+R vs PLA : @ vs @ , P = @ ; E+R+S : @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	E+R+S significantly increased fasting plasma free fatty acid ( P = @ ) and glycerol ( P = @ ) concentrations compared with PLA .
CONCLUSIONS	We demonstrated for the first time that combined E+R supplementation for @ days significantly increased fasting and postprandial EE , which was accompanied by improved metabolic flexibility in men but not in women .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of soy isoflavones partially reversed these effects possibly due to their higher lipolytic potential .
CONCLUSIONS	The present findings may imply that long-term supplementation of these dosages of epigallocatechin-gallate combined with resveratrol may improve metabolic health and body weight regulation .

OBJECTIVE	Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) is a disease typically requiring in-hospital treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We conducted a trial to assess the feasibility of early discharge from the hospital for patients with mild non-alcoholic acute pancreatitis ( NAAP ) .
METHODS	Eighty-four patients with mild NAAP were randomized to home or hospital groups after a short hospital stay ( @h ) .
METHODS	AP was defined by the revised Atlanta criteria .
METHODS	Mild AP was defined as an Imrie score@ and a harmless acute pancreatitis score ( HAPS ) @ in the first @-h of presentation .
METHODS	A nurse visited all patients in the home group on the @nd , @rd and @th days .
METHODS	All patients presented for follow-up in clinic on the @th , @th , and @th days .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the time to resolution of pain .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes evaluated included time to resumption of an oral diet , @ day hospital readmission rate as well as the total costs associated with either approach to care .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the groups with regards to demographics , prognostic severity scores , symptoms , and biliary findings .
RESULTS	No patients developed organ failure , pancreatic necrosis , or died in either group .
RESULTS	Time to the resolution of pain and resumption of solid food intake were similar .
RESULTS	Three ( @ % ) patients required readmission within @ days , @ from home and @ from the hospital groups .
RESULTS	The total cost was significantly less in home group ( $ @ vs. $ @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mild NAAP can be safely treated at home with regular visits by a nurse under the supervision of a physician .
CONCLUSIONS	Widespread adoption of this practice may result in large cost savings .

OBJECTIVE	Clopidogrel plays a central role in the treatment of patients undergoing carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to evaluate the effect of clopidogrel ( @ mg/d ) on platelet reactivity in responders and nonresponders and the antiplatelet effect of different doses of clopidogrel in patients with high on-treatment reactivity ( OTR ) after CAS .
METHODS	Patients with high OTR ( defined by VerifyNow ( Accumetrics , San Diego , Calif ) assay as @ P@Y@ reaction units -LSB- PRU -RSB- ) were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to group @ ( standard-dose clopidogrel therapy : @ mg/d for @ days ) or group @ ( high-dose clopidogrel : @ mg/d for @ days ) .
RESULTS	The study enrolled @ patients .
RESULTS	Of these , @ ( @ % ) were clopidogrel responders ( group @ ) , and @ ( @ % ) had high OTR ( clopidogrel nonresponders ) ; of which , @ were randomly assigned to group @ and @ to group @ .
RESULTS	At baseline , the PRU value did not differ between group @ ( @ @ ) and group @ ( @ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients displayed reduced mean platelet reactivity levels at @ days in group @ ( @ @ ; P < @ ) and group @ ( @ @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Although high-dose clopidogrel resulted in more intense platelet function inhibition , the differences between median @-day PRU values ( P = @ ) and the percentage change of PRU ( P = @ ) for groups @ and @ were not significant .

BACKGROUND	Both exposure to hypoxia and exercise training have the potential to modulate appetite and induce beneficial metabolic adaptations .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine whether daily moderate exercise training performed during a @-day exposure to normobaric hypoxia alters hormonal appetite regulation and augments metabolic health .
METHODS	Fourteen healthy , male participants underwent a @-day hypoxic confinement at @ m simulated altitude ( FIO@ = @ @ % ) either combined with daily moderate intensity exercise ( Exercise group ; N = @ , Age = @ @ yrs , BMI = @ @ kg m ( -@ ) ) or without any exercise ( Sedentary group ; N = @ Age = @ @ yrs , BMI = @ @ kg m ( -@ ) ) .
METHODS	A meal tolerance test was performed before ( Pre ) and after the confinement ( Post ) to quantify fasting and postp randial concentrations of selected appetite-related hormones and metabolic risk markers .
METHODS	@C-Glucose was dissolved in the test meal and @CO@ determined in breath samples .
METHODS	Perceived appetite ratings were obtained throughout the meal tolerance tests .
RESULTS	While body mass decreased in both groups ( -@ kg ; p = @ ) following the confinement , whole body fat mass was only reduced in the Exercise group ( -@ kg ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At Post , postprandial serum insulin was reduced in the Sedentary group ( -@ % ; p = @ ) and postprandial plasma glucose in the Exercise group ( -@ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fasting serum total cholesterol levels were reduced ( -@ % ; p = @ ) at Post in the Exercise group only , secondary to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction ( -@ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences between groups or testing periods were noted in fasting and/or postprandial concentrations of total ghrelin , peptide YY , and glucagon-like peptide-@ , leptin , adiponectin , expired @CO@ as well as perceived appetite ratings ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that performing daily moderate intensity exercise training during continuous hypoxic exposure does not alter hormonal appetite regulation but can improve the lipid profile in healthy young males .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to determine whether specific biochemical and energy concentrations influence gastric emptying of unfortified and fortified mother 's own milk ( MOM ) in stable preterm infants , and whether gastric emptying differs between feeds of unfortified MOM and feeds fortified with S-@ or FM @ human milk fortifier ( HMF ) when infants are fed the same volume under similar conditions .
OBJECTIVE	Influences of infant gestation , age , and weight , and feed characteristics were also explored .
METHODS	Stomach volumes of @ paired unfortified and fortified MOM feeds were monitored prefeed and postfeed delivery and at @-minute intervals thereafter .
METHODS	For each feed , MOM samples were analyzed to determine concentrations of total protein , casein , whey , carbohydrate , lactose , fat , and energy .
METHODS	Fortified feed compositions were calculated by adding fortifier biochemical and energy concentrations to unfortified MOM concentrations .
METHODS	Ultrasound images were used to calculate infant stomach volumes .
METHODS	Statistical comparisons were made of paired stomach volume measurements .
RESULTS	Higher feed concentrations of casein were associated with faster gastric emptying during feed delivery ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	When compared with unfortified MOM , S-@ fortified feeds emptied similarly , whereas FM @ fortified feeds emptied more slowly both during feed delivery and during the postprandial period ( P = @ , < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Gastric emptying was slower for @-hourly feeds compared with that for @-hourly feeds ( P = @ ) and in supine position compared with that in prone ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Breast milk composition influences gastric emptying in stable preterm infants , with feeds of higher casein concentration emptying faster during feeding than otherwise equivalent feeds , and FM @ fortified MOM emptying more slowly than unfortified MOM .

BACKGROUND	Given the substantial improvements in cancer screening and cancer treatment in the United States , millions of adult cancer survivors live for years following their initial cancer diagnosis and treatment .
BACKGROUND	However , latent side effects can occur and some symptoms can be alleviated or managed effectively via changes in lifestyle behaviors .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a six-week Web-based multiple health behavior change program for adult survivors .
METHODS	Participants ( n = @ ) were recruited from oncology clinics , a tumor registry , as well as through online mechanisms , such as Facebook and the Association of Cancer Online Resources ( ACOR ) .
METHODS	Cancer survivors were eligible if they had completed their primary cancer treatment from @ weeks to @ years before enrollment .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to the Web-based program or a delayed-treatment control condition .
RESULTS	In total , @ survivors completed the follow-up survey ( six months after completion of the baseline survey ) and participants in the Web-based intervention condition had significantly greater reductions in insomnia and greater increases in minutes per week of vigorous exercise and stretching compared to controls .
RESULTS	There were no significant changes in fruit and vegetable consumption or other outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The Web-based intervention impacted insomnia and exercise ; however , a majority of the sample met or exceeded national recommendations for health behaviors and were not suffering from depression or fatigue at baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , the survivors were very healthy and well-adjusted upon entry and their ability to make substantial health behavior changes may have been limited .
CONCLUSIONS	Future work is discussed , with emphasis placed on ways in which Web-based interventions can be more specifically analyzed for benefit , such as in regard to social networking .

OBJECTIVE	The GUIDE-IT ( Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure ) study is designed to determine the safety , efficacy , and cost-effectiveness of a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) level of < @,@ pg/ml compared with usual care in high-risk patients with systolic heart failure ( HF ) .
BACKGROUND	Elevations in natriuretic peptide ( NP ) levels provide key prognostic information in patients with HF .
BACKGROUND	Therapies proven to improve outcomes in patients with HF are generally associated with decreasing levels of NPs , and observational data show that decreases in NP levels over time are associated with favorable outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Results from smaller prospective , randomized studies of this strategy thus far have been mixed , and current guidelines do not recommend serial measurement of NP levels to guide therapy in patients with HF .
METHODS	GUIDE-IT is a prospective , randomized , controlled , unblinded , multicenter clinical trial designed to randomize approximately @,@ high-risk subjects with systolic HF ( left ventricular ejection fraction@ % ) to either usual care ( optimized guideline-recommended therapy ) or a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target NT-proBNP level of < @,@ pg/ml .
METHODS	Patients in either arm of the study are followed up at regular intervals and after treatment adjustments for a minimum of @ months .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of the study is time to cardiovascular death or first hospitalization for HF .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality , cumulative mortality , health-related quality of life , resource use , cost-effectiveness , and safety .
CONCLUSIONS	The GUIDE-IT study is designed to definitively assess the effects of an NP-guided strategy in high-risk patients with systolic HF on clinically relevant endpoints of mortality , hospitalization , quality of life , and medical resourceuse .

OBJECTIVE	The effects of short-term high-intensity interval training ( HIT ) on cardiac autonomic function are unclear .
OBJECTIVE	The present study assessed cardiac autonomic adaptations to short-term HIT in comparison with aerobic endurance training ( AET ) .
METHODS	Twenty-six healthy middle-age sedentary men were randomized into HIT ( n = @ , @-@ @ s of all-out cycling efforts with @-min recovery ) and AET ( n = @ , @-@ min at @ % of peak workload ) groups , performing six sessions within @ wk .
METHODS	The participants underwent a @-h ECG recording before and after the intervention and , additionally , recorded R-R interval data in supine position ( @ min ) at home every morning during the intervention .
METHODS	Mean HR and low-frequency ( LF ) and high-frequency ( HF ) power of R-R interval oscillation were analyzed from these recordings .
RESULTS	Peak oxygen consumption ( VO@peak ) increased in both groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with AET ( n = @ ) , HIT ( n = @ ) increased @-h LF power ( P = @ ) , tended to increase @-h HF power ( P = @ ) , and increased daytime HF power ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In home-based measurements , supine HF power decreased on the days after HIT ( P = @ , n = @ ) but not AET ( P = @ , n = @ ) session .
RESULTS	The acute response of HF power to HIT session did not change during the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , HIT was more effective short-term strategy to increase R-R interval variability than aerobic training , most probably by inducing larger increases in cardiac vagal activity .
CONCLUSIONS	The acute autonomic responses to the single HIT session were not modified by short-term training .

METHODS	In @ of the trials , participants were provided with water equivalent to either @ or @ percent body mass loss and also received salt capsules ( NaCl , @ mmol/L ) .
METHODS	A set volume of alcohol or placebo was then consumed in each trial , incorporating the conditions : dehydration-placebo ( DP ) , dehydration-alcohol ( DA ) , partial rehydration-alcohol ( PA ) , and full rehydration-alcohol ( FA ) .
METHODS	The volume of the alcoholic beverage was individually calculated and intended to raise the blood alcohol content ( BAC ) to @ percent .
METHODS	The same driving task was then readministered ( drive @ ) .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures of driving consisted of standard deviation of lateral position ( SDLP ) , number of side and center line crossings ( LC ) , number of failures to stop at red traffic signals ( FTS ) , number of impacts/collisions with other vehicles or objects ( IMP ) , and time to collision with a specified lead vehicle ( TTC ) .
METHODS	In addition , reaction time ( RT ) and incorrect inhibition response ( IIR ) behavior to critical events were collected throughout each experimental drive .
METHODS	Subjective ratings of mood and estimates of alcohol intoxication and driving impairment were also recorded in each trial .
RESULTS	No effects of trial condition were observed on any of the driving performance measures or on subjective ratings of mood , alcohol intoxication , and driving impairment .
RESULTS	SDLP was higher following the consumption of alcohol compared to the placebo trial .
RESULTS	However , no differences in SDLP were recorded between the alcohol trials , indicating that hydration level had no observable interaction with alcohol to influence SDLP performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , it appears that dehydration does not exacerbate impairment in driving performance caused by mild-moderate alcohol intoxication .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is required to clarify the effects of alcohol and dehydration at various alcohol doses .

BACKGROUND	Carboplatin plus paclitaxel administered every @ weeks is standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer .
BACKGROUND	A weekly paclitaxel schedule combined with carboplatin every @ weeks prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in a Japanese phase @ trial .
BACKGROUND	The aim of our study was to assess whether a weekly schedule of carboplatin plus paclitaxel is more effective than the same drugs given every @ weeks .
METHODS	We did a multicentre , randomised , phase @ study at @ institutions in Italy and France .
METHODS	Women with FIGO stage IC-IV ovarian cancer , an ECOG performance status of @ or lower , and who had never received chemotherapy were randomly allocated in a @:@ ratio to receive either carboplatin ( AUC @ mg/mL per min ) plus paclitaxel ( @ mg/m ( @ ) ) every @ weeks for six cycles or carboplatin ( AUC @ mg/mL per min ) plus paclitaxel ( @ mg/m ( @ ) ) every week for @ weeks .
METHODS	Randomisation was done by computer-based minimisation , stratified by centre , residual disease after surgery , and ECOG performance status .
METHODS	The study was not blinded .
METHODS	Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival and quality of life ( assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Ovarian Trial Outcome Index -LSB- FACT-O/TOI -RSB- score ) , and analysis was by modified intention to treat .
METHODS	This report presents the final analysis .
METHODS	The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ patients were enrolled into the study between Nov @ , @ , and March @ , @ ; @ withdrew their consent immediately after randomisation and were excluded , and @ were eligible for analysis .
RESULTS	@ women were allocated treatment every @ weeks and @ were assigned to the weekly schedule .
RESULTS	After median follow-up of @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , @ progression-free survival events were recorded .
RESULTS	Median progression-free survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) in patients assigned to treatment every @ weeks , versus @ months ( @-@ ) in women allocated to the weekly schedule ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	FACT-O/TOI scores differed significantly between the two schedules ( treatment-by-time interaction p < @ ) ; with treatment every @ weeks , FACT-O/TOI scores worsened at every cycle ( weeks @ , @ , and @ ) , whereas for the weekly schedule , after transient worsening at week @ , FACT-O/TOI scores remained stable .
RESULTS	Fewer patients assigned to the weekly group than those allocated treatment every @ weeks had grade @-@ neutropenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ) , febrile neutropenia ( two -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , grade @-@ thrombocytopenia ( four -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and grade @ or worse neuropathy ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Three deaths during the study were attributed to chemotherapy ; two women died who were allocated treatment every @ weeks and one death was recorded in the group assigned the weekly regimen .
CONCLUSIONS	A weekly regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel might be a reasonable option for first-line treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer .

OBJECTIVE	Cognitive impairments contribute significantly to inadequate functional recovery following illness episodes in bipolar disorder , yet data on treatment interventions are sparse .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed the cognitive effects of a standardized extract of the medicinal herb Withania somnifera ( WSE ) in bipolar disorder .
METHODS	Sixty euthymic subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were enrolled in an @-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized study of WSE ( @ mg/d ) as a procognitive agent added adjunctively to the medications being used as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder .
METHODS	Study enrollment and data analyses were completed between December @ and September @ .
METHODS	Cognitive testing at baseline and @ weeks assessed primary efficacy outcomes .
METHODS	Psychopathology and adverse events were monitored at scheduled visits .
RESULTS	Fifty-three patients completed the study ( WSE , n = @ ; placebo , n = @ ) , and the @ groups were matched in terms of demographic , illness , and treatment characteristics .
RESULTS	Compared to placebo , WSE provided significant benefits for @ cognitive tasks : digit span backward ( P = @ ) , Flanker neutral response time ( P = @ ) , and the social cognition response rating of the Penn Emotional Acuity Test ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The size of the WSE treatment effect for digit span backward was in the medium range ( Cohen d = @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	None of the other cognitive tasks showed significant between-group differences .
RESULTS	Mood and anxiety scale scores remained stable , and adverse events were minor .
CONCLUSIONS	Although results are preliminary , WSE appears to improve auditory-verbal working memory ( digit span backward ) , a measure of reaction time , and a measure of social cognition in bipolar disorder .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the paucity of data for improving cognitive capacity in bipolar disorder , WSE offers promise , appears to have a benign side-effects profile , and merits further study .

OBJECTIVE	The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network recently reported no difference in the primary end point of left ventricular end-systolic volume index at @ year postsurgery in patients randomized to repair ( n = @ ) or replacement ( n = @ ) for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation .
OBJECTIVE	However , patients undergoing repair experienced significantly more recurrent mitral regurgitation than patients undergoing replacement ( @ % vs @ % ) .
OBJECTIVE	We examined whether baseline echocardiographic and clinical characteristics could identify those who will develop moderate/severe recurrent mitral regurgitation or die .
METHODS	Our analysis includes @ patients who were randomized to and received mitral valve repair .
METHODS	Logistic regression was used to estimate a model-based probability of recurrence or death from baseline factors .
METHODS	Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed from these estimated probabilities to determine classification cut-points maximizing accuracy of prediction based on sensitivity and specificity .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients , @ received a replacement before leaving the operating room ; all other patients had mild or less mitral regurgitation on intraoperative echocardiogram after repair .
RESULTS	During the @-year follow-up period , @ patients developed moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or died ( @ mitral regurgitation recurrences , @ mitral regurgitation recurrences and death , and @ deaths ) .
RESULTS	The mechanism for recurrent mitral regurgitation was largely mitral valve leaflet tethering .
RESULTS	Our model ( including age , body mass index , sex , race , effective regurgitant orifice area , basal aneurysm/dyskinesis , New York Heart Association class , history of coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary intervention , or ventricular arrhythmias ) yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The model demonstrated good discrimination in identifying patients who will survive @ years without recurrent mitral regurgitation after mitral valve repair .
CONCLUSIONS	Although our results require validation , they offer a clinically relevant risk score for selection of surgical candidates for this procedure .

BACKGROUND	Diabetes may confer an increased risk for the cardiovascular health effects of particulate air pollution , but few human clinical studies of air pollution have included people with diabetes .
BACKGROUND	Ultrafine particles ( UFP , @ nm in diameter ) have been hypothesized to be an important component of particulate air pollution with regard to cardiovascular health effects .
METHODS	@ never-smoker subjects @-@ years of age , with stable type @ diabetes but otherwise healthy , inhaled either filtered air ( @-@ particles/cm@ ) or elemental carbon UFP ( ~ @ particles/cm@ , ~ @ ug/m@ , count median diameter @ nm ) by mouthpiece , for @ hours at rest , in a double-blind , randomized , crossover study design .
METHODS	A digital @-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) was recorded continuously for @ hours , beginning @ hour prior to exposure .
RESULTS	Analysis of @-minute segments of the ECG during quiet rest showed reduced high-frequency heart rate variability with UFP relative to air exposure ( p = @ ) , paralleled by non-significant reductions in time-domain heart rate variability parameters .
RESULTS	In the analysis of longer durations of the ECG , we found that UFP exposure increased the heart rate relative to air exposure .
RESULTS	During the @ - to @-hour interval after exposure , the average heart rate increased approximately @ beats per minute with UFP , compared to @ beats per minute with air ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no UFP effects on cardiac rhythm or repolarization .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhalation of elemental carbon ultrafine particles alters heart rate and heart rate variability in people with type @ diabetes .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that effects may occur and persist hours after a single @-hour exposure .

OBJECTIVE	Myoclonic movements are common problems during induction of anaesthesia with etomidate .
OBJECTIVE	The myoclonus occurring after etomidate administration may represent a form of seizure .
OBJECTIVE	Agonistic modulation of the opiate receptor may reduce seizures , and butorphanol acts in such a manner .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was to test our hypothesis that pre-treatment with butorphanol might reduce the incidence and severity of myoclonus induced by etomidate .
METHODS	Patients ( @ ) with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I or II were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either @ mg/kg of butorphanol ( n = @ ) or saline ( n = @ ) intravenously .
METHODS	At two minutes after infusion of butorphanol or saline , @ mg/kg etomidate was given .
METHODS	The occurrence and severity ( observational score of @-@ ) of myoclonus was assessed during @ minutes after administration of etomidate .
METHODS	For each patient , blood pressure ( BP ) , saturation of peripheral oxygen ( SpO ) , and heart rate ( HR ) were measured .
RESULTS	The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in Group Butorphanol than in Group Saline ( @ % vs @ % ; RR = @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ ; = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The severity levels of myoclonic movement were also significantly lower in Group Butorphanol than in Group Saline ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Throughout the procedure , changes of BP , SpO , and HR did not differ between the groups .

BACKGROUND	Depressive symptoms occur frequently in Dutch society .
BACKGROUND	Recently a new method for treating depressive symptoms was introduced in the Netherlands .
BACKGROUND	The method , known as ` multi-moment non-invasive neurostimulation ' ( MNNS ) , involves presenting patients with a series of photographs , each picture having a positive valence .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this method is to improve the mood of patients .
BACKGROUND	So far , however , the method has not been thoroughly tested .
OBJECTIVE	To conduct a pilot study designed to compare the effectiveness of MNNS pictures with pictures from the International Affective Pictures System ( IAPS ) by means of a double-blind randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Thirty-three patients with depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to two groups , one representing the experimental condition ( MNNS ) and the other the control condition ( IAPS ) .
METHODS	Patients were treated for six weeks in one mood-inductive session per week .
METHODS	The severity of the patients ' depressive symptoms was assessed before the mood-induction treatment began and again at one week and at three months after the final session .
RESULTS	Each group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the MNNS condition and the control condition with regard to the reduction of depressive symptoms over time .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a marked reduction in the depressive symptoms of the patients of both groups which had received short-term treatments involving the viewing of pictures with a positive valence .
CONCLUSIONS	This reduction was still apparent three months after the treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The positive pictures presented in the MNNS method were found to be just as effective in reducing depressive symptoms as the positive pictures presented by the IAPS .

BACKGROUND	Randomized studies examining the effect of training of mental health professionals in suicide prevention guidelines are scarce .
BACKGROUND	We assessed whether professionals benefited from an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme aimed at the application of the Dutch multidisciplinary suicide prevention guideline .
METHODS	@ psychiatric departments from all over the Netherlands were clustered in pairs and randomized .
METHODS	In the experimental condition , all of the staff of psychiatric departments was trained by peers with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme .
METHODS	Guideline adherence of individual professionals was measured by means of the response to on-line video fragments .
METHODS	Multilevel analyses were used to establish whether variation between conditions was due to differences between individual professionals or departments .
RESULTS	Multilevel analysis showed that the intervention resulted in an improvement of individual professionals .
RESULTS	At the @ month follow-up , professionals who received the intervention showed greater guideline adherence , improved self-perceived knowledge and improved confidence as providers of care than professionals who were only exposed to traditional guideline dissemination .
RESULTS	Subgroup analyses showed that improved guideline adherence was found among nurses but not among psychiatrists and psychologists .
RESULTS	No significant effect of the intervention on team performance was found .
CONCLUSIONS	The ICT environment in departments was often technically inadequate when displaying the video clips clip of the survey .
CONCLUSIONS	This may have caused considerable drop-out and possibly introduced selection bias , as professionals who were strongly affiliated to the theme of the study might have been more likely to finish the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results support the idea that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme is an effective strategy for implementing clinical guidelines and improving care for suicidal patients .

METHODS	People who require an interpreter or hands-on assistance to walk ; live in residential aged care or > @km from the trial hospital ; have terminal illness , cognitive impairment , documented aggressive behaviour or a history of psychosis ; are receiving palliative care or are unable to use a telephone will be excluded .
METHODS	Participants will be randomly allocated to the RESPOND intervention or standard care control group .
METHODS	RESPOND incorporates ( @ ) a home-based risk factor assessment ; ( @ ) education , coaching , goal setting and follow-up telephone support for management of one or more of four risk factors with evidence of effective interventions and ( @ ) healthcare provider communication and community linkage delivered over @months .
METHODS	Primary outcomes are falls and fall injuries per person-year .
CONCLUSIONS	RESPOND builds on prior falls prevention learnings and aims to help individuals make guided decisions about how they will manage their falls risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Patient-centred models have been successfully trialled in chronic and cardiovascular disease ; however , evidence to support this approach in falls prevention is limited .

BACKGROUND	Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) is the third-leading infectious cause of death worldwide .
BACKGROUND	The standard treatment of CAP has not changed for the past fifty years and its mortality and morbidity remain high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment .
BACKGROUND	Systemic corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects and are therefore discussed as adjunct treatment for CAP .
BACKGROUND	Available studies show controversial results , and the question about benefits and harms of adjunct corticosteroid therapy has not been conclusively resolved , particularly in the non-critical care setting .
METHODS	This randomized multicenter study compares a treatment with @days of prednisone @mg with placebo in adult patients hospitalized with CAP independent of severity .
METHODS	Patients are screened and enrolled within the first @hours of presentation after written informed consent is obtained .
METHODS	The primary endpoint will be time to clinical stability , which is assessed every @hours during hospitalization .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints will be , among others , all-cause mortality within @ and @days , ICU stay , duration of antibiotic treatment , disease activity scores , side effects and complications , value of adrenal function testing and prognostic hormonal and inflammatory biomarkers to predict outcome and treatment response to corticosteroids .
METHODS	Eight hundred included patients will provide an @ % power for the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint .
CONCLUSIONS	This largest to date double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial investigates the effect of adjunct glucocorticoids in @ patients with CAP requiring hospitalization .
CONCLUSIONS	It aims to give conclusive answers about benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in CAP .
CONCLUSIONS	The inclusion of less severe CAP patients will be expected to lead to a relatively low mortality rate and survival benefit might not be shown .
CONCLUSIONS	However , our study has adequate power for the clinically relevant endpoint of clinical stability .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to discontinuing glucocorticoids without tapering after seven days , we limit duration of glucocorticoid exposition , which may reduce possible side effects .

BACKGROUND	There is increasing community and government recognition of the magnitude and impact of adolescent depression .
BACKGROUND	Family based interventions have significant potential to address known risk factors for adolescent depression and could be an effective way of engaging adolescents in treatment .
BACKGROUND	The evidence for family based treatments of adolescent depression is not well developed .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a family based intervention can reduce rates of unipolar depressive disorders in adolescents , improve family functioning and engage adolescents who are reluctant to access mental health services .
METHODS	The Family Options study will determine whether a manualized family based intervention designed to target both individual and family based factors in adolescent depression ( BEST MOOD ) will be more effective in reducing unipolar depressive disorders than an active ( standard practice ) control condition consisting of a parenting group using supportive techniques ( PAST ) .
METHODS	The study is a multicenter effectiveness randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Both interventions are delivered in group format over eight weekly sessions , of two hours per session .
METHODS	We will recruit @ adolescents ( @ to @ years old ) and their families , randomized equally to each treatment condition .
METHODS	Participants will be assessed at baseline , eight weeks and @ weeks .
METHODS	Assessment of eligibility and primary outcome will be conducted using the KID-SCID structured clinical interview via adolescent and parent self-report .
METHODS	Assessments of family mental health , functioning and therapeutic processes will also be conducted .
METHODS	Data will be analyzed using Multilevel Mixed Modeling accounting for time x treatment effects and random effects for group and family characteristics .
METHODS	This trial is currently recruiting .
METHODS	Challenges in design and implementation to-date are discussed .
METHODS	These include diagnosis and differential diagnosis of mental disorders in the context of adolescent development , non-compliance of adolescents with requirements of assessment , questionnaire completion and treatment attendance , breaking randomization , and measuring the complexity of change in the context of a family-based intervention .

BACKGROUND	Obesity is a leading risk factor for endometrial cancer ( EC ) , particularly Type I forms , which are increasing in the U.S. Although death rates from most cancers have been decreasing , overall mortality in EC is increasing in the U.S. EC survivors ' poor fitness combined with their surgical treatments may make weight loss particularly challenging .
BACKGROUND	High intensity exercise increases neurotrophins and neurological reward via altered striatal dopamine in animals , and , in humans , chronic high intensity exercise enhances meal-induced satiety and may reduce hedonic eating .
BACKGROUND	`` Assisted '' exercise , a mode of exercise whereby a patient 's voluntary exercise rate is augmented mechanically , may modulate brain dopamine levels in Parkinson 's Disease patients but has not been previously evaluated as a treatment for obesity .
METHODS	We describe the rationale and design of the REWARD trial , which has the overarching goal of randomizing @ obese EC survivors to `` assisted '' or voluntary rate cycling to evaluate the efficacy of `` assisted '' exercise in enhancing and sustaining weight loss .
METHODS	Patients in both arms will receive @ days/week of supervised exercise and @ day/week of a group dietary behavioral intervention for @ weeks and , then , will be followed for @ months .
RESULTS	The primary outcome is weight loss .
RESULTS	Secondary outcomes include measures for body composition , fitness , eating behavior , exercise motivation and , quality of life as well as cognition and food reward and motivation as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) tasks .
CONCLUSIONS	If successful , the REWARD program could be extended to help sustain weight loss in obese cancer and non-cancer patients .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple dyadic ( person with dementia and their main carer ) exercise regimen as a therapy for the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia .
METHODS	A two arm , pragmatic , randomised , controlled , single-blind , parallel-group trial of a dyadic exercise regimen ( individually tailored walking regimen designed to become progressively intensive and last between @-@min , at least five times per week ) .
METHODS	Community-dwelling individuals with ICD-@ confirmed dementia with the following : clinically significant behavioural and psychological symptoms , a carer willing and able to co-participate in the exercise regimen , and no physical conditions or symptoms that would preclude exercise participation were invited by mental health or primary care services into the study .
RESULTS	One hundred and thirty-one dyads were recruited to this study .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory at week @ between the group receiving the dyadic exercise regimen and those that did not ( adjusted difference in means ( intervention minus control ) = -@ , p = @ , @ % CI -LSB- -@ , @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant between-group difference in caregiver 's burden as measured by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory at week @ ( OR = @ , p = @ , CI -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ) favouring the exercise group .
CONCLUSIONS	This study found that regular simple exercise does not appear to improve the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia , but did seem to attenuate caregiver burden .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study to improve exercise uptake are needed .

BACKGROUND	Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods such as cocoa and tea may reduce cardiovascular disease risk .
BACKGROUND	The flavonoids epicatechin ( in cocoa and tea ) and quercetin ( in tea ) probably play a role by reducing endothelial dysfunction and inflammation , @ main determinants of atherosclerosis .
OBJECTIVE	We studied the effects of supplementation of pure epicatechin and quercetin on biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation .
METHODS	Thirty-seven apparently healthy ( pre ) hypertensive men and women ( @-@ y ) participated in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial .
METHODS	Participants ingested ( - ) - epicatechin ( @ mg/d ) , quercetin-@-glucoside ( @ mg/d ) , or placebo capsules for a period of @ wk , in random order .
METHODS	Plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation were measured at the start and end of each @-wk intervention period .
METHODS	The differences in changes over time between the intervention and placebo periods ( intervention - placebo ) were calculated and tested with a linear mixed model for repeated measures .
RESULTS	Epicatechin changed epicatechin - placebo for soluble endothelial selectin ( sE-selectin ) by -@ ng/mL ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ; P = @ ) but did not significantly change this difference ( -@ ; @ % CI : -@ , @ ; P = @ ) for the z score for endothelial dysfunction .
RESULTS	Quercetin changed quercetin - placebo for sE-selectin by -@ ng/mL ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ; P = @ ) , that for IL-@ by -@ pg/mL ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ; P = @ ) , and that for the z score for inflammation by -@ ( @ % CI : -@ , -@ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In ( pre ) hypertensive men and women , epicatechin may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of cocoa and tea through improvements in endothelial function .
CONCLUSIONS	Quercetin may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of tea possibly by improving endothelial function and reducing inflammation .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Muscle passive contraction of lower limb by neuromuscular electrostimulation ( NMES ) is frequently used in chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patients but no data are available concerning its action on sympathetic activity .
BACKGROUND	However , Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) is able to improve baroreflex in CHF .
BACKGROUND	The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effect of TENS and NMES compared to Sham stimulation on sympathetic overactivity as assessed by Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity ( MSNA ) .
METHODS	We performed a serie of two parallel , randomized , double blinded and sham controlled protocols in twenty-two CHF patients in New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III .
METHODS	Half of them performed stimulation by TENS , and the others tested NMES .
RESULTS	Compare to Sham stimulation , both TENS and NMES are able to reduce MSNA ( @ @ vs @ @ bursts / min , p < @ after TENS and @ @ vs @ @ bursts / min , p < @ , @ after NMES ) .
RESULTS	No variation of blood pressure , heart rate or respiratory parameters was observed after stimulation .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that sensory stimulation of lower limbs by electrical device , either TENS or NMES , could inhibit sympathetic outflow directed to legs in CHF patients .
CONCLUSIONS	These properties could benefits CHF patients and pave the way for a new non-pharmacological approach of CHF .

BACKGROUND	Although the majority of smokers are ambivalent about quitting , few treatments specifically target smokers lacking motivation to quit in the near future .
BACKGROUND	Most existing interventions are instead predicated on the belief that active treatments should only be distributed to smokers interested in quitting , a largely untested assumption .
METHODS	In the current clinical trial ( N = @ ) , motivated smokers wanting to quit in the next @ days were given a @-week nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) sample and a referral to a quitline ( Group MNQ ) , while unmotivated smokers were randomized to receive the same treatment ( Group UNQ ) or a quitline referral only ( Group UQ ) .
METHODS	Participants were tracked via telephone for @ months to assess quitting behaviors and smoking reduction .
RESULTS	Groups significantly differed across all comparisons with regard to incidence of any quit attempt ( MNQ : @ % , UNQ : @ % , UQ : @ % , p < @ ) and any @-hr quit attempts ( @ % , @ % , @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Clinically meaningful differences emerged in the rates of floating ( @ % , @ % , @ % ) and point prevalence abstinence ( @ % , @ % , @ % ) .
RESULTS	Compared to participants in Group UQ ( @ % ) , a greater proportion of participants in Group MNQ ( @ % , p = @ ) and Group UNQ ( @ % , p = @ ) reduced their daily cigarette consumption by at least half .
RESULTS	Proxy measures of cessation readiness ( e.g. , motivation ) favored participants receiving active forms of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing NRT samples engaged both motivated and unmotivated smokers into the quitting process and produced positive changes in smoking outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that motivation should not be considered a necessary precondition to receiving treatment .

BACKGROUND	Emerging antimalarial drug resistance in mobile populations remains a significant public health concern .
BACKGROUND	We compared two regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in military and civilians on the Thai-Cambodian border to evaluate national treatment policy .
METHODS	Efficacy and safety of two and three-day regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were compared as a nested open-label evaluation within a malaria cohort study in @ otherwise healthy volunteers ( @ % malaria-infected at baseline ) .
METHODS	The first @ volunteers with slide-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum or vivax malaria were randomized @:@ to receive either regimen ( total dose @ mg dihydroartemisinin and @ mg piperaquine ) and followed weekly for up to @ months .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was malaria recurrence by day @ .
METHODS	Volunteers with vivax infection received primaquine at study discharge with six months follow-up .
RESULTS	Eighty patients ( @ vivax , @ falciparum , and @ mixed ) were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine .
RESULTS	Intention-to-treat all-species efficacy at Day @ was @ % for the two-day regimen ( @ % CI @-@ ) and @ % for the three-day regimen ( @ % CI @-@ ) .
RESULTS	PCR-adjusted falciparum efficacy was @ % in both groups with nearly half ( @ % ) still parasitemic at Day @ .
RESULTS	Plasma piperaquine levels were comparable to prior published reports , but on the day of recrudescence were below measurable in vitro piperaquine IC@ levels in all falciparum treatment failures .
CONCLUSIONS	In the brief period since introduction of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine , there is early evidence suggesting declining efficacy relative to previous reports .
CONCLUSIONS	Parasite IC@ levels in excess of plasma piperaquine levels seen only in treatment failures raises concern for clinically significant piperaquine resistance in Cambodia .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings warrant improved monitoring of clinical outcomes and follow-up , given few available alternative drugs .

OBJECTIVE	Screening for lung cancer has the potential to reduce mortality , but in addition to detecting aggressive tumors , screening will also detect indolent tumors that otherwise may not cause clinical symptoms .
OBJECTIVE	These overdiagnosis cases represent an important potential harm of screening because they incur additional cost , anxiety , and morbidity associated with cancer treatment .
OBJECTIVE	To estimate overdiagnosis in the National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) .
METHODS	We used data from the NLST , a randomized trial comparing screening using low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT ) vs chest radiography ( CXR ) among @ persons at high risk for lung cancer observed for @ years , to estimate the excess number of lung cancers in the LDCT arm of the NLST compared with the CXR arm .
METHODS	We calculated @ measures of overdiagnosis : the probability that a lung cancer detected by screening with LDCT is an overdiagnosis ( PS ) , defined as the excess lung cancers detected by LDCT divided by all lung cancers detected by screening in the LDCT arm ; and the number of cases that were considered overdiagnosis relative to the number of persons needed to screen to prevent @ death from lung cancer .
RESULTS	During follow-up , @ lung cancers were reported in the LDCT arm and @ in the CXR arm of the NLST .
RESULTS	The probability is @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) that any lung cancer detected by screening with LDCT was an overdiagnosis , @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) that a non-small cell lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis , and @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) that a bronchioalveolar lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis .
RESULTS	The number of cases of overdiagnosis found among the @ participants who would need to be screened in the NLST to prevent @ death from lung cancer was @ .
CONCLUSIONS	More than @ % of all lung cancers detected by LDCT in the NLST seem to be indolent , and overdiagnosis should be considered when describing the risks of LDCT screening for lung cancer .

OBJECTIVE	The portion size of food is a determinant of energy intake , linking with obese traits .
OBJECTIVE	A healthy plate for portion control has recently been made in a Japanese style .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention program using the Japanese-style healthy plate on weight reduction in overweight and obese diabetic Japanese subjects .
METHODS	We randomized overweight and obese diabetic subjects ( n = @ , @ women ) into an intervention group including educational classes on lifestyle modification incorporating the healthy plate ( n = @ ) or a waiting-list control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The intervention period was three months , and the educational classes using the healthy plate were conducted monthly in a group session for the intervention group .
METHODS	The body weight , blood glycemic and metabolic measures , and psychosocial variables were measured at the baseline and after the @-month intervention in both groups .
METHODS	The impression of the intervention was interviewed using a structured questionnaire .
RESULTS	There was one drop-out in the control group .
RESULTS	No adverse events were reported in the groups .
RESULTS	Subjects in the intervention group had a greater weight change from baseline to the end of the @-month intervention period ( -@ + / - @ -LSB- SD -RSB- kg in the intervention group vs. -@ + / - @ kg in the control group , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Most subjects recorded that the use of a healthy plate could be recommended to other people .
CONCLUSIONS	The lifestyle intervention program using the Japanese-style healthy plate , which was developed for portion control , may effectively reduce body weight in overweight and obese diabetic subjects in Japan .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this methodology on weight management .

BACKGROUND	In surgical procedures , obesity is a risk factor for the onset of intra and postoperative respiratory complications .
OBJECTIVE	Determine what moment of application of positive pressure brings better benefits on lung function , incidence of atelectasis and diaphragmatic excursion , in the preoperative , intraoperative or immediate postoperative period .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled , blinded study , conducted in a hospital and included subjects with BMI between @ and @ kg/m@ , @ and @ years , underwent bariatric surgery by laparotomy .
METHODS	They were underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluations .
METHODS	They were allocated into four different groups : @ ) Gpre : treated with positive pressure in the BiPAP mode ( Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure ) before surgery for one hour ; @ ) Gpos : BIPAP after surgery for one hour ; @ ) Gintra : PEEP ( Positive End Expiratory Pressure ) at @ cmH@O during the surgery ; @ ) Gcontrol : only conventional respiratory physiotherapy .
METHODS	The evaluation consisted of anthropometric data , pulmonary function tests and chest radiography .
RESULTS	Were allocated @ patients , @ in each group .
RESULTS	There were significant differences for the expiratory reserve volume and percentage of the predicted expiratory reserve volume , in which the groups that received treatment showed a smaller loss in expiratory reserve volume from the preoperative to postoperative stages .
RESULTS	The postoperative radiographic analysis showed a @ % prevalence of atelectasis for Gcontrol , @ % for Gintra , @ % for Gpre , and @ % for Gpos .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in diaphragmatic mobility amongst the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The optimal time of application of positive pressure is in the immediate postoperative period , immediately after extubation , because it reduces the incidence of atelectasis and there is reduction of loss of expiratory reserve volume .

###26178727
BACKGROUND	Biomarkers of micronutrient status are needed to best define deficiencies and excesses of essential nutrients .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated several supporting biomarkers of vitamin A status in Zambian children to determine whether any of the biomarkers were consistent with high liver retinol stores determined by using retinol isotope dilution ( RID ) .
METHODS	A randomized , placebo-controlled , biofortified maize efficacy trial was conducted in @ rural Zambian children from @ villages .
METHODS	A series of biomarkers were investigated to better define the vitamin A status of these children .
METHODS	In addition to the assessment of total-body retinol stores ( TBSs ) by using RID , tests included analyses of serum carotenoids , retinyl esters , and pyridoxal-@ ' - phosphate ( PLP ) by using high-pressure liquid chromatography , retinol-binding protein by using ELISA , and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) activity by using a colorimetric assay .
RESULTS	Children ( n = @ ) were analyzed quantitatively for TBSs by using RID .
RESULTS	TBSs , retinyl esters , some carotenoids , and PLP differed by village site .
RESULTS	Serum carotenoids were elevated above most nonintervened reference values for children .
RESULTS	- Carotene , - carotene , and lutein values were > @th percentile from children in the US NHANES III , and @ % of children had hypercarotenemia ( defined as total carotenoid concentration > @ mol/L ) .
RESULTS	Although only @ % of children had serum retinyl esters > @ % of total retinol plus retinyl esters , @ % of children had > @ % as esters , which was consistent with high liver retinol stores .
RESULTS	Ratios of serum retinol to retinol-binding protein did not deviate from @ , which indicated full saturation .
RESULTS	ALT activity was low , which was likely due to underlying vitamin B-@ deficiency , which was confirmed by very low serum PLP concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	The finding of hypervitaminosis A in Zambian children was supported by high circulating concentrations of carotenoids and mildly elevated serum retinyl esters .
CONCLUSIONS	ALT-activity assays may be compromised with co-existing vitamin B-@ deficiency .
CONCLUSIONS	Nutrition education to improve intakes of whole grains and animal-source foods may enhance vitamin B-@ status in Zambians .

BACKGROUND	Surgical site infection ( SSI ) is the second most common type of nosocomial infections in the United States .
BACKGROUND	In Uruguay , the incidence after prostatectomies is @ % .
BACKGROUND	The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of two skin antiseptics and to determine possible risk factors for SSI in patients undergoing surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .
METHODS	A randomized trial included @ patients operated on for BPH , of whom @ ( @ % ) underwent open surgery .
METHODS	Patients were treated by the same surgical team in a tertiary general hospital that is a referral center for patients with urologic diseases .
METHODS	Skin antisepsis was performed randomly using either @ % povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine in an alcohol base ( Chemisol ( ) ) .
METHODS	Possible risk factors investigated were age , renal dysfunction , bladder stones , preoperative urinary catheter , positive preoperative urine culture , operative time and technique , and vesicocutaneous fistula .
RESULTS	Of all patients , @ ( @ % ) had a urinary catheter preoperatively .
RESULTS	Urine cultures were positive in @ patients , of whom @ ( @ % ) had a urinary catheter .
RESULTS	Surgical site infection occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) , and @ % of the causative microorganisms were gram-negative bacteria characteristic of the urinary flora .
RESULTS	The type of antiseptic did not affect the risk of SSI ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The most important risk factor for infection was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively ( p = @ ) ; also significant were the formation of a vesicocutaneous fistula ( p = @ ) , increasing age ( p = @ ) , and the presence of a positive preoperative urine culture ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In a cohort of patients submitted to open prostatectomy , SSI was not related to the type of antiseptic .
CONCLUSIONS	The main risk factor was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively .
CONCLUSIONS	All microorganisms isolated from the SSIs were characteristic of urinary tract infections .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the conception rate to fixed-time artificial insemination ( FTAI ) of two oestrus synchronisation programmes in dairy heifers on eight farms over @ years .
METHODS	The study was conducted in @ and @ on eight farms near Palmerston North , New Zealand .
METHODS	Nulliparous Friesian and FriesianJersey heifers ( @-@ months of age ) were randomly allocated to one of two oestrus synchronisation programmes .
METHODS	Group @ ( GPG+P @ ; n = @ ) , received gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) I/M on Day @ , a progesterone ( P@ ) - releasing intravaginal device from Days @-@ , prostaglandin F@ ( PGF ) I/M on Day @ and a second dose of GnRH at the time of FTAI on Day @ .
METHODS	The second group ( P@ + PGF ; n = @ ) received a P@-releasing intravaginal device from Days @-@ , PGF on Day @ and FTAI on Day @ .
METHODS	Pregnancy was diagnosed from Days @-@ by transrectal ultrasonography .
RESULTS	The overall conception rate was @ % and @ % for the GPG+P @ and P@ + PGF groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The odds of conception for the two treatments were not different ( OR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) , nor was there any difference between groups in different years ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Farm affected conception rate ( p = @ ) , but there was no interaction with treatment ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study has shown that an alternative synchronisation programme can produce similar results in terms of conception rate to the GPG+P @ treatment , currently commonly used in heifers .
CONCLUSIONS	More research is required to establish whether other modifications to the GPG+P @ programme can produce similar results at lower costs , and to identify and quantify farm factors which affect the economic benefit of heifer synchronisation .
CONCLUSIONS	This study indicated that synchronising heifers with P@ and PGF resulted in conception rates equivalent to those resulting from a GPG+P @ treatment , but with reduced drug costs .
CONCLUSIONS	However , because heifers in the GPG+P @ group received the second GnRH injection at the time of AI , they needed only three yardings as opposed to the four required for the heifers treated with P@ and PGF .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , the choice of programme for an individual farm will depend on that farm 's circumstances , in particular the cost of yarding the heifers .

BACKGROUND	Efficacy and safety are the two considerations when characterising the effects of a new therapy .
BACKGROUND	We sought to apply an innovative method of assessing the benefit-risk balance using data from a completed randomised controlled trial that compared erlotinib vs placebo added to gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer ( NCIC CTG PA. @ ) .
METHODS	We applied generalised pairwise comparisons with several prioritised outcome measures ( e.g. , one or more benefit outcomes and one or more risk outcomes ) .
METHODS	Here , the first priority outcome was overall survival ( OS ) time .
METHODS	Differences in OS that exceeded @ months were considered clinically meaningful .
METHODS	The second priority outcome was toxicity .
METHODS	The overall treatment effect was quantified using the proportion in favour of erlotinib , which can be interpreted as the net proportion of patients who have a better overall outcome with erlotinib as compared with placebo .
METHODS	Sensitivity analyses were performed .
RESULTS	In this trial @ patients were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to receive gemcitabine plus either erlotinib or a matched placebo .
RESULTS	Overall , the method indicated no statistically significant overall treatment effect in favour of erlotinib ; if anything , the point estimate of the net proportion leaned in favour of the placebo group ( overall proportion in favour of erlotinib = -@ % , @ % CI , -@ - @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The net proportion was never in favour of the erlotinib group throughout all sensitivity analyses .
CONCLUSIONS	Generalised pairwise comparisons make it possible to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments using a single statistical test for any number of prioritised outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefit-risk assessment was not in favour of adding erlotinib to gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer .

BACKGROUND	Sedation using intranasal dexmedetomidine is a convenient and well-tolerated technique .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the sedative efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine in combination with patient-controlled sedation ( PCS ) for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
METHODS	In this double-blind , randomised , controlled trial , @ patients received either intranasal dexmedetomidine @ g/kg ( dexmedetomidine group ) or intranasal saline ( placebo group ) @h before the procedure .
METHODS	PCS with propofol and alfentanil was provided for rescue sedation .
METHODS	Additional sedative consumption , perioperative sedation scores using Observer 's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation ( OAA/S ) scale , recovery , vital signs , adverse events and patient satisfaction were assessed .
RESULTS	Total consumption of PCS propofol and alfentanil was significantly less in the dexmedetomidine than placebo group with a mean difference of -@ mg propofol ( @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ ) and -@ g alfentanil ( @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ ) at the completion of the procedure ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Weighted areas under the curve ( AUCw ) of OAA/S scores were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group before , during and after procedures ( P < @ , P = @ and P = @ respectively ) .
RESULTS	AUCw of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were also significantly lower during the procedure ( P = @ and P = @ respectively ) with dexmedetomidine .
RESULTS	There was no difference in recovery , side effects or satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	Intranasal dexmedetomidine with PCS propofol and alfentanil confers deeper perioperative clinical sedation with significantly less use of additional sedatives during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .

OBJECTIVE	To develop a mathematical model to adjust the timing of computed tomography ( CT ) scans with the hazard of cancer recurrence in time to facilitate early detection of cancer recurrence .
METHODS	The clinical data were extracted from the randomized Scandinavian Sarcoma Group ( SSG ) XVIII/Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie ( AIO ) trial database .
METHODS	The SSG XVIII/AIO trial was registered ( trial no .
METHODS	NCT@ ) and approved by the national or institutional review boards .
METHODS	In the trial , @ - and @-year durations of adjuvant imatinib mesylate in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) were compared .
METHODS	A nonhomogeneous Poisson model with a piecewise log-constant hazard in time that accounts for the nonlinear pattern of GIST recurrence was applied to tumor site , mitotic count , and recurrence data .
METHODS	The optimal times to obtain follow-up CT scans were computed by modifying the frequency of CT scans with the hazard of tumor recurrence in time .
METHODS	The hazard-adjusted follow-up schedules were compared with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines of the United States , which suggest imaging with CT at intervals of @-@ months for @-@ years and then annually .
RESULTS	Optimized timing of CT scans on the basis of hazard of recurrence resulted in follow-up schedule options where CT is performed more sparsely than in the NCCN guidelines during adjuvant imatinib administration and more frequently , at approximately @-month intervals , during the first @ years that follow imatinib discontinuation when the risk of recurrence was the greatest .
RESULTS	The number of CT scans could be reduced by a median of @ % ( from @ to nine ) compared with the standard schedules within the first @ years of follow-up without increasing the delay in recurrence detection .
CONCLUSIONS	Detection of GIST recurrence may be enhanced by adjusting the timing of the CT scans with the hazard of recurrence .
CONCLUSIONS	The method may be applicable to other human tumor types .
CONCLUSIONS	Online supplemental material is available for this article .

BACKGROUND	In the field of intelligence research , it has been shown that some people conceive intelligence as a fixed trait that can not be changed ( entity beliefs ) , whereas others conceive it as a malleable trait that can be developed ( incremental beliefs ) .
BACKGROUND	What about writing ?
BACKGROUND	Do people hold similar implicit theories about the nature of their writing ability ?
BACKGROUND	Furthermore , are these beliefs likely to influence students ' response to a writing intervention ?
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to develop a scale to measure students ' implicit theories of writing ( pilot study ) and to test whether these beliefs influence strategy-instruction effectiveness ( intervention study ) .
METHODS	In the pilot and intervention studies participated , respectively , @ and @ students ( Grades @-@ ) .
METHODS	Based on existing instruments that measure self-theories of intelligence , we developed the Implicit Theories of Writing ( ITW ) scale that was tested with the pilot sample .
METHODS	In the intervention study , @ students received planning instruction based on the self-regulated strategy development model , whereas @ students received standard writing instruction .
METHODS	Students were evaluated before , in the middle , and after instruction .
RESULTS	ITW 's validity was supported by piloting results and their successful cross-validation in the intervention study .
RESULTS	In this , intervention students wrote longer and better texts than control students .
RESULTS	Moreover , latent growth curve modelling showed that the more the intervention students conceived writing as a malleable skill , the more the quality of their texts improved .
CONCLUSIONS	This research is of educational relevance because it provides a measure to evaluate students ' implicit theories of writing and shows their impact on response to intervention .

BACKGROUND	Acetaminophen ( APAP ) by oral or intravenous ( iv ) routes is used for mild to moderate pain but may take time to be effective .
BACKGROUND	When fast relief is required and/or oral or iv routes are not available because of the patient 's condition , the transmucosal route may be an alternative .
METHODS	A new transmucosal/buccal ( b ) pharmaceutical form of APAP dissolved in @ % wt alcohol is compared with other routes of administration .
METHODS	Two consecutive randomized , crossover , double-blind clinical trials ( CT@ : NCT@ and CT@ : NCT@ ) included @ healthy volunteers .
METHODS	CT@ compared the pharmacology of @ mg bAPAP with @ g iv APAP .
METHODS	CT@ compared the pharmacodynamics of @ mg bAPAP with @ g iv and @ mg sublingual ( s ) APAP .
METHODS	Mechanical pain thresholds are recorded in response to mechanical stimuli applied on the forearm several times during @ minutes .
METHODS	The objective is to compare the time of onset of antinociception and the antinociception ( area under the curve ) between the routes of administration with analysis of variance ( significance P < @ ) .
RESULTS	bAPAP has a faster time of antinociception onset ( @ minutes , P < @ ) and greater antinociception at @ minutes ( P < @ , CT@ ) and @ minutes ( P < @ , CT@ ) than ivAPAP and sAPAP .
RESULTS	All routes are similar after @ minutes .
CONCLUSIONS	bAPAP has a faster antinociceptive action in healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	This attractive alternative to other routes would be useful in situations where oral or iv routes are not available .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding must now be confirmed in patients suffering from acute pain of mild and moderate intensity .

OBJECTIVE	To compare toric intraocular lens implantation ( Toric-IOL ) with peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( PCRIs ) for astigmatism correction in patients undergoing cataract surgery .
METHODS	@ patients ( @ eyes ) with more than @ diopter ( D ) of preexisting corneal astigmatism were classified as group A ( @-@ @ D ) or group B ( @-@ @ D ) .
METHODS	The patients were randomized to undergo Toric-IOL or PCRIs in the steep axis with spherical IOL implantation .
METHODS	LogMAR uncorrected visual acuity ( LogMAR UCVA ) , LogMAR best corrected visual acuity ( LogMAR BCVA ) , error of vector ( | EV | ) , surgery induced refraction correction ( | SIRC | ) , and correction rates ( CR ) were measured @ month and @ months postoperatively .
RESULTS	At @ months postoperatively , all @ eyes had LogMAR BCVA @ .
RESULTS	Patients who underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL with LogMAR BCVA @ showed no significant differences in group A ( P = @ ) or in group B ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Group A showed no significant differences in LogMAR UCVA ( P = @ ) , | EV | ( P = @ ) , | SIRC | ( P = @ ) , and CR ( P = @ ) in patients underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL .
RESULTS	However , group B showed significant differences in LogMAR UCVA ( P < @ ) , | EV | ( P < @ ) ) , | SIRC | ( P < @ ) , and CR ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The LogMAR UCVA and | EV | between @ and @ months showed no significant differences in patients in group A. However , in group B , they are significant differences .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy and stability of Toric-IOL and PCRIs were equal in low astigmatic patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Toric-IOL achieved an enhanced effect over PCRIs in higher astigmatic patients .
CONCLUSIONS	PCRIs had the more refractive regression than Toric-IOL in @ months .

BACKGROUND	Inhibition of angiogenesis is a valuable treatment strategy for ovarian cancer .
BACKGROUND	Pazopanib is an anti-angiogenic drug active in ovarian cancer .
BACKGROUND	We assessed the effect of adding pazopanib to paclitaxel for patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory advanced ovarian cancer .
METHODS	We did this open-label , randomised phase @ trial at @ hospitals in Italy .
METHODS	We included patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer previously treated with a maximum of two lines of chemotherapy , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status @-@ , and no residual peripheral neurotoxicity .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive weekly paclitaxel @ mg/m ( @ ) with or without pazopanib @ mg daily , and stratified by centre , number of previous lines of chemotherapy , and platinum-free interval status .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival , assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
METHODS	This report is the final analysis ; the trial is completed .
RESULTS	Between Dec @ , @ , and Feb @ , @ , we enrolled @ patients : @ were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel and pazopanib and @ were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel only .
RESULTS	One patient , in the paclitaxel only group , withdrew from the study and was excluded from analyses .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the pazopanib plus paclitaxel group than in the paclitaxel only group ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; hazard ratio @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	We recorded no unexpected toxic effects or deaths from toxic effects .
RESULTS	Adverse events were more common in the pazopanib and paclitaxel group than in the paclitaxel only group .

BACKGROUND	Clinical mood disorders often become clinically manifest in the later teenage years and early twenties and can be associated with a poor long-term prognosis .
BACKGROUND	The primary prevention of these disorders would therefore have great public health value .
BACKGROUND	Nutritional supplements are a feasible intervention for primary prevention and several epidemiological studies have indicated links between low folate status and depressive symptomatology in the general population .
METHODS	A randomised , double blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial in which participants , aged @-@ years , at increased familial risk of mood disorder , were randomised to folic acid ( @ mg daily ) or identical placebo liquid for a maximum of @ months .
METHODS	Primary outcome data ( the onset of a DSM-IV mood disorder ) were collected from @ participants ; @ per group .
RESULTS	The incidence of mood disorder in the folic acid and placebo groups were @ % and @ % respectively , a non-significant difference .
RESULTS	However , there was post-hoc evidence that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell .
CONCLUSIONS	Small sample size and rate of onset of mood disorders lower than expected .
CONCLUSIONS	Although long term folic acid supplementation was well tolerated , with high levels of adherence , there was no evidence that it reduced the incidence of mood disorder compared to those taking placebo .

BACKGROUND	A third of the @ billion people worldwide without access to improved sanitation live in India , as do two-thirds of the @ billion practising open defecation and a quarter of the @ million who die annually from diarrhoeal diseases .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a rural sanitation intervention , within the context of the Government of India 's Total Sanitation Campaign , to prevent diarrhoea , soil-transmitted helminth infection , and child malnutrition .
METHODS	We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial between May @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , in @ rural villages in Odisha , India .
METHODS	Households within villages were eligible if they had a child younger than @ years or a pregnant woman .
METHODS	Villages were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) , with a computer-generated sequence , to undergo latrine promotion and construction or to receive no intervention ( control ) .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by administrative block to ensure an equal number of intervention and control villages in each block .
METHODS	Masking of participants was not possible because of the nature of the intervention .
METHODS	However , households were not told explicitly that the purpose of enrolment was to study the effect of a trial intervention , and the surveillance team was different from the intervention team .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was @-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than @ years .
METHODS	We did intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned @ villages to the intervention group and @ villages to the control group .
RESULTS	There were @ households ( @,@ individuals ) in intervention villages and @ households ( @,@ individuals ) in control villages .
RESULTS	The intervention increased mean village-level latrine coverage from @ % of households to @ % , compared with an increase from @ % to @ % in control villages .
RESULTS	Health surveillance data were obtained from @ households with children younger than @ years in the intervention group ( @ children younger than @ years ) , and from @ households ( @ children younger than @ years ) in the control group .
RESULTS	@-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than @ years was @ % in the intervention group and @ % in the control group ( period prevalence ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ) .
RESULTS	@ participants died in the intervention group ( @ children younger than @ years ) and @ died in the control group ( @ children younger than @ years ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased latrine coverage is generally believed to be effective for reducing exposure to faecal pathogens and preventing disease ; however , our results show that this outcome can not be assumed .
CONCLUSIONS	As efforts to improve sanitation are being undertaken worldwide , approaches should not only meet international coverage targets , but should also be implemented in a way that achieves uptake , reduces exposure , and delivers genuine health gains .

OBJECTIVE	To test the effectiveness of an integrated collaborative care model for people with depression and long term physical conditions .
METHODS	Cluster randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	@ general practices in the north west of England .
METHODS	@ patients with a record of diabetes or heart disease , or both , who had depressive symptoms ( @ on patient health questionaire-@ ( PHQ-@ ) ) for at least two weeks .
METHODS	Mean age was @ ( SD @ ) .
METHODS	Participants reported a mean of @ ( SD @ ) long term conditions other than diabetes or heart disease ; @ ( @ % ) were men ; @ ( @ % ) completed the trial .
METHODS	Collaborative care included patient preference for behavioural activation , cognitive restructuring , graded exposure , and/or lifestyle advice , management of drug treatment , and prevention of relapse .
METHODS	Up to eight sessions of psychological treatment were delivered by specially trained psychological wellbeing practitioners employed by Improving Access to Psychological Therapy services in the English National Health Service ; integration of care was enhanced by two treatment sessions delivered jointly with the practice nurse .
METHODS	Usual care was standard clinical practice provided by general practitioners and practice nurses .
METHODS	The primary outcome was reduction in symptoms of depression on the self reported symptom checklist-@ depression scale ( SCL-D@ ) at four months after baseline assessment .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms ( generalised anxiety disorder @ ) , self management ( health education impact questionnaire ) , disability ( Sheehan disability scale ) , and global quality of life ( WHOQOL-BREF ) .
RESULTS	@ general practices were randomised to collaborative care and @ to usual care ; three practices withdrew from the trial before patients were recruited .
RESULTS	@ patients were recruited from practices allocated to collaborative care , and @ from practices allocated to usual care .
RESULTS	After adjustment for baseline depression score , mean depressive scores were @ SCL-D@ points lower ( @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ ) in the collaborative care arm , equal to an adjusted standardised effect size of @ .
RESULTS	Patients in the intervention arm also reported being better self managers , rated their care as more patient centred , and were more satisfied with their care .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between groups in quality of life , disease specific quality of life , self efficacy , disability , and social support .
CONCLUSIONS	Collaborative care that incorporates brief low intensity psychological therapy delivered in partnership with practice nurses in primary care can reduce depression and improve self management of chronic disease in people with mental and physical multimorbidity .
CONCLUSIONS	The size of the treatment effects were modest and were less than the prespecified effect but were achieved in a trial run in routine settings with a deprived population with high levels of mental and physical multimorbidity .

BACKGROUND	Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) in schoolchildren offers a promising option for malaria control .
BACKGROUND	However , the optimal drug and dosing regimens for IPT remain to be determined .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in @ schoolchildren aged @-@ years living in a setting of high malaria transmission in Uganda .
METHODS	Enrolled children were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) given once a month ( IPTm ) , DP given once a school term ( @ treatments over @ months , IPTst ) , or placebo and followed for @ months .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the incidence of malaria over @ months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included parasite prevalence and anemia over @ months .
METHODS	Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis .
RESULTS	In the placebo arm , the incidence of malaria was @ episodes per person-year and the prevalence of parasitemia and anemia was @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	IPTm reduced the incidence of malaria by @ % ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ % -@ % , P < @ ) , the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % , P < @ ) , and the prevalence of anemia by @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	IPTst had no significant effect on the incidence of symptomatic malaria or the prevalence of anemia , but reduced the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Monthly IPT with DP offered remarkable protection against clinical malaria , parasitemia , and anemia in schoolchildren living in a high-malaria-transmission setting .

OBJECTIVE	To establish the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in ovine gastrointestinal nematodes in southern Queensland .
METHODS	An observational parasitological study using the faecal egg count reduction test .
METHODS	Sheep farms ( n = @ ) enrolled in this study met the twin criteria of using worm testing for drench decisions and having concerns about anthelmintic efficacy .
METHODS	On each farm , @ sheep were randomly allocated to one of six treatment groups or an untreated control group .
METHODS	Faecal samples were collected on day @ and days @-@ for worm egg counts and larval differentiation .
METHODS	Single - and multi-combination anthelmintics , persistent and non-persistent , oral liquid or capsule , pour-on and injectable formulations were tested .
METHODS	Monepantel was not tested .
METHODS	Farmers also responded to a questionnaire on drenching practices .
RESULTS	Haemonchus contortus was the predominant species .
RESULTS	Efficacy < @ % was recorded on @ % of farms for one or more anthelmintics and on @ % of farms for six anthelmintics .
RESULTS	No resistance was identified on three farms .
RESULTS	The @-way combination product was efficacious ( n = @ farms ) .
RESULTS	Napthalophos resistance was detected on one farm only .
RESULTS	Resistance to levamisole ( @ % of farms ) , moxidectin injection ( @ % of farms ) and the closantel/abamectin combination ( @ % of farms ) was identified .
RESULTS	Moxidectin oral was efficacious against Trichostrongylus colubriformis , which was predominant on only one farm .
RESULTS	Of the farms tested , @ % ran meat breeds , @ % dosed more than the recommended dose rate and @ % always , mostly or when possible practised a ` drench and move ' strategy .
CONCLUSIONS	This level of anthelmintic resistance in southern Queensland will severely compromise worm control and force increased use of monepantel .

BACKGROUND	Caudal block ( CB ) has some disadvantages , one of which is its short duration of action after a single injection .
BACKGROUND	For hypospadias repair , pudendal nerve block ( PNB ) might be a suitable alternative since it has been successfully used for analgesia for circumcision .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated PNB compared with CB as measured by total analgesic consumption @ hours postoperatively .
METHODS	In this prospective , double-blinded study , patients were randomized into @ groups , either receiving CB or nerve stimulator-guided PNB .
METHODS	In the PNB group , patients were injected with @ mL/kg @ % bupivacaine and @ g/kg clonidine .
METHODS	In the CB group , patients were injected with @ mL/kg @ % bupivacaine and @ g/kg clonidine .
METHODS	Analgesic consumption was assessed during the first @ hours postoperatively .
METHODS	The `` objective pain scale '' developed by Hannalah and Broadman was used to assess postoperative pain .
RESULTS	Eighty patients participated in the study , @ in each group .
RESULTS	The mean age in the PNB group was @ ( @ ) years and in the CB group was @ ( @ ) years .
RESULTS	The mean weights in the PNB and CB groups were @ ( @ ) kg and @ ( @ ) kg , respectively .
RESULTS	The percentage of patients who received analgesics during the first @ hours were significantly higher in the CB ( @ % ) compared with the PNB group ( @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The average amount of analgesics consumed per patient within @ hours postoperatively was higher in the CB group ( paracetamol P < @ , Tramal P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients who received PNB had reduced analgesic consumption and pain within the first @ hours postoperatively compared with CB .

OBJECTIVE	Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) self-sampling ( Self-HPV ) may be used as a primary cervical cancer screening method in a low resource setting .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate whether an educational intervention would improve women 's knowledge and confidence in the Self-HPV method .
METHODS	Women aged between @ and @ years old , eligible for cervical cancer screening , were randomly chosen to receive standard information ( control group ) or standard information followed by educational intervention ( interventional group ) .
METHODS	Standard information included explanations about what the test detects ( HPV ) , the link between HPV and cervical cancer and how to perform HPV self-sampling .
METHODS	The educational intervention consisted of a culturally tailored video about HPV , cervical cancer , Self-HPV and its relevancy as a screening test .
METHODS	All participants completed a questionnaire that assessed sociodemographic data , women 's knowledge about cervical cancer and acceptability of Self-HPV .
RESULTS	A total of @ women were enrolled in @ health care centers in Yaound and the surrounding countryside .
RESULTS	@ women ( @ in the `` control group '' and @ in the `` intervention group '' ) completed the full process and were included into the analysis .
RESULTS	Participants who received the educational intervention had a significantly higher knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer than the control group ( p < @ ) , but no significant difference on Self-HPV acceptability and confidence in the method was noticed between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Educational intervention promotes an increase in knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Further investigation should be conducted to determine if this intervention can be sustained beyond the short term and influences screening behavior .

OBJECTIVE	The benefits of combined systemic and liver-directed treatments in inoperable intermediate - or advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) have yet to be defined .
OBJECTIVE	This article presents the planned safety analyses for the first @ patients randomized to radioembolization with yttrium-@ ( ( @ ) Y ) resin microspheres followed by sorafenib ( n = @ ) or sorafenib only ( n = @ ) in the SORAMIC study .
METHODS	Patients identified for palliative treatment who were poor candidates for transarterial ( chemo ) embolization ( including those failing TACE ) with preserved liver function ( Child-Pugh B@ ) and ECOG performance status < @ were screened .
METHODS	Radioembolization was administered using a sequential lobar approach .
METHODS	On day @ after the last radioembolization procedure , sorafenib @ mg twice daily was initiated escalating to @ mg twice daily @ week later ; a matching sorafenib dose schedule was initiated in the control arm .
RESULTS	Patients were followed up for a median of @ months .
RESULTS	Median total implanted activity of ( @ ) Y was @ ( range : @-@ @ ) GBq .
RESULTS	Patients received a similar intensity and duration of sorafenib in the combination-treatment arm ( median daily dose @ mg over @ months ) and control arm ( @ mg over @ months ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of total ( @ vs. @ ) and grade @ ( @ vs. @ ) adverse events was similar in combination-treatment arm and control arm respectively ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences in the number of total or grade @/@ toxicities were recorded for : total bilirubin , albumin , liver enzymes , ascites , Child-Pugh , fatigue , hand-foot skin reaction , blood pressure or diarrhoea .
CONCLUSIONS	Radioembolization followed by sorafenib appears to be as well tolerated as sorafenib alone .

BACKGROUND	Subcutaneous drainage is considered effective for preventing wound infections , but only anecdotal evidence supports its clinical benefit .
BACKGROUND	The present study evaluated the benefit of subcutaneous drainage in preventing wound infections in patients undergoing liver resection .
METHODS	Patients scheduled for liver resection were randomly assigned to receive or not receive subcutaneous drains .
METHODS	After suture of the peritoneum and fascia , a @ Fr drain was placed subcutaneously and connected to a low pressure ( under @cmH@ O ) aspiration reservoir to allow drainage of the full length of the wound .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was wound infection development within @ days of the liver resection .
RESULTS	We performed liver resections in @ patients with hepatobiliary malignancies .
RESULTS	Between the subcutaneous-drainage group ( n = @ ) and non-drainage group ( n = @ ) , there were no significant differences in the operative variables .
RESULTS	Wound infection occurred in @ drainage group patients ( @ % ) and @ patients ( @ % ) in the non-drainage group ( P = @ ) ; there was no significant difference in the probability of wound infection ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found between the groups for the hospital stay duration ( P = @ ) , postoperative complications ( P = @ ) or medical expenses ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Subcutaneous drainage does not prevent wound infections in patients undergoing liver resection ; therefore , its routine use is not justified .

OBJECTIVE	While portable , supplemental oxygen is often necessary for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) to retain independence , it may provide functional limitations because of the increased workload imposed .
OBJECTIVE	This issue may result in nonuse , creating a need to identify carrying modalities that optimize transport .
OBJECTIVE	This study assessed the effects of @ methods of portable oxygen transport on @-minute walk distance ( @ MWD ) , rate of perceived exertion ( RPE ) , heart rate ( HR ) , and oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO@ ) .
OBJECTIVE	As weight status is known to impact functional ability in COPD , effects of body mass index ( BMI ) were also assessed .
METHODS	Data were analyzed using the mixed-model procedure to test for effects of transport modality ( reference , rolling cart , backpack , shoulderstrap ) , time ( minutes @-@ ) , BMI , non-overweight , overweight , and interactions of these variables on outcome parameters .
RESULTS	A main effect of condition was found for @ MWD , and an interaction of condition BMI was found for HR and RPE , and of time BMI for @ MWD and SpO@ .
RESULTS	Participants walked the least distance in rolling cart condition , which was also characterized by the greatest RPE .
RESULTS	For the overweight group , HR was least in the reference compared with other conditions ; but for the non-overweight group , the opposite pattern was observed .
RESULTS	At latter time points , @ MWD was greater in the non-overweight group , while SpO@ was reduced .
CONCLUSIONS	Results demonstrate that transport modality of portable oxygen exerts differential effects on functional performance in COPD patients and that BMI may moderate underlying physiologic factors that contribute to performance outcomes .

BACKGROUND	An increasing body of evidence is being published about single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC ) , but there are no well-powered trials with an adequate evaluation of post-operative pain .
BACKGROUND	This randomized trial compares SILC against four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) with post-operative pain as the primary endpoint .
METHODS	Hundred patients were randomized to either SILC ( n = @ ) or LC ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria were ( @ ) Acute cholecystitis ; ( @ ) ASA @ or above ; ( @ ) Bleeding disorders ; and ( @ ) Previous open upper abdominal surgery .
METHODS	Patients and post-operative assessors were blinded to the procedure performed .
METHODS	The site and severity of pain were compared at @ h , @ h , @ days and @ months post-procedure using the visual analog scale ; non-inferiority was assumed when the lower boundary of the @ % confidence interval of the difference was above -@ and superiority when p @ .
RESULTS	The study arms were demographically similar .
RESULTS	At @ h post-procedure , SILC was associated with less pain at extra-umbilical sites ( rest : p = @ ; movement : p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pain data were inconclusive at @ h at the umbilical site on movement ; SILC was otherwise non-inferior for pain at all other points .
RESULTS	Operating duration was longer in SILC ( @ vs @ min , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ % of patients in each arm suffered complications ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Re-intervention rates , analgesic use , return to function , and patient satisfaction did not differ significantly .
CONCLUSIONS	SILC has improved short-term pain outcomes compared to LC and is not inferior in both short-term and long-term pain outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The operating time is longer , but remains feasible in routine surgical practice .

BACKGROUND	In COPD , the long-acting bronchodilators are not always able to provide an appropriate bronchodilator effect in terms of amplitude and duration and this can result in increased severity of respiratory symptoms and in worsening of health status .
BACKGROUND	Combined long-acting bronchodilators can address this limitation .
METHODS	Analysis of a recent study evaluating the efficacy and safety of @ weeks of therapy with glycopyrronium + indacaterol single inhaler ( QVA@ ) versus each component , versus tiotropium and versus placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Such a combination can provide a superior and sustained bronchodilator effect and can minimize the respiratory symptoms resulting from a suboptimally inhibited bronchoconstriction .

BACKGROUND	Docetaxel plus prednisone is a standard treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer .
BACKGROUND	Cyclophosphamide may be an effective combination partner .
METHODS	This randomised , multicentre , phase II trial compared the combination therapy of docetaxel plus prednisone plus cyclophosphamide with the standard therapy of docetaxel plus prednisone .
RESULTS	Thirty-three patients received six @-week treatment cycles ( in total @ cycles ) .
RESULTS	During treatment , an adequate decline in prostate-specific antigen was seen in both groups ( p = @ ) without between-group differences ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No relevant differences between within-group changes were observed for blood pressure , weight , pain score , laboratory variables or quality of life .
RESULTS	There were no serious side effects apart from leucopenia requiring treatment ( docetaxel + prednisone + cyclophosphamide arm ) and no drug-related withdrawals ; all three fatalities were considered to be cancer related .
CONCLUSIONS	The oncological effectiveness and tolerability of docetaxel plus prednisone were supported ; an additional effect of cyclophosphamide was not detected .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the small number of patients and short observation period restrict the generalisability of the results .

OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to compare continuous and pulsed ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound in terms of pain , severity of muscle spasm , function , depression , and quality of life in patients with myofascial pain syndrome .
METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into three groups , including the continuous ultrasound group ( @ MHz , @ W/cm , n = @ ) , the pulsed ultrasound group ( @ MHz , @ W/cm , @:@ ratio , n = @ ) , and control group ( sham , n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were severity of pain at rest and during activity ( visual analog scale , @-@ cm ) .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measures were function ( Neck Pain and Disability Scale ) , depressive mood ( Beck Depression Scale ) , and quality of life ( Nottingham Health Profile ) .
METHODS	All evaluations were performed at baseline , after treatment , and at the @th and @th wks .
RESULTS	All three groups had significant improvements in all of the pain scores , the severity of muscle spasms , function assessments , and certain subparameters of the quality of life scale ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The continuous ultrasound group had significantly greater improvements in pain at rest ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , no statistically significant differences were observed in the other parameters ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Continuous ultrasound therapy is more efficient in reducing pain at rest for myofascial pain syndrome patients than is sham or pulsed ultrasound therapy .

BACKGROUND	Daclatasvir-containing regimens have the potential to address limitations of current regimens combining peginterferon alfa and ribavirin with first-generation protease inhibitors for treatment of chronic HCV genotype @ infection .
METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind study , @ Japanese treatment-naive patients received once-daily daclatasvir @ mg or @ mg or placebo , each combined with peginterferon alfa-@b / ribavirin ; @ prior null ( n = @ ) or partial ( n = @ ) responders received the same daclatasvir-containing regimens without a placebo arm .
METHODS	Daclatasvir recipients with protocol-defined response ( HCV RNA < @ IU/ml at week @ , undetectable at week @ ) were treated for @ weeks ; those without protocol-defined response and placebo recipients continued treatment to week @ .
RESULTS	Sustained virological response @ weeks post-treatment ( SVR@ ) was achieved by @ % , @ % and @ % of treatment-naive patients in the daclatasvir @ mg , @ mg and placebo groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Prior non-responders had more frequent virological failure ; @ % and @ % of daclatasvir @ mg and @ mg recipients , respectively , achieved SVR@ .
RESULTS	Adverse events were similar across groups and were typical of peginterferon alfa-@b / ribavirin .
RESULTS	Pyrexia , headache , alopecia , decreased appetite and malaise were the most common adverse events ; two daclatasvir recipients discontinued due to adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Daclatasvir @ mg combined with peginterferon alfa-@b and ribavirin achieved a high rate of SVR@ in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype @ infection , with tolerability similar to that of peginterferon alfa-@b / ribavirin alone .
CONCLUSIONS	However , regimens with greater antiviral potency are needed for prior non-responders .

BACKGROUND	Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is commonly accompanied by intracranial bleeding which can worsen after hospital admission .
BACKGROUND	Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) has been shown to reduce bleeding in elective surgery and there is evidence that short courses of TXA can reduce rebleeding in spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of TXA in preventing progressive intracranial haemorrhage in TBI .
METHODS	This is a double blinded , placebo controlled randomized trial .
METHODS	We enrolled @ patients older than @years with moderate to severe TBI ( post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) @ to @ ) who had a computerized tomography ( CT ) brain scan within eight hours of injury and in whom there was no immediate indication for surgery .
METHODS	We excluded patients if they had a coagulopathy or a serum creatinine over than @ milligrams % .
METHODS	The treatment was a single dose of @ grams of TXA in addition to other standard treatments .
METHODS	The primary outcome was progressive intracranial haemorrhage ( PIH ) which was defined as an intracranial haemorrhage seen on the second CT scan that was not seen on the first CT scan , or an intracranial haemorrhage seen on the first scan that had expanded by @ % or more on any dimension ( height , length , or width ) on the second scan .
RESULTS	Progressive intracranial haemorrhage was present in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients allocated to TXA and in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients allocated to placebo .
RESULTS	The difference was not statistically significant -LSB- RR = @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	There were no significant difference in the risk of death from all causes in patients allocated to TXA compared with placebo -LSB- RR = @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) -RSB- and the risk of unfavourable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale -LSB- RR = @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	There was no evidence of increased risk of thromboembolic events in those patients allocated to TXA .
CONCLUSIONS	TXA may reduce PIH in patients with TBI ; however , the difference was not statistically significant in this trial .
CONCLUSIONS	Large clinical trials are needed to confirm and to assess the effect of TXA on death or disability after TBI .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to adapt a traditional recipe into a healthier form by adding @ g of oat - glucan , substituting milk chocolate to dark chocolate with @ % cocoa , and to examine the effect of these alterations on short-term satiety and energy intake .
METHODS	Study subjects ( n = @ ) were tested in a randomized , crossover design with four products closely matched for energy content .
METHODS	Four different versions of a traditional recipe including milk chocolate-control ( CON ) , oat - glucan ( B-GLU ) , dark chocolate ( DARK ) or oat - glucan and dark chocolate ( B-GLU + DARK ) were given to subjects on different test days .
METHODS	After subjects were asked to report visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores on sensory outcomes and related satiety for four hours ad libitum , lunch was served and energy intake of individuals was measured .
RESULTS	VAS scores indicated that none of the test foods exerted an improved effect on satiety feelings .
RESULTS	However , energy intake of individuals during ad libitum lunch was significantly lower in dark chocolate groups ( CON : @ @ kcal versus DARK : @ @ kcal and B-GLU + DARK : @ @ kcal , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The study demonstrated that substituting dark chocolate for milk chocolate is more effective in inducing satiety during subsequent food intake in healthy subjects .

BACKGROUND	In recent years , the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in the prevalence of pregnant opioid-dependent women and of neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) , which is caused by withdrawal from in-utero drug exposure .
BACKGROUND	While methadone-maintenance currently is the standard of care for opioid dependence during pregnancy , research suggests that buprenorphine-maintenance may be associated with shorter infant hospital lengths of stay ( LOS ) relative to methadone-maintenance .
BACKGROUND	There is no `` gold standard '' treatment for NAS but there is evidence that buprenorphine , relative to morphine or methadone , treatment may reduce LOS and length of treatment .
METHODS	Point-of-care clinical trial ( POCCT ) designs , maximizing external validity while reducing cost and complexity associated with classic randomized clinical trials , were selected for two planned trials to compare methadone to buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence during pregnancy and for NAS .
METHODS	This paper describes design considerations for the Medication-assisted treatment for Opioid-dependent expecting Mothers ( MOMs ; estimated N = @ ) and Investigation of Narcotics for Ameliorating Neonatal abstinence syndrome on Time in hospital ( INFANTs ; estimated N = @ ) POCCTs , both of which are randomized , intent-to-treat , two-group trials .
METHODS	Outcomes would be obtained from participants ' electronic health record at three participating hospitals .
METHODS	Additionally , a subset of infants in the INFANTs POCCT would be from mothers in the MOMs POCCT and , thus , potential interaction between medication treatment of mother and infant could be evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	This pair of planned POCCTs would evaluate the comparative effectiveness of treatments for opioid dependence during pregnancy and for NAS .
CONCLUSIONS	The results could have a significant impact on practice .

OBJECTIVE	Uptake of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccinations by @ - to @-year-old girls in England is below ( < @ % ) target ( @ % ) .
OBJECTIVE	This trial assesses ( a ) the impact of financial incentives on uptake and completion of an HPV vaccination program , and ( b ) whether impacts are moderated by participants ' deprivation level .
OBJECTIVE	It also assesses the impact of incentives on decision quality to get vaccinated , as measured by attitudes toward the vaccination and knowledge of its consequences .
METHODS	One thousand @ - to @-year-old girls were invited to participate in an HPV vaccination program : @ previously uninvited , and @ unresponsive to previous invitations .
METHODS	Girls randomly received either a standard invitation letter or a letter including the offer of vouchers worth @ ( @ ; $ @ ) for undergoing @ vaccinations .
METHODS	Girls attending their first vaccination appointment completed a questionnaire assessing decision quality to be vaccinated .
METHODS	Outcomes were uptake of the first and third vaccinations and decision quality .
RESULTS	The intervention increased uptake of the first ( first-time invitees : @ % vs. @ % , odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI ; @ , @ -RSB- ; previous nonattenders : @ % vs. @ % , OR = @ , @ % CI -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ) and third ( first-time invitees : @ % vs. @ % , OR = @ , @ % CI -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ; previous nonattenders : @ % vs. @ % , OR = @ , @ % CI -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ) vaccinations .
RESULTS	Impacts were not moderated by deprivation level .
RESULTS	Decision quality was unaffected by the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the intervention increased completion of HPV vaccinations , uptake remained lower than the national target , which , in addition to cost effectiveness and acceptability issues , necessitates consideration of other ways of achieving it .

OBJECTIVE	To test whether subconjunctival cyclosporine A ( CsA ) implants affect the incidence and the degree of corneal neovascularization occurring after penetrating keratoplasty .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized , multicenter , controlled phase @/@ clinical trial .
METHODS	The study comprised @ trial sites in Germany , India , and the United States .
METHODS	Enrolled patients ( n = @ ) were randomized to @ of @ groups : treatment group A ( n = @ ) , treatment group B ( n = @ ) , and the control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Patients from each group received either of @ doses of subconjunctival CsA ( group A , low-dose CsA ; group B , high-dose CsA ) or placebo ( carrier only ) implants at the time of high-risk penetrating keratoplasty .
METHODS	The incidence and degree of corneal neovascularization occurring after penetrating keratoplasty were evaluated in a substudy ( LX@-@ study : NCT@ ) .
METHODS	A web-based image upload system was developed .
METHODS	Standardized digital slit-lamp pictures were quantitatively and objectively evaluated using CellF morphometry software .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference in incidence and degree of corneal neovascularization developing after penetrating keratoplasty was found between treatment groups and placebo group .
RESULTS	Mean corneal neovascularization area at week @ ( visit @ ) was @ % in treatment group A versus placebo ( @ % ; P = @ ) and @ % in treatment group B versus placebo ( @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High-dose subconjunctival CsA implants do not significantly affect corneal neovascularization after high-risk penetrating keratoplasty .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that local CsA has negligible antiangiogenic effects in the human cornea , at least in the transplant setting .

BACKGROUND	Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) and metabolic alterations are among the majors public health concern that have been reported in people living with HIV infections .
BACKGROUND	Factors contributing to cardio metabolic syndrome in HIV include body fat distribution , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , cardiovascular dysfunction and inflammation .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the study was to determine the effect of Spirulina platensis ( Cyanobacteriaceae ) supplementation versus local diet on lipid profile in HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive patients .
METHODS	A prospective single-blind , randomized , multicentre study was conducted from February @ to December @ .
METHODS	A total of @ HIV antiretroviral-nave patients were screened and @ were recruited in this study .
METHODS	Patients were randomized and received either Spirulina supplementation combined with local diet ( n = @ ) or local diet only ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Age , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , lipid profile , CD@ count , and local food intake variables were assessed on three separate occasions ( three , six and twelve months ) .
RESULTS	An average age of the patients was @ years .
RESULTS	The majority of participants were female @ % .
RESULTS	Regarding the lipid profile , there is a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol and a significant decrease in total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in the group of patients who consumed Spirulina platensis .
RESULTS	A change in the atherogenic index defined by the ratio CT/HDL-C substitutable by LDL-C/HDL-C and the TC/HDL decreased significantly from @ at baseline to @ after @ months ( p = @ and p < @ ) in the patients taking Spirulina .
CONCLUSIONS	Nutritional supplementation with Spirulina combined with a quantitative and qualitative balanced diet for at least six months can retard an exposition to lipid abnormalities in HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are recommended on a large group of people not infected with HIV and exposed to cardiovascular risk factors .

BACKGROUND	In the Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction ( STREAM ) trial , a pharmaco-invasive ( PI ) strategy was compared with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients presenting within @ hours after symptom onset but unable to undergo pPCI within @ hour .
BACKGROUND	At @ days , the PI approach was associated with a nominally but nonstatistically significant lower incidence of the composite primary end point of death , shock , congestive heart failure , and reinfarction when compared with pPCI .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of these strategies on @-year mortality .
RESULTS	Vital status at @ year was available in @ of @ ( @ % ) and @ of @ ( @ % ) patients in the PI and pPCI arm , respectively .
RESULTS	At @ year , all-cause mortality rates ( @ % versus @ % ) were similar for PI and pPCI-treated patients ( P = @ ; risk ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Cardiac mortality rates were similar as well ( @ % versus @ % , P = @ ; risk ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall , only @ patients died between day @ and @ year , @ in the PI arm and @ in the pPCI arm , of whom @ died of noncardiac reasons ( @ in the PI and @ in the pPCI arm ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in @-year all-cause mortality between the @ groups among the prespecified key subgroups .
CONCLUSIONS	At @ year , mortality rates in the PI and pPCI arms were similar in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients presenting within @ hours after symptom onset and unable to undergo pPCI within @ hour .

OBJECTIVE	To use measurement by cycling power meters ( Pmes ) to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used models for estimating uphill cycling power ( Pest ) .
OBJECTIVE	Experiments were designed to explore the influence of wind speed and steepness of climb on accuracy of Pest .
OBJECTIVE	The authors hypothesized that the random error in Pest would be largely influenced by the windy conditions , the bias would be diminished in steeper climbs , and windy conditions would induce larger bias in Pest .
METHODS	Sixteen well-trained cyclists performed @ uphill-cycling trials ( range : length @-@ @ km , slope @-@ @ % ) in a random order .
METHODS	Trials included different riding position in a group ( lead or follow ) and different wind speeds .
METHODS	Pmes was quantified using a power meter , and Pest was calculated with a methodology used by journalists reporting on the Tour de France .
RESULTS	Overall , the difference between Pmes and Pest was -@ % ( @ % CI : -@ % , +@ % ) for all trials and @ % ( -@ % , +@ % ) in conditions without wind ( < @ m/s ) .
RESULTS	The relationship between percent slope and the error between Pest and Pmes were considered trivial .
CONCLUSIONS	Aerodynamic drag ( affected by wind velocity and orientation , frontal area , drafting , and speed ) is the most confounding factor .
CONCLUSIONS	The mean estimated values are close to the power-output values measured by power meters , but the random error is between @ % and @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , at the power outputs ( > @ W ) produced by professional riders , this error is likely to be higher .
CONCLUSIONS	This observation calls into question the validity of releasing individual values without reporting the range of random errors .

BACKGROUND	Communication and information in order to reduce anxiety in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) has been described as area needing improvement .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , the aim of this trial was to evaluate whether a structured information program that intensifies information given in standard care process reduces anxiety in ICU patients .
METHODS	Multicenter , two-armed , non-blinded , parallel-group randomized controlled trial in hospitals in the cities of Marburg , Halle , and Stuttgart ( Germany ) .
METHODS	The trial was performed in cardiac surgery , general surgery , and internal medicine ICUs .
METHODS	Two-hundred and eleven elective and non-elective ICU patients were enrolled in the study ( intervention group , n = @ ; control group , n = @ ) .
METHODS	The experimental intervention comprised a single episode of structured oral information that was given in addition to standard care and covered two main parts : ( @ ) A more standardized part about predefined ICU specific aspects - mainly procedural , sensory and coping information , and ( @ ) an individualized part about fears and questions of the patient .
METHODS	The control group received a non-specific episodic conversation of similar length additional to standard care .
METHODS	Both conversations took place at the beginning of the ICU stay and lasted @-@ minutes .
METHODS	Study nurses administered both interventions .
METHODS	The primary outcome ICU-related anxiety ( CINT-Score , @-@ pts. , higher scores indicate higher anxiety ) was assessed after admission to a regular ward .
RESULTS	The primary outcome could be measured in @ intervention group participants and @ control group participants resulting in mean values of @ ( SD @ ) compared to @ ( SD @ ) and a mean difference of -@ ( CI @ % -@ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A structured information intervention additional to standard care during ICU stay had no demonstrated additional benefit compared to an unspecific communication of similar duration .
CONCLUSIONS	Reduction of anxiety in ICU patients will probably require more continuous approaches to information giving and communication .

BACKGROUND	High blood pressure is associated with poor outcome after stroke .
BACKGROUND	Whether blood pressure should be lowered early after stroke , and whether to continue or temporarily withdraw existing antihypertensive drugs , is not known .
BACKGROUND	We assessed outcomes after stroke in patients given drugs to lower their blood pressure .
METHODS	In our multicentre , partial-factorial trial , we randomly assigned patients admitted to hospital with an acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke and raised systolic blood pressure ( systolic @-@ mm Hg ) to @ days of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate ( @ mg per day ) , started within @ h of stroke onset , or to no glyceryl trinitrate ( control group ) .
METHODS	A subset of patients who were taking antihypertensive drugs before their stroke were also randomly assigned to continue or stop taking these drugs .
METHODS	The primary outcome was function , assessed with the modified Rankin Scale at @ days by observers masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	This study is registered , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Between July @ , @ , and Oct @ , @ , we enrolled @ patients .
RESULTS	Mean blood pressure was @ ( SD @ ) mm Hg/@ ( @ ) mm Hg at baseline ( median @ h -LSB- @-@ -RSB- after stroke onset ) , and was significantly reduced on day @ in @ patients allocated to glyceryl trinitrate compared with @ controls ( difference -@ -LSB- @ % CI -@ to -@ -RSB- mm Hg / -@ -LSB- -@ to -@ -RSB- mm Hg ; both p < @ ) , and on day @ in @ patients allocated to continue antihypertensive drugs compared with @ patients randomised to stop them ( difference -@ -LSB- @ % CI -@ to -@ -RSB- mm Hg / -@ -LSB- -@ to -@ -RSB- mm Hg ; both p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Functional outcome at day @ did not differ in either treatment comparison-the adjusted common odds ratio ( OR ) for worse outcome with glyceryl trinitrate versus no glyceryl trinitrate was @ ( @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) , and with continue versus stop antihypertensive drugs OR was @ ( @-@ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with acute stroke and high blood pressure , transdermal glyceryl trinitrate lowered blood pressure and had acceptable safety but did not improve functional outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	We show no evidence to support continuing prestroke antihypertensive drugs in patients in the first few days after acute stroke .

OBJECTIVE	The mercury sphygmomanometer has been the gold standard used for obtaining blood pressure ( BP ) for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) from @ to the present .
OBJECTIVE	However , due to environmental concerns and an increased use of automated oscillometric BP devices , NHANES has been exploring an alternative to using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer ( mercury ) to measure BP .
METHODS	The accuracy of Omron HEM-@XL BP readings was compared with that of mercury BP device readings for gender , age group , race and ethnicity , and body mass index categories and cuff-size subgroups .
METHODS	Each person had three BP measurements per device recorded sequentially .
METHODS	The order of the devices and readers were randomly assigned .
METHODS	A total of @,@ participants had three valid systolic readings , and @,@ had three valid diastolic readings .
RESULTS	Omron and mercury measurements were correlated ( r = @ , systolic BP ; r = @ , diastolic BP ) .
RESULTS	Overall , the mean between-device differences ( Omron and mercury ) were -@ mm Hg for systolic and -@ mm Hg for diastolic ( p < @ for both ) .
RESULTS	The mean between-device differences were less than or about @ mm Hg for each subgroup : gender , age group , race and ethnicity , and body mass index categories , and cuff-size subgroups .
RESULTS	The exceptions were mean systolic between-device differences for those using the extra-large BP cuff ( -@ mm Hg ) and obese individuals ( -@ mm Hg ) , and the mean diastolic between-device differences for the underweight group ( -@ mm Hg ) .
RESULTS	Assuming mercury to be the gold standard , between-device agreements for the frequency of high BP ( @/@ mm Hg or more ) and stage II high BP ( @/@ mm Hg or more ) were above chance ( kappa = @ for both ) .
RESULTS	Omron underestimated the high BP frequency by @ % and stage II high BP frequency by @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Lower estimates of high BP by the Omron device may require adjusting future national prevalence estimates accordingly to account for between-device differences .

BACKGROUND	Challenging behaviors exhibited by individuals with dementia might result from an unmet need that they can not communicate directly due to cognitive restrictions .
BACKGROUND	A dementia-specific case conference represents a promising means of analyzing and exploring these unmet needs .
BACKGROUND	The ongoing FallDem study is a stepped-wedged , cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effects of two different types of dementia-specific case conferences on the challenging behaviors of nursing home residents .
BACKGROUND	This study protocol describes the process evaluation that is conducted , along with the FallDem study.The goal of the process evaluation is to explain potential discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes , and to provide insights into implementation processes and recruitment strategies , as well as the contexts and contextual factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of dementia-specific case conferences .
METHODS	The process evaluation will use a mixed-method design comprising longitudinal elements , in which quantitative and qualitative data will be gathered .
METHODS	Qualitative data will be analyzed using content analysis , documentary analysis and a documentary method .
METHODS	Quantitative data ( standardized questionnaires ) will be analyzed using descriptive statistics .
METHODS	Both types of data will complement one another and provide a more comprehensive picture of the different objects under investigation .
CONCLUSIONS	The process evaluation will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the changing processes and mechanisms underlying the ` black box ' of the complex intervention of the FallDem study .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings will provide practical knowledge regarding issues related to the implementation of dementia-specific case conferences in nursing homes .

OBJECTIVE	The Achilles tendon is a tissue that responds to mechanical loads at a molecular and cellular level .
OBJECTIVE	In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the expression of anabolic and/or catabolic proteins can change within hours of loading and return to baseline levels within @h .
OBJECTIVE	These biochemical changes have not been correlated with changes in whole tendon structure on imaging .
OBJECTIVE	We examined the nature and temporal sequence of changes in Achilles tendon structure in response to competitive game loads in elite Australian football players .
METHODS	Elite male Australian football players with no history of Achilles tendinopathy were recruited .
METHODS	Achilles tendon structure was quantified using ultrasound tissue characterisation ( UTC ) imaging , a valid and reliable measure of intratendinous structure , the day prior to the match ( day @ ) , and then reimaged on days @ , @ and @ postgame .
RESULTS	Of the @ participants eligible for this study , @ had no history of tendinopathy ( NORM ) and @ had a history of patellar or hamstring tendinopathy ( TEN ) .
RESULTS	Differences in baseline UTC echopattern were observed between the NORM and TEN groups , with the Achilles of the TEN group exhibiting altered UTC echopattern , consistent with a slightly disorganised tendon structure .
RESULTS	In the NORM group , a significant reduction in echo-type I ( normal tendon structure ) was seen on day @ ( p = @ ) that returned to baseline on day @ .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a transient change in UTC echopattern in the Achilles tendon as a result of an Australian football game in individuals without a history of lower limb tendinopathy .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial comparing two strategies -LSB- physician ( MD ) vs. non-physician ( non-MD ) -RSB- for approaching substitute decision makers ( SDMs ) for research and to evaluate SDMs ' experiences in being approached for consent .
METHODS	A pilot mixed methods study of first encounters with SDMs .
RESULTS	Of @ SDMs ( @ eligibility events ) , @ and @ were randomized to MD and non-MD introductions , respectively .
RESULTS	Eighty SDMs ( @ events ) provided consent and @ SDMs ( @ events ) declined consent for studies , including @ SDMs who provided and declined consent .
RESULTS	We identified few missed introductions -LSB- @/@ ( @ % ) -RSB- and protocol violations -LSB- @/@ ( @ % ) -RSB- , high comfort , satisfaction and acceptance scores and similar consent rates in both arms .
RESULTS	SDMs provided consent significantly more often when a patient update was provided in the MD arm .
RESULTS	Most SDMs ( @ % ) felt that physician involvement was inconsequential and preferred physician time to be dedicated to patient care ; however , SDM experiences were closely related to their recall of being approached and recall was poor .
RESULTS	SDMs highlighted @ themes of importance to them in research surrogate decision-making .
CONCLUSIONS	SDMs prioritized the personal attributes of the person approaching them over professional designation and preferred physician time to be dedicated to patient care .
CONCLUSIONS	A mixed methods design evaluated intervention fidelity and provided the rationale for not proceeding to a larger trial , despite achieving all feasibility metrics in the pilot trial .

BACKGROUND	Dilation-assisted stone extraction , also termed small endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) plus endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation , is more efficient than EST alone for removal of large common bile duct ( CBD ) stones .
BACKGROUND	However , whether this technique can be used for all stones is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and complications of dilation-assisted stone extraction for CBD stones .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with CBD stones were randomized to undergo either dilation-assisted stone extraction ( group A ) or EST ( group B ) .
METHODS	The efficacy and complications of the two techniques were compared .
RESULTS	Groups A and B showed similar outcomes in terms of stone removal .
RESULTS	The short-term and @-year complication rates were also similar between the two groups .
RESULTS	However , the first-session stone removal rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. Mechanical lithotripsy was required significantly more often in group B than in group A.
RESULTS	The total procedure time and total fluoroscopy time in group A were significantly shorter than those in group B.
CONCLUSIONS	Dilation-assisted stone extraction and EST are safe and effective techniques for the treatment of CBD stones .
CONCLUSIONS	Dilation-assisted stone extraction has high efficiency .
CONCLUSIONS	This technique is an alternative method for removal of CBD stones .

BACKGROUND	The @-amino acid ( AA ) signature , including isoleucine , leucine , valine , tyrosine , and phenylalanine , has been associated with incident diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance .
BACKGROUND	We investigated whether this same AA signature , single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes in their catabolic pathway , was associated with development of impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) after atenolol treatment .
RESULTS	Among @ European American participants enrolled in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses ( PEAR ) study and treated with atenolol for @ weeks , we prospectively followed a nested cohort that had both metabolomics profiling and genotype data available for the development of IFG .
RESULTS	We assessed the association between baseline circulating levels of isoleucine , leucine , valine , tyrosine , and phenylalanine , as well as single-nucleotide polymorphisms in branched-chain amino-acid transaminase @ ( BCAT@ ) and phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) with development of IFG .
RESULTS	All baseline AA levels were strongly associated with IFG development .
RESULTS	Each increment in standard deviation of the @ AAs was associated with the following odds ratio and @ % confidence interval for IFG based on a fully adjusted model : isoleucine @ ( @-@ @ ) , leucine @ ( @-@ @ ) , valine @ ( @-@ @ ) , tyrosine @ ( @-@ @ ) , and phenylalanine @ ( @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The composite P value was @ ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	Those with PAH ( rs@ ) AA genotype had the highest incidence of IFG ( P for trend = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data provide important insight into the metabolic and genetic mechanisms underlying atenolol-associated adverse metabolic effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Trial Registration - http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier : NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Tobacco use is still the leading preventable cause of death and morbidity in the U.S. Web-assisted tobacco interventions are an effective but underutilized tool in assisting smokers with quitting .
BACKGROUND	The dental visit is an excellent opportunity to assist smokers in quitting by referring them to these tobacco-cessation online programs .
OBJECTIVE	The study purpose was to test two patient referral methods-paper referrals ( information prescriptions ) versus paper plus e-referrals-to a web-assisted smoking-cessation induction system .
METHODS	RCT that used implementation research methods .
METHODS	A total of @ community-based dental practices were enrolled and @ smokers were referred to the web-assisted tobacco induction system .
METHODS	The study intervention was a proactive e-referral of smokers to a web-assisted tobacco induction system called Decide@Quit.org , and the control group used paper referrals ( information prescriptions ) to refer smokers to the Decide@Quit.org .
METHODS	The outcome measurements were the referral numbers , Decide@Quit registration numbers , and the smokers ' quit rate .
METHODS	Data were collected in @-@ and analyses were completed in @ .
RESULTS	Although total referrals from intervention practices was lower than control , subsequent proportions of registrations among smokers referred to Decide@Quit.org were nearly fourfold higher ( adjusted mean percentages : @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) in intervention compared with control practices .
RESULTS	Subsequent rates of cessation among referred smokers were threefold higher ( adjusted mean percentages : @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) in intervention practices as compared with control .
CONCLUSIONS	Intervention practices using the e-referral system had higher smoker registration numbers and higher quit smoking rates than the control practices .
CONCLUSIONS	This study finds that e-referrals are effective in getting smokers to the web-assisted smoking-cessation induction system and in assisting with quitting that more than compensates for any additional effort that e-referrals require on the part of the practitioner .

OBJECTIVE	The plasticity of bone marrow stem cells has been confirmed to self-renew and transdifferentiate into hepatocytes .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , we performed autologous stem cell transplantation for rapid liver regeneration with extensive hepatectomy in hepatocellular cancer patients .
METHODS	With informed consent , patients aged @ to @ who needed large extensive hepatectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly divided into three groups : control , mononuclear cells ( MNCs ) , and CD@ + cells , based on infused cell type .
METHODS	After portal vein embolization ( PVE ) , mobilized MNCs or CD@ + cells were returned to the patient via the portal vein on mobilization day without manipulation .
METHODS	Liver volume , liver function , clinical score and Indocyanine green R@ ( ICG-R@ ) were compared before and after PVE .
RESULTS	Total bilirubin , albumin , and clinical score showed significant improvement ( p < @ ) @ week post-infusion , with no significant difference between MNC and CD@ + cell groups .
RESULTS	Four patients ( control , @ ; MNC , @ ; CD@ + , @ ) started at over @ % ICG-R@ but can be overturned after PVE .
RESULTS	Daily hepatic volume growth ( mL/day ) was @ for MNC and @ for CD@ + groups , resulting in significant increase over controls ( @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	We found no correlation between the number of applied CD@ + cells and daily gains in left lateral lobe volume .
CONCLUSIONS	Improvements in liver volume , liver function , clinical score and ICG-R@ suggest that autologous stem cell transplantation is a promising method for liver regeneration .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the agreement between body composition measurements made with two methods-single-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis ( SF-BIA ) and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy ( BIS ) .
METHODS	The body composition measurements using SF-BIA and BIS were performed seven times during @ months on @ patients ( @ men and @ women ) with metabolic syndrome who were taking part in a dietary intervention study .
RESULTS	The mean -LSB- standard deviation ( SD ) -RSB- fat mass ( FM ) and median -LSB- interquartile range ( IQR ) -RSB- FM % measured with SF-BIA were @ ( @ ) kg and @ ( @-@ @ ) % , respectively , compared with @ ( @ ) kg and @ ( @-@ @ ) % , respectively , using BIS .
RESULTS	The median ( IQR ) fat-free mass ( FFM ) was @ ( @-@ @ ) kg according to SF-BIA and @ ( @-@ @ ) kg according to BIS .
RESULTS	These results obtained with the two methods were significantly different ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Still highly significant correlations were found between the results obtained with SF-BIA and BIS for FM and FFM ( all r@ @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Using Bland-Altman analysis , the bias was found to be -@ ( @ ) kg for FM , -@ ( @ ) % for FM % , and @ ( @ ) kg for FFM .
RESULTS	Rather wide limits of agreement were found for FM , FM % , and FFM .
CONCLUSIONS	Body composition data obtained using SF-BIA and BIS in subjects with metabolic syndrome were highly correlated but not interchangeable .
CONCLUSIONS	FM was systematically lower when using SF-BIA than when using BIS .

BACKGROUND	Generics have the potential to contain drug therapy costs ; successful implementation of generic substitution policy largely depends on consumers ' willingness to choose generics .
OBJECTIVE	This study aims to analyse the opinions , experiences and preferences of Polish patients towards generic medicines .
METHODS	The study was performed in Poland .
METHODS	The survey was conducted in June @ by means of face-to-face interviews .
METHODS	Respondents were drawn from the general population according to a population structure .
METHODS	The study covered a representative sample of @,@ Poles ; the results can be generalized to apply to the Polish population at large .
RESULTS	Fifty-two percent of respondents declared to be more often choosing generics , twenty-three percent did not have any specific preferences , and twenty-five percent were more willing to choose brand-name medicines .
RESULTS	Past experience with cheaper generic medicines , secondary or lower education , low income and residence in specific regions of Poland were all significantly associated with an increased willingness to choose generics .
RESULTS	Respondents ' attitudes towards generics were mostly influenced by the opinions of doctors and pharmacists .
RESULTS	According to respondents , attitudes towards generics among doctors , pharmacists , family and friends , and in the mass media were mostly positive .
RESULTS	There was no relationship between the preference of respondents for generics and factors such as their age , life stage , gender , household size or urban/rural locality .
RESULTS	As a result of substituting a brand-name drug with its generic equivalent , @ % of respondents reported that they had not noticed any difference in drug effectiveness ; @ % had experienced a reduced effectiveness of treatment or increased side effects at least once ; and @ % claimed the generic worked better .
RESULTS	The majority of respondents who used cheaper substitutes claimed that generics represented good or very good quality .
CONCLUSIONS	The study demonstrates that , when choosing medicines , Poles rely mainly on the opinions of their doctors and pharmacists .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , it is recommended that : ( @ ) the option of using generics be promoted when writing prescriptions , and ( @ ) the obligation on pharmacists to inform customers of their option to purchase generics be enforced .

OBJECTIVE	Insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway ( NPA ) during endoscopic sedation is only recommended in the event of respiratory problems .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine insertion of an NPA during sedation in gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy .
METHODS	Between July @ and April @ , patients with colonoscopy or expected longer-lasting or therapeutic upper GI endoscopy were pseudo-randomized in a weekly alternating fashion to perform sedation ( midazolam in combination with propofol ) with or without NPA insertion .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was respiratory depression ( oxygen saturation < @ % ) .
METHODS	Secondary measures included hypotension ( systolic blood pressure < @ mm Hg ) , bradycardia ( heart rate < @ beats/min ) or nasopharyngeal damage after NPA insertion .
RESULTS	@ ( @ females , mean age @ @ years ) were enrolled .
RESULTS	Colonoscopy was performed in @ patients and upper endoscopy in @ patients .
RESULTS	In @ patients an NPA was used ( intervention group ) .
RESULTS	Five ( @ % ) of those patients showed minor nasopharyngeal injury .
RESULTS	Respiratory depression ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) and hypotension ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) occurred more frequently in the control than in the intervention group .
CONCLUSIONS	The routine placement of an NPA can reduce the frequency of hypoxemic events during endoscopic sedation with minor risks for nasopharyngeal injury .

BACKGROUND	Chronic hypoxia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , but its association with blood pressure ( BP ) remains unclear .
BACKGROUND	We performed this study to clarify the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia is associated with abnormal BP variability in patients with pneumoconiosis .
METHODS	We recruited @ patients with pneumoconiosis and @ age - and BP level-matched control subjects .
METHODS	We used simultaneous pulse oximetry and ambulatory BP monitoring for all subjects .
METHODS	We evaluated their BP levels and variability by determining the SD and coefficient of variation ( CV ) of the BP data .
METHODS	The dipper pattern was defined as nocturnal BP fall @ % ; the nondipper pattern was defined as nocturnal BP fall @ % but < @ % ; the riser pattern was defined as nocturnal BP fall < @ % .
METHODS	Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to calculate the correlations between parameters .
RESULTS	In patients with pneumoconiosis , the daytime systolic BP ( SBP ) level was lower , the CV in @-hour SBP ( P < @ ) and diastolic BP ( P < @ ) were higher than that in control subjects .
RESULTS	And although not statistically significant ( P = @ ) , the odds ratio of riser pattern was @ in patients with pneumoconiosis , and their nighttime pulse rate was significantly higher ( P < @ ) than that in control subjects .
RESULTS	The median daytime pulse oximetry oxygen saturation was inversely associated with mean ( r = -@ ; P < @ ) and SD ( r = -@ ; P < @ ) in daytime SBP .
RESULTS	The median nighttime pulse oximetry oxygen saturation was inversely associated ( r = -@ ; P < @ ) and the mean nighttime pulse rate was associated ( r = @ ; P < @ ) with CV in nighttime SBP .
RESULTS	Partial pressure of oxygen was inversely associated with CV in daytime SBP ( r = -@ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Exaggerated BP variability was seen in patients with pneumoconiosis , and the measures of hypoxia were associated with large fluctuations in ambulatory BP .
CONCLUSIONS	Chronic and intermittent hypoxia could be the contributing factors of these findings .

OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which sample length affected the reliability of total number of words ( TNW ) , number of different words ( NDW ) , and mean length of C-units in morphemes ( MLCUm ) in parent-elicited conversational samples for @-year-olds .
METHODS	Participants were sixty @-year-olds .
METHODS	A @-min language sample was collected from each child during free play with the parent in the laboratory .
METHODS	Samples of @ , @ , @ , and @ min were extracted from the @-min samples .
METHODS	TNW , NDW , and MLCUm were computed from each shorter sample and the @-min sample .
METHODS	TNW and NDW were adjusted by number of minutes for comparisons .
METHODS	The differences and correlations between each shorter sample cut and the @-min sample on MLCUm and adjusted TNW and NDW were computed .
RESULTS	The shorter samples and the @-min samples significantly differed in adjusted TNW and NDW , but not in MLCUm .
RESULTS	TNW reached an acceptable reliability level ( i.e. , r = @ ) in @-min samples .
RESULTS	NDW and MLCUm approached the acceptable reliability level ( rs = @ ) in @-min samples and reached it in @-min samples .
CONCLUSIONS	For conversational language samples with similar collection procedures , samples of @ to @ min are desirable for calculating TNW , NDW , and MLCUm in @-year-olds .

OBJECTIVE	Off-midline procedures seem to be the best method of primary wound closure after excision of a pilonidal sinus .
OBJECTIVE	Primary wound closure with a Limberg flap was compared to secondary wound healing .
METHODS	From January @ to July @ , @ patients with given informed consent ( mean age @ years , men @ % ) who had excision of a pilonidal sinus in three hospitals in Switzerland were randomised to group L ( Limberg flap , n = @ ) or to group E ( excision only , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was duration of incapacity for work .
METHODS	Follow-up was at @ weeks and at @ year postoperative ( @ % follow-up ) .
RESULTS	Both groups were comparable with regard to patient characteristics .
RESULTS	The median ( range ) operation time was @ ( @-@ ) min in group L vs. @ ( @-@ ) min in group E ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found in postoperative pain and painkiller intake ; pain , percentage of patients at work and overall satisfaction at @ weeks postoperative ; and overall duration of incapacity for work and overall satisfaction at @-year follow-up .
RESULTS	The complication rate was @ % in group L vs. @ % in group E ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Complications in group L were seroma ( @ % ) , wound dehiscence ( @ % ) , skin necrosis ( @ % ) , hematoma ( @ % ) , infection ( @ % ) and recurrent disease ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Complications in group E were recurrent disease ( @ % ) and wound healing disorder ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After excision of a pilonidal sinus , primary wound closure with a Limberg flap has no advantage over secondary wound healing .
CONCLUSIONS	The main reason for this conclusion is the relatively high complication rate of primary wound closure with a Limberg flap .

OBJECTIVE	To observe capillary blood flow at acupoints during acupuncture treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and gain new insights into its analgesic mechanism .
METHODS	Patients with primary dysmenorrhea were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment or control group .
METHODS	Subjects ' symptoms were differentiated into various Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) syndromes and treated for @ sessions with puncturing acupuncture or self-pressing right-hand Hegu ( LI @ ) , adding other acupoints based on syndrome .
METHODS	Laser speckle was used to compare the change in the vasomotor amplitude and perfusion of the capillaries in Hegu ( LI @ ) before and during the treatment .
METHODS	Each subject was required to finish the period pain symptoms observation form , verbal rating scales , numerical rating scale , pain rating index , face rating scale , Zung self-rating depression scale , Zung self-rating anxiety scale , and numerical rating scale before and after treatments .
RESULTS	After @ sessions , the symptom scores , pain index ( PI ) , and visual analog scale ( VAS ) decreased significantly in treatment group .
RESULTS	The volume of blood flow in Hegu ( LI @ ) declined slightly .
RESULTS	No significant evidence supported that needling caused capillary contraction , but the capillary vasomotor amplitude at Hegu ( LI @ ) increased remarkably .
CONCLUSIONS	Acupuncture can increase the capillary blood flow , thus promoting the flow of Qi and blood in terms ofTCM theory , which facilitates pain relief .

BACKGROUND	Caring for a family member with dementia is extremely stressful , and contributes to psychiatric and physical illness among caregivers .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , a comprehensive programme called Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer 's Caregiver Health II ( REACH II ) was developed in the United States to enhance the health of Alzheimer 's caregivers .
BACKGROUND	REACH II causes a clear reduction of the stress and burdens faced by informal caregivers at home .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this protocol is to adapt , apply , and evaluate this proven intervention programme in a German-speaking area for the first time .
BACKGROUND	This newly adapted intervention is called Deutsche Adaption der Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer 's Caregiver Health ( DeREACH ) .
METHODS	A total of @ informal caregivers at home are recruited in a single-centred , randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	The intervention ( DeREACH ) consists of nine home visits and three telephone contacts over six months , all of which focus on safety , psychological well-being and self-care , social support , problem behaviour and preventive health-related behaviours .
METHODS	A complex intervention assessment on effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome - namely , the reduction of caregiver burden - and other secondary outcomes , including changes with regard to anxiety and depression , somatisation , health-related quality of life , and perceived social support , are measured at baseline , as well as immediately and three months after the intervention .
METHODS	The change from baseline to post-intervention assessment with regard to the primary outcome will be compared between treatment and control group using t-tests for independent samples .
CONCLUSIONS	It is anticipated that this study will show that DeREACH effectively reduces caregiver burden and therefore works under the conditions of a local German health-care system .
CONCLUSIONS	If successful , this programme will provide an effective intervention programme in the German-speaking area to identify and develop the personal capabilities of informal caregivers to cope with the burdens of caring for people with dementia .

BACKGROUND	Episodes of patient deterioration on hospital units are expected to increasingly contribute to morbidity and healthcare costs .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if real-time alerts sent to the rapid response team ( RRT ) improved patient care .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled trial .
METHODS	Eight medicine units ( Barnes-Jewish Hospital ) .
METHODS	Five hundred seventy-one patients .
METHODS	Real-time alerts generated by a validated deterioration algorithm were sent real-time to the RRT ( intervention ) or hidden ( control ) .
METHODS	Intensive care unit ( ICU ) transfer , hospital mortality , hospital duration .
RESULTS	ICU transfer ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ ) and hospital mortality ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) were similar for the intervention and control groups .
RESULTS	The number of patients requiring transfer to a nursing home or long-term acute care hospital was similar for patients in the intervention and control groups ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Hospital duration ( @ days vs @ days ; P = @ ) was statistically shorter for the intervention group .
RESULTS	The number of RRT calls initiated by the primary care team was similar for the intervention and control groups ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Real-time alerts sent to the RRT did not reduce ICU transfers , hospital mortality , or the need for subsequent long term care .
CONCLUSIONS	However , hospital length of stay was modestly reduced .

BACKGROUND	Insufficient fasting prior to endoscopic procedures performed under sedation may result in potential aspiration of gastric contents .
BACKGROUND	Fasting as per ASA guidelines is recommended prior to these procedures .
BACKGROUND	However , the effect of chewing gum on fasting status has been a subject of debate and often leads to procedural delays .
OBJECTIVE	Evaluation of the effect of chewing gum on the gastric volume and pH.
METHODS	In this randomized controlled prospective observer blinded trail , ASA I-III patients aged more than @ years scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) or a combined EGD and colonoscopy under conscious sedation were studied .
METHODS	Patients randomized to the chewing gum group ( Group-C ) were allowed to chew gum until just before the start of their procedure ; the remaining patients were included into Group-NC .
METHODS	After sedation and endoscope insertion , stomach contents were aspirated under vision of a gastroenterologist ( blinded to groups ) .
RESULTS	Volume and pH of gastric contents aspirated from @ patients ( @ in Group-C and @ in Group-NC ) were analyzed .
RESULTS	The demographic parameters of the groups were comparable .
RESULTS	Gastric volume ( median-interquartile range ) was statistically higher in Group-C ( @ ml ( @-@ @ ) vs Group-NC @ ml ( @-@ @ ) ( P < @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	The mean pH in both groups was comparable : @ @ in Group-C and @ @ in Group-NC ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although our results show gastric volume in patients chewing gum was statistically higher , clinical relevance of such a small difference is questionable .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus patients who chewed gum inadvertently prior to procedure should not be denied or delayed administration of sedative and anesthetic medications .

BACKGROUND	Sickness absence due to poor mental health is a common problem in many Western countries .
BACKGROUND	To facilitate return to work , it may be important to identify individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder and subsequently to offer appropriate treatment .
BACKGROUND	Psychoeducation alone has not previously been used as a return to work intervention , but may be a promising tool to facilitate return to work .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoeducation designed specifically to facilitate return to work for individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder .
BACKGROUND	The psychoeducation was a supplement to the various standard offers provided by the job centres .
METHODS	The study is a randomised controlled trial , in which individuals on sick leave either receive psychoeducation and standard case management or standard case management alone .
METHODS	Participants were individuals with mental health symptoms , who had been on sick leave from part-time or full-time work or unemployment for about @-@ weeks .
METHODS	The psychoeducational intervention was group-based and the course consisted of @ hour sessions once a week for @ weeks .
METHODS	The course was given by psychiatric nurses , a psychologist , a social worker , a physiotherapist and a person who had previously been on sick leave due to mental health problems .
METHODS	The sessions focused on stress and work life , and the purpose was to provide individuals on sick leave the skills to understand and improve their mental functioning.The primary outcome is the duration of sickness absence measured by register data .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms , mental health-related quality of life , and locus of control .
METHODS	These outcomes are measured by questionnaires at the start of the intervention and at @ and @ months follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	On the basis of this trial , the effect of psychoeducation for individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder will be studied .
CONCLUSIONS	The results will contribute to the continuing research on sickness absence and mental health .
CONCLUSIONS	It will primarily show whether psychoeducation can lead to faster and sustainable return to work .

OBJECTIVE	Modulation of immunologic interactions in cancer tissue is a promising therapeutic strategy .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the immunogenicity of human epidermal growth factor receptor @ ( HER@ ) - positive and triple-negative ( TN ) breast cancers ( BCs ) , we evaluated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) and immunologically relevant genes in the neoadjuvant GeparSixto trial .
METHODS	GeparSixto investigated the effect of adding carboplatin ( Cb ) to an anthracycline-plus-taxane combination ( PM ) on pathologic complete response ( pCR ) .
METHODS	A total of @ tumors were evaluated before random assignment for stromal TILs and lymphocyte-predominant BC ( LPBC ) .
METHODS	mRNA expression of immune-activating ( CXCL@ , CCL@ , CD@A , CD@ , CXCL@ , IGKC , CD@ ) as well as immunosuppressive factors ( IDO@ , PD-@ , PD-L@ , CTLA@ , FOXP@ ) was measured in @ tumors .
RESULTS	Increased levels of stromal TILs predicted pCR in univariable ( P < @ ) and multivariable analyses ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	pCR rate was @ % in LPBC and @ % for non-LPBC ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	pCR rates @ % were observed in patients with LPBC tumors treated with PMCb , with a significant test for interaction with therapy in the complete ( P = @ ) and HER@-positive ( P = @ ) , but not the TNBC , cohorts .
RESULTS	Hierarchic clustering of mRNA markers revealed three immune subtypes with different pCR rates ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	All @ immune mRNA markers were predictive for increased pCR .
RESULTS	The highest odds ratios ( ORs ) were observed for PD-L@ ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) and CCL@ ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Immunologic factors were highly significant predictors of therapy response in the GeparSixto trial , particularly in patients treated with Cb .
CONCLUSIONS	After further standardization , they could be included in histopathologic assessment of BC .

BACKGROUND	Randomized studies of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine suggest a survival benefit after resection of pancreatic cancer .
BACKGROUND	S-@ has also been shown to prolong survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer .
BACKGROUND	This study compared the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-@ or gemcitabine after resection of pancreatic cancer in a randomized trial .
METHODS	Patients who had undergone resection of pancreatic cancer were registered in this randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was disease-free survival ( DFS ) .
METHODS	Expression levels of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) mRNAs in cancer tissues were measured as indicators of fluoropyrimidine sensitivity .
RESULTS	Of @ patients registered , @ were allocated to the S-@ group and @ to gemcitabine .
RESULTS	DFS tended to be better with S-@ ( median @ ( @ per cent c.i. @ to @ ) months versus @ ( @ to @ ) months in the gemcitabine group ; P = @ ) , with a similar pattern for overall survival : @ ( @ per cent c.i. @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) months respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	When patients were divided into subgroups based on high or low DPD and TS expression , those with a DPD level below the median of @ or a TS level of at least @ had a significant prolongation of DFS after S-@ treatment compared with gemcitabine ( P = @ and P = @ respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , S-@ did not improve DFS compared with gemcitabine after pancreatic cancer resection , but there seemed to be a DFS advantage in patients with low expression of DPD or high expression of TS .

BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous doripenem ( DRPM ) in patients with biliary tract infection requiring biliary drainage in comparison with imipenem/cilastatin ( IPM/CS ) .
METHODS	After the initial collection of bile , patients were randomly assigned by the registration system of the Clinical Research Organization to receive intravenous drip infusion of DRPM @ g or IPM/CS @ g three times daily in a randomized , open-label manner .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were enrolled in the trial ( DRPM @ , IPM/CS @ ) .
RESULTS	The characteristics of the @ patients evaluated for efficacy were well balanced , except for the percentage of patients previously receiving antimicrobials , which was higher in the DRPM group than in the IPM/CS group .
RESULTS	The clinical response rate was not significantly different between the DRPM group ( @ % , @/@ patients ) and the IPM/CS group ( @ % , @/@ ) .
RESULTS	Non-inferiority assessment using confidence intervals demonstrated the non-inferiority of DRPM-IPM/CS .
RESULTS	The incidence of adverse events , for which a causal relationship with either treatment was not ruled out , was @ % ( @/@ ) in the DRPM group and @ % ( @/@ ) in the IPM/CS group , and none was serious .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinical efficacy of DRPM in treating moderate or severe biliary tract infection requiring drainage was comparable to that of IPM/CS .
CONCLUSIONS	DRPM was associated with no serious adverse events and a low incidence of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this trial demonstrate that DRPM is a useful therapeutic option for moderate or severe biliary tract infection .

OBJECTIVE	Our randomized trial compared early and delayed intrauterine device ( IUD ) insertion following medical abortion .
OBJECTIVE	In this planned substudy , we explore if endometrial thickness and initial IUD position were associated with IUD expulsion .
OBJECTIVE	We also describe IUD movement within the uterus during the @ months after insertion .
METHODS	We recruited women undergoing medical abortion and choosing the copper IUD for contraception ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to early insertion @ week after mifepristone or delayed insertion @-@ weeks later .
METHODS	We measured endometrial thickness by transvaginal sonogram @ week after abortion and IUD distance from the fundal aspect of the endometrial cavity three times : at insertion , @-@ weeks later and at @ months .
RESULTS	We analyzed endometrial thickness in @ women , baseline IUD position in @ women and IUD movement in @ women .
RESULTS	Women who expelled IUDs ( n = @ ) had slightly thicker endometria ( p = @ ) and slightly lower baseline IUD positions ( p = @ ) than those who retained IUDs , but no clear cutoffs emerged in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis .
RESULTS	Retained IUDs commonly moved up and down throughout the @ months ( from @ mm towards the fundus to @ mm towards the cervix ) .
RESULTS	Overall , retained IUDs moved a median of @mm towards the cervix between insertion and exit ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After medical abortion , the risk of IUD expulsion increases with thicker endometria and lower baseline position .
CONCLUSIONS	Since no clear cutoffs emerged in the analysis and expulsion remained uncommon even with thicker endometria , we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data .
CONCLUSIONS	Copper T IUDs often move within the uterus without expelling .
CONCLUSIONS	Expulsion is uncommon , and we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies observed the surprising finding that saturated fat was inversely associated with atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women , whereas polyunsaturated fat ( PUFA ) and carbohydrates were positively associated .
BACKGROUND	Whether certain genes modify the association of diet with atherosclerotic progression is unknown .
METHODS	Using Haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms , we evaluated gene-diet interactions with @ preselected genes involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism : sterol regulatory element binding protein-@ ( SREBP@ ) , insulin-induced gene-@ ( INSIG@ ) , and SREBP cleavage-activating protein ( SCAP ) .
METHODS	Diet was assessed at baseline .
METHODS	Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and after a mean of follow-up of @ years in @,@ coronary segments in @ postmenopausal women .
RESULTS	Global effects of each gene and gene-diet interactions for different fats , total fat , and carbohydrate were evaluated .
RESULTS	Global tests revealed no main effects between SCAP , INSIG@ , and SREBP@ haplotypes and progression of atherosclerosis ( P = @ , P = @ , and P = @ ) .
RESULTS	After correction for @ nutrients evaluated ( Bonferroni-corrected @-tailed = @ ) , no significant gene-nutrient interactions were seen , except for a borderline global interaction between SREBP@ and PUFA intake ( P interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	This interaction was specific to the G-C haplotype ( frequency @ % ) and was driven by n-@ rather than n-@ PUFA ( P for interaction < @ ) .
RESULTS	The interaction was robust to estimated isocaloric replacement of PUFA with any other nutrient .
RESULTS	Per each @ % energy from n-@ PUFA , a @-mm greater decline in mean minimal coronary artery diameter was seen among women per each copy of the second most frequent haplotype of SREBP@ .
CONCLUSIONS	We observed an interaction between SREBP@ and PUFA consumption that might explain the positive association of PUFA with atherosclerosis progression in this cohort .

OBJECTIVE	In spite of the major focus on risky , single-occasion drinking by young people in Australia , little is known about the specific circumstances of risky drinking occasions .
OBJECTIVE	This study examines drinking behaviours and drinking contexts for the most recent risky , single-occasion drinking episode in a representative sample of young risky drinkers in Victoria , Australia .
METHODS	A representative sample of @ young risky drinkers was recruited across metropolitan Melbourne and surveyed about their drinking and related behaviours .
METHODS	Specific questions focused on participants ' most recent high-risk ( > @ Australian standard drinks for males , > @ Australian standard drinks for females ) drinking occasion in terms of self-reported amount drunk , alcohol expenditure ( including buying rounds ) and drinking partners for up to @ different drinking settings .
RESULTS	Participants reported drinking a mean of @ Australian standard drinks on their last episode of risky , single-occasion drinking ; for half of the participants , this occurred less than @ days prior to being surveyed .
RESULTS	The majority ( @ % ) of risky single occasion drinking sessions commenced at private homes in the company of close friends ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Around @ % of the sample reported going to one ( @ % ) or two ( @ % ) drinking locations , and only @ % reported going to more than three drinking locations .
CONCLUSIONS	Contrary to public portrayals , a significant amount of risky drinking by young people occurs in private settings .
CONCLUSIONS	These contexts are rarely mentioned except in relation to underage drinking .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is needed to understand how these drinking behaviours and contexts link to harm .

OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate the influence of perioperative goal-directed fluid therapy ( GDFT ) on the prognosis of elderly patients with gastric cancer and hypertension .
METHODS	Sixty elderly patients ( > @ years old ) with primary hypertension who received gastric cancer radical surgery and who were American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) class II or III were enrolled in the current study .
METHODS	Selected patients were divided randomly into two arms , comprising a conventional intraoperative fluid management arm ( arm C , n = @ ) and a GDFT arm ( arm G , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Patients in arm C were infused with crystalloids or colloids according to the methods of Miller 's Anesthesia ( @th edition ) , while those in arm G were infused with @ mL hydroxyethyl starch over @ minutes under the FloTrac/Vigileo monitoring system , with stroke volume variation between @ % and @ % .
METHODS	Hemodynamics and tissue perfusion laboratory indicators in patients were recorded continuously from @ minutes before the operation to @ hours after the operation .
RESULTS	Compared with arm C , the average intraoperative intravenous infusion quantity in arm G was significantly reduced ( @,@ mL versus @,@ mL , P < @ ) , whereas average colloid fluid volume was significantly increased ( @,@ mL versus @ mL , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , there were more patients exhibiting intraoperatively and postoperatively stable hemodynamics and less patients with low blood pressure in arm G. Postoperative complications were less frequent , and the time of postoperative hospital stay shorter , in arm G. No significant differences were observed in mortality between the two arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Our research showed that GDFT stabilized perioperative hemodynamics and reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications in elderly patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery .

BACKGROUND	Health assessment and medical surveillance of workers exposed to combustion nanoparticles are challenging .
BACKGROUND	The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of using exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) from healthy volunteers for ( @ ) assessing the lung deposited dose of combustion nanoparticles and ( @ ) determining the resulting oxidative stress by measuring hydrogen peroxide ( H ( @ ) O ( @ ) ) and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) .
METHODS	Fifteen healthy nonsmoker volunteers were exposed to three different levels of sidestream cigarette smoke under controlled conditions .
METHODS	EBC was repeatedly collected before , during , and @ and @hr after exposure .
METHODS	Exposure variables were measured by direct reading instruments and by active sampling .
METHODS	The different EBC samples were analyzed for particle number concentration ( light-scattering-based method ) and for selected compounds considered oxidative stress markers .
RESULTS	Subjects were exposed to an average airborne concentration up to @ ( @ ) particles/cm ( @ ) ( average geometric size @-@nm ) .
RESULTS	Up to @ ( @ ) particles/mL could be measured in the collected EBC with a broad size distribution ( @ ( th ) percentile @nm ) , but these biological concentrations were not related to the exposure level of cigarette smoke particles .
RESULTS	Although H ( @ ) O ( @ ) and MDA concentrations in EBC increased during exposure , only H@O@ showed a transient normalization @hr after exposure and increased afterward .
RESULTS	In contrast , MDA levels stayed elevated during the @hr post exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of diffusion light scattering for particle counting proved to be sufficiently sensitive to detect objects in EBC , but lacked the specificity for carbonaceous tobacco smoke particles .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest two phases of oxidation markers in EBC : first , the initial deposition of particles and gases in the lung lining liquid , and later the start of oxidative stress with associated cell membrane damage .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should extend the follow-up time and should remove gases or particles from the air to allow differentiation between the different sources of H ( @ ) O ( @ ) and MDA .

OBJECTIVE	Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patients often present with ( pre ) diabetes , which negatively influences prognosis .
OBJECTIVE	Unlike the proven effect of exercise on glucose regulation in the general population , its effect in CHF is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , this study aimed at investigating the effect of exercise training on glucose regulation in stable CHF patients .
METHODS	Twenty-two CHF patients were randomized into training ( EX , n = @ ) and control ( CON , n = @ ) groups .
METHODS	Before and after a @-week training intervention involving endurance and resistance training , glucose tolerance ( @-hour oral glucose tolerance test ) , exercise tolerance ( cardiopulmonary exercise test ) , muscle strength ( isokinetic dynamometer ) , heart function ( echocardiography ) , glycated hemoglobin , body composition ( dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , and quality of life ( EQ@D ) were assessed .
RESULTS	At baseline , glucose levels @ hours after glucose intake were elevated in both groups .
RESULTS	Whereas area under the glucose curve did not change , area under the insulin curve decreased following training ( EX , -@ @ % vs CON , +@ @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Changes in the ratio of mitral peak velocity of early filling/early diastolic mitral annular velocity and waist-to-hip fat mass ratio were related to changes in the insulin curve .
RESULTS	Exercise training resulted in improved oxygen uptake at the second ventilatory threshold ( EX , +@ @ % vs CON , -@ @ % ; P < @ ) and isokinetic strength endurance of the upper leg ( EX , +@ @ % vs CON , -@ @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Lean body tissue was increased by @ @ % in EX versus @ @ % in CON ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest that exercise training attenuates worsening of glucose regulation typically seen in a stable CHF population .

OBJECTIVE	Low systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) is associated with poor outcomes in heart failure and complicates management .
OBJECTIVE	In a post hoc analysis , we investigated the efficacy and safety of ivabradine in the SHIFT population divided by tertiles of baseline SBP .
RESULTS	The analysis comprised @ patients with SBP < @ mmHg , @ with @ SBP < @ mmHg , and @ with SBP @ mmHg .
RESULTS	Patients with low SBP were younger , had lower ejection fraction , and were less likely to be at target beta-blocker dose than patients in the other SBP groups .
RESULTS	Ivabradine was associated with a similar relative risk reduction of the composite outcome in the three SBP groups -LSB- SBP < @ mmHg , hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ ; @ SBP < @ mmHg , HR = @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; SBP @ mmHg , HR = @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; P interaction = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Similar results were found for cardiovascular mortality ( P interaction = @ ) , hospitalization because of heart failure ( P interaction = @ ) , all-cause mortality ( P interaction = @ ) , and heart failure mortality ( P interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no evidence for a difference in safety profile according to SBP group .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy and safety of ivabradine is independent of SBP .
CONCLUSIONS	This may have implications for the management of HF patients with low SBP and elevated heart rate .

BACKGROUND	Studies demonstrate that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) using a statin is associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular events .
BACKGROUND	Whether visit-to-visit variability in LDL-C levels affects cardiovascular outcomes is unknown .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to evaluate the role of visit-to-visit variability in LDL-C levels on cardiovascular outcomes .
METHODS	We evaluated patients with coronary artery disease and LDL-C < @ mg/dl enrolled in the TNT ( Treating to New Targets ) trial , randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin @ mg/day versus @ mg/day and with at least one post-baseline measurement of LDL-C .
METHODS	Visit-to-visit LDL-C variability was evaluated from @ months into random assignment through the use of various measurements of LDL-C variability : SD , average successive variability ( ASV ) , coefficient of variation , and variation independent of mean , with the first @ measurements used as the primary measurements .
METHODS	Primary outcome was any coronary event , and secondary outcomes were any cardiovascular event , death , myocardial infarction , or stroke .
RESULTS	Among @,@ patients , SD and ASV were significantly lower with atorvastatin @ mg/day versus @ mg/day ( SD : @ @ vs. @ @ ; p = @ ; ASV : @ @ vs. @ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the adjusted model , each @-SD increase in LDL-C variability ( by ASV ) increased the risk of any coronary event by @ % ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ to @ ; p < @ ) , any cardiovascular event by @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p < @ ) , death by @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p < @ ) , myocardial infarction by @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) , and stroke by @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) , independent of treatment effect and achieved LDL-C levels .
RESULTS	Results were largely consistent when adjusted for medication adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	In subjects with coronary artery disease , visit-to-visit LDL-C variability is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) as adjunct to best medical practice ( VNS + BMP ) is superior to BMP alone in improving long-term health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) .
METHODS	PuLsE ( Open Prospective Randomized Long-term Effectiveness ) was a prospective , randomized , parallel-group , open-label , and long-term effectiveness study ( conducted at @ sites in Europe and Canada ) .
METHODS	Adults with pharmacoresistant focal seizures ( n = @ ) received VNS + BMP or BMP ( @:@ ratio ) .
METHODS	Medications and VNS parameters could be adjusted as clinically indicated for optimal seizure control while minimizing adverse effects .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline HRQoL ( using Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-@ total score ; QOLIE-@ ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included changes in seizure frequency , responder rate ( @ % decrease in seizure frequency ) , Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ( CES-D ) , Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory-Epilepsy scale ( NDDI-E ) , Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ) , Adverse Event Profile ( AEP ) , and antiepileptic drug ( AED ) load .
METHODS	The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment difficulties prior to completing the planned enrollment of n = @ .
METHODS	Results for n = @ who had baseline and at least one follow-up QOLIE-@ assessment ( from months @-@ ) were included in this analysis .
METHODS	Mixed model repeated measures ( MMRM ) analysis of variance was performed on change from baseline for the primary and secondary endpoints .
RESULTS	Significant between-group differences in favor of VNS + BMP were observed regarding improvement in HRQoL , seizure frequency , and CGI-I score ( respective p-values < @ , @ , and @ ) .
RESULTS	More patients in the VNS + BMP group ( @ % ) reported adverse events ( AEs ) versus BMP group ( @ % ) ( p = @ ) , a difference reflecting primarily mostly transient AEs related to VNS implantation or stimulation .
RESULTS	No significant difference between treatment groups was observed for changes in CES-D , NDDI-E , AEP , and AED load .
CONCLUSIONS	VNS therapy as a treatment adjunct to BMP in patients with pharmacoresistant focal seizures was associated with a significant improvement in HRQoL compared with BMP alone .

BACKGROUND	The MGuard , a bare metal stent covered with a polymer mesh , was designed to reduce distal embolization during percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction .
BACKGROUND	In the MGUARD for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion trial , the primary end point of complete ST-segment resolution was significantly improved with the MGuard compared with control .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated @-year clinical and angiographic results .
RESULTS	Patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction @ hours undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention of a single de novo native lesion were randomized to the MGuard versus any commercially available metallic stent ( @ % drug-eluting ) .
RESULTS	Clinical follow-up was performed through @ year , and angiography at @ months was planned in @ MGuard patients .
RESULTS	There was no difference in major adverse cardiac events ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) at @ days between the groups .
RESULTS	Major adverse cardiac events at @ year were higher with the MGuard , driven by greater ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Conversely , mortality tended to be lower with the MGuard at @ days ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) and at @ year ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Late lumen loss at @ months in the MGuard was @ mm , and binary restenosis was @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention , a trend toward reduced @-year mortality was present in patients treated with the MGuard stent .
CONCLUSIONS	Target lesion revascularization and major adverse cardiac events rates during follow-up were higher in the MGuard group than in the control stent group , and angiographic late loss of the MGuard was consistent with that expected from bare metal stents .

BACKGROUND	L-ornithine is a non-essential , non-protein amino acid .
BACKGROUND	Although L-ornithine is contained in various foods , the amount is usually small.Recently , studies have shown that orally administered L-ornithine reduced the stress response in animals.From these findings , we speculated that L-ornithine may play a role in the relieve of stress and improve sleep and fatigue symptoms in humans .
BACKGROUND	Through a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical study , we asked if L-ornithine could be beneficial to stress and sleep in healthy workers .
METHODS	Fifty-two apparently healthy Japanese adults who had previously felt slight stress as well as fatigue were recruited to be study participants and were randomly divided into either the L-ornithine ( @ mg/day ) or placebo group .
METHODS	They orally consumed the respective test substance every day for @ weeks .
METHODS	Serum was collected for the assessment of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate ( DHEA-S ) .
METHODS	Perceived mood and quality of sleep were measured by the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) , Athens Insomnia Scale ( AIS ) , and Ogri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version ( OSA-MA ) .
RESULTS	Serum cortisol levels and the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio were significantly decreased in the L-ornithine group in comparison with the placebo group .
RESULTS	Also , anger was reduced and perceived sleep quality was improved in the L-ornithine group .
CONCLUSIONS	L-ornithine supplementation has the potential to relieve stress and improve sleep quality related to fatigue , both objectively and subjectively .

OBJECTIVE	Development of new therapies for previously treated small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) is a major unmet need .
OBJECTIVE	Here , we describe a randomized , phase II trial of weekly topotecan with or without ziv-aflibercept ( VEGF-trap ) in this clinical setting .
METHODS	Patients with previously treated SCLC ( one line of platinum-based chemotherapy ) , performance status of @ to @ , adequate organ function , treated brain metastases , and no recent vascular events or bleeding diatheses were eligible .
METHODS	Eligible patients were stratified as platinum-sensitive or platinum-refractory and randomly assigned to receive weekly topotecan @ mg/m ( @ ) intravenously ( IV ) with or without ziv-aflibercept @ mg/kg IV every @ days .
METHODS	Progression-free survival ( PFS ) at @ months was the primary end point .
RESULTS	In @ randomly assigned patients , treatment arms were well balanced with regard to clinical characteristics .
RESULTS	The @-month PFS was significantly improved with the addition of ziv-aflibercept in patients who had platinum-refractory disease ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) but not in patients with platinum-sensitive disease ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Although response rate was low , disease control rate was higher with combination therapy than with topotecan alone in patients who had platinum-sensitive disease ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) and in those who had platinum-refractory disease ( @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall survival ( OS ) was not significantly improved in either strata .
RESULTS	Grades @ to @ toxicities were more common with the addition of ziv-aflibercept .
CONCLUSIONS	Ziv-aflibercept improved the @-month PFS in patients who had platinum-refractory SCLC , but its addition increased toxicity .
CONCLUSIONS	OS was similar with combined ziv-aflibercept and topotecan compared with topotecan in both strata .

BACKGROUND	Late enhancement MRI ( LE-MRI ) and cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) are sensitive methods to detect subclinical myocardial injury .
BACKGROUND	We sought to investigate the relation between plasma concentrations of cTnI measured with a high-sensitivity assay ( hs-cTnI ) and the development of unrecognized myocardial infarctions ( UMIs ) detected with LE-MRI .
METHODS	After approval from the ethics committee and written informed consent were obtained , LE-MRI was performed on @ randomly selected community-living @-year-old volunteers and hs-cTnI was determined with a highly sensitive premarket assay .
METHODS	Five years later these individuals were invited to a second LE-MRI , and @ of them ( @ women , @ men ) , who did not have a hospital diagnosis of MI , constitute the present study population .
METHODS	LE-MR images were analyzed by @ radiologists independently and in a consensus reading , blinded to any information on previous disease or assessments .
RESULTS	New or larger UMIs were detected in @ participants during follow-up .
RESULTS	Plasma concentrations of hs-cTnI at @ years of age , which were mainly within what is considered to be the reference interval , were related to new or larger UMIs at @ years of age with an odds ratio of @ per @ unit increase in ln-transformed cTnI ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Plasma concentrations of hs-cTnI at @ years of age were associated with the volumes of the UMIs detected at @ years of age ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	hs-cTnI in @-year-old community-living women and men was associated with the development of MRI-detected UMIs within @ years .

BACKGROUND	We investigated the effects of demographic , lifestyle ( self-reported smoking status and physical activity levels ) , cancer-related treatment factors ( radiation and chemotherapy ) , and diet ( calcium and vitamin D intake ) on bone turnover and the relationship of bone turnover to lumbar spine bone mineral density ( BMD ) Z-scores ( LS-BMD Z-scores ) determined by quantitative computed tomography ( QCT ) in @ @-year survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .
METHODS	Bone turnover was assessed by biomarkers including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( BALP ) , osteocalcin ( OC ) , and urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen indexed to creatinine ( NTX/Cr ) .
METHODS	The @ males ranged in age from @ to @ years ( median age @ years ) .
RESULTS	Age and tanner score were inversely associated with all biomarkers ( BALP , OC , NTX/Cr ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Males had higher BALP and OC than females ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Body mass index ( BMI ) was inversely associated with OC and NTX/Cr ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant association of biomarkers with lifestyle related factors , ALL treatment-related factors , dietary calcium , vitamin D , or LS-BMD Z-score .
CONCLUSIONS	In this population of long-term survivors of ALL , bone turnover was significantly associated with age , gender , tanner stage , and BMI .
CONCLUSIONS	ALL-related treatments did not influence bone turnover and bone turnover was not predictive of volumetric LS-BMD Z-score .

BACKGROUND	EBV-encoded latent membrane protein @ ( EBV-LMP@ ) is an important oncogenic protein for nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) and has been shown to engage a plethora of signaling pathways .
BACKGROUND	Correspondingly , an LMP@-targeted DNAzyme was found to inhibit the growth of NPC cells both in vivo and in vitro by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis .
BACKGROUND	However , it remains unknown whether an LMP@-targeted DNAzyme would affect the vasculature of NPC .
BACKGROUND	Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) has been applied in the clinical trials of anti-angiogenic drugs for more than ten years , and Ktrans has been recommended as a primary endpoint .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , the objective of the current study was to use DCE-MRI to longitudinally study the effect of an EBV-LMP@-targeted DNAzyme on the vasculature of patients with NPC .
METHODS	Twenty-four patients were randomly divided into two groups : a combined treatment group ( radiotherapy + LMP@-targeted DNAzyme ) and a radiotherapy alone group ( radiotherapy + normal saline ) .
METHODS	DCE-MRI scans were conducted @ ~ @ days before radiotherapy ( Pre-RT ) , during radiotherapy ( RT @ Gy ) , upon completion of radiotherapy ( RT @ Gy ) , and three months after radiotherapy ( @ months post-RT ) .
METHODS	Parameters of vascular permeability and intra - and extravascular volumes were subsequently obtained ( e.g. , Ktrans , kep , ve ) using nordicICE software .
RESULTS	Both Ktrans and kep values for NPC tumor tissues decreased for both groups after treatment .
RESULTS	Moreover , a statistically significant difference in Ktrans values at the pre-therapy and post-therapy timepoints emerged earlier for the combined treatment group ( RT @ Gy , P = @ ) compared to the radiotherapy alone group ( @ months post-RT , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For the kep values , the downward trend observed for both the combined treatment group and the radiotherapy alone group were similar .
RESULTS	In contrast , ve values for all of the tumor tissues increased following therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	The EBV-LMP@-targeted DNAzyme that was tested was found to accelerate the decline of Ktrans values for patients with NPC .
CONCLUSIONS	Correspondingly , the LMP@-targeted DNAzyme treatments were found to affect the angiogenesis and microvascular permeability of NPC .

OBJECTIVE	We aimed at comparing the long-term benefit-risk balance of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis .
METHODS	Long-term follow-up study of patients included in Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in Patients With Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis ( EVA-@S ) , a randomized , controlled trial of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy in @ patients with recently symptomatic severe carotid stenosis , conducted in @ centers in France .
METHODS	The main end point was a composite of any ipsilateral stroke after randomization or any procedural stroke or death .
RESULTS	During a median follow-up of @ years ( interquartile range , @-@ @ years ; maximum @ years ) , the primary end point occurred in @ patients in the stenting group compared with @ patients in the endarterectomy group .
RESULTS	Cumulative probabilities of this outcome were @ % ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) versus @ % ( @-@ @ ) in the endarterectomy group at the @-year follow-up ( hazard ratio , @ ; @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and @ % ( @-@ @ ) versus @ % ( @-@ @ ; hazard ratio , @ ; @-@ @ ; P = @ ) at the @-year follow-up .
RESULTS	No difference was observed between treatment groups in the rates of ipsilateral stroke beyond the procedural period , severe carotid restenosis ( @ % ) or occlusion , death , myocardial infarction , and revascularization procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	The long-term benefit-risk balance of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis favored endarterectomy , a difference driven by a lower risk of procedural stroke after endarterectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Both techniques were associated with low and similar long-term risks of recurrent ipsilateral stroke beyond the procedural period .

BACKGROUND	This work evaluates the effect of adding platelet-derived growth factor to autologous adipose tissue grafts in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus facial lipoatrophy by means of objective measurements .
METHODS	This is a randomized clinical trial conducted at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona .
METHODS	Patients with facial human immunodeficiency virus atrophy were randomized into two groups , one treated with autologous fat injection ( group A ) , and another treated with autologous fat injection with plasma rich in growth factors ( group B ) .
METHODS	Before the treatment , structural changes were identified in facial soft tissue by means of computed tomography , and clinical changes were also assessed by means of photographic records .
METHODS	Posttreatment assessments were repeated after @ and @ months to compare the results .
METHODS	Posttreatment complications were recorded .
RESULTS	Forty-nine patients ( @ men and @ women ) , with a mean age of @ years , participated in the study .
RESULTS	In both groups , there was a statistically significant average increase of volume in the facial area measured by computed tomography between the baseline and the @ - and @-month posttreatment assessments .
RESULTS	All cases showed an improvement of the clinical facial atrophy grade after treatment , which was statistically significant .
RESULTS	This improvement was related to a statistically significant fat volume increase measured by means of computed tomography .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the volume gain between both groups .
RESULTS	No major complications were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Fat grafting is a safe , effective , and durable treatment for human immunodeficiency virus facial atrophy .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study show that it is not necessary to add plasma rich in growth factors to the adipose tissue graft to get a better result .
METHODS	Therapeutic , II .

OBJECTIVE	In the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure trial , surgical ventricular reconstruction plus coronary artery bypass surgery was not associated with a reduction in the rate of death or cardiac hospitalization compared with bypass alone .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that the absence of viable myocardium identifies patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction who have a greater benefit with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and surgical ventricular reconstruction compared with bypass alone .
METHODS	Myocardial viability was assessed by single photon computed tomography in @ of the @ patients randomized to bypass or bypass plus surgical ventricular reconstruction in the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure .
METHODS	Myocardial viability was assessed on a per patient basis and regionally according to prespecified criteria .
RESULTS	At @ years , there was no difference in mortality or the combined outcome of death or cardiac hospitalization between those with and without viability , and there was no significant interaction between the type of surgery and the global viability status with respect to mortality or death plus cardiac hospitalization .
RESULTS	Furthermore , there was no difference in mortality or death plus cardiac hospitalization between those with and without anterior wall or apical scar , and no significant interaction between the presence of scar in these regions and the type of surgery with respect to mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with coronary artery disease and severe regional left ventricular dysfunction , assessment of myocardial viability does not identify patients who will derive a mortality benefit from adding surgical ventricular reconstruction to coronary artery bypass graft surgery .

BACKGROUND	To prevent salivary dysfunction in thyroid cancer patients who have undergone radioiodine ablation , massaging the parotid gland ( PG ) is presumed to be helpful for the removal of radioiodine .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of PG massage in the removal of radioiodine from the PG .
METHODS	Forty-four patients ( female , @ ; @ @ years ) who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by I-@ ablation were included in this prospective study .
METHODS	Three serial salivary gland scans were performed @h after administration of I-@ in thyroid hormone withdrawal status .
METHODS	The patients were divided into two groups .
METHODS	There was a @-min ( or @-min ) interval between the first and second scans for control , followed by the performance of PG massage for @ min ( or @ min ) between the second and third scans .
METHODS	Changes in uptakes were calculated between the first and second scans ( control ) and between the second and third scans ( massage ) .
RESULTS	The mean change in uptake at the @-min massage was @ @ % , whereas that at the @-min control was @ @ % ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean change in uptake at the @-min massage was also significantly lower than that at the @-min control ( @ @ vs. -@ @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , no statistical difference was observed between the mean changes in uptake after @ - and @-min massages ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	PG massage reduced the radioiodine uptake in the PG , and the effect of PG massage for @ min was comparable with that of PG massage for @ min .
CONCLUSIONS	PG massage can be applied to thyroid cancer patients who receive radioiodine therapy to reduce PG dysfunction .

OBJECTIVE	Executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) in children is common and leads to significant short - and long-term problems in functioning across multiple settings .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that improvements in short-term executive function would be maintained to @ months after injury and that improvements would increase over time in a counselor-assisted problem-solving ( CAPS ) intervention .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of a CAPS intervention administered within @ months of complicated mild to severe TBI compared with an Internet resource condition in improving long-term executive dysfunction .
METHODS	Multisite , assessor-blinded , randomized clinical trial at @ tertiary pediatric hospitals and @ tertiary general medical centers .
METHODS	Participants included @ adolescents aged @ to @ years who sustained a moderate to severe TBI @ to @ months before study enrollment .
METHODS	Web-based CAPS intervention .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the parent-reported Global Executive Composite ( GEC ) of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included the Behavioral Regulation Index ( BRI ) and Metacognition Index ( MI ) of the GEC .
RESULTS	In older ( > @ to @ years ) adolescents , the CAPS intervention was associated with lower GEC ratings at @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) and @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) months after enrollment .
RESULTS	Trends were also observed for older adolescents toward lower GEC ratings at @ months ( = -@ ; P = @ ) , lower BRI ratings at @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) and @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) months , and lower MI ratings at @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) , @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) , and @ ( = -@ ; P = @ ) months .
RESULTS	In younger ( @-@ years ) adolescents , no group differences were found on the GEC , BRI , or MI ratings .
CONCLUSIONS	Delivery of the CAPS intervention early after TBI in older adolescents improves long-term executive function .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial is , to our knowledge , one of the few large , randomized clinical treatment trials performed in pediatric TBI to demonstrate the efficacy of an intervention for management of executive dysfunction and long-term benefits of an intervention delivered soon after injury .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of the CAPS intervention clinically should be considered ; however , further research should explore ways to optimize delivery .

BACKGROUND	Pain control has been emphasized as a priority for both practitioners and inpatients with rib fractures , since analgesia could only offer limited relief from severe pain .
BACKGROUND	A prospective and randomized controlled trial was conducted to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of acupuncture in acute pain relief for inpatients with rib fractures .
METHODS	A total of @ inpatients were recruited and allocated to two groups , receiving identical doses of conventional oral analgesics as well as filiform needles as treatment and thumbtack intradermal ( TI ) needles placed upon the skin surface as a control , respectively , via novel acupuncture modality once daily for three consecutive days .
METHODS	The effect of pain relief was evaluated during activities that induce pain , and sustained maximal inspiration ( SMI ) lung volumes and sleep quality were assessed .
RESULTS	The patients treated with filiform needles had more effective pain relief than those in the TI needle group during deep breathing , coughing , and turning over the body ( p < @ ) , and the effect persisted for at least @ h in most patients .
RESULTS	Sustained maximal inspiration lung volumes and sleep quality did not show improvement through every acupuncture intervention , and they could not respond accurately to pain relief via acupuncture .
CONCLUSIONS	The active evaluation could provide a more adaptive model for assessing pain intensity due to rib fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	This novel acupuncture modality in which the needle insertion sites are corresponding to the pain spots can be a safe and viable therapy for relieving pain in inpatients with rib fractures .

BACKGROUND	Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) is a pre-diabetic state of hyperglycemia that is associated with insulin resistance , increased risk of type II diabetes , and cardiovascular pathology .
BACKGROUND	Recently , investigators hypothesized that decreased vagus nerve activity may be the underlying mechanism of metabolic syndrome including obesity , elevated glucose levels , and high blood pressure .
METHODS	In this pilot randomized clinical trial , we compared the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation ( taVNS ) and sham taVNS on patients with IGT .
METHODS	@ participants with IGT were single-blinded and were randomly allocated by computer-generated envelope to either taVNS or sham taVNS treatment groups .
METHODS	In addition , @ IGT adults were recruited as a control population and not assigned treatment so as to monitor the natural fluctuation of glucose tolerance in IGT patients .
METHODS	All treatments were self-administered by the patients at home after training at the hospital .
METHODS	Patients were instructed to fill in a patient diary booklet each day to describe any side effects after each treatment .
METHODS	The treatment period was @weeks in duration .
METHODS	Baseline comparison between treatment and control group showed no difference in weight , BMI , or measures of systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , @-hour plasma glucose ( @hPG ) , or glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbAlc ) .
RESULTS	@ participants completed the study and were included in data analysis .
RESULTS	Two female patients ( one in the taVNS group , one in the sham taVNS group ) dropped out of the study due to stimulation-evoked dizziness .
RESULTS	The symptoms were relieved after stopping treatment .
RESULTS	Compared with sham taVNS , taVNS significantly reduced the two-hour glucose tolerance ( F ( @ ) = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , we found that taVNS significantly decreased ( F ( @ ) = @ , p = @ ) systolic blood pressure over time compared with sham taVNS .
RESULTS	Compared with the no-treatment control group , patients receiving taVNS significantly differed in measures of FPG ( F ( @ ) = @ , p < @ ) , @hPG F ( @ ) = @ , p < @ ) and HbAlc ( F ( @ ) = @ , p = @ ) over the course of the @week treatment period .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study suggests that taVNS is a promising , simple , and cost-effective treatment for IGT / pre-diabetes with only slight risk of mild side-effects .

BACKGROUND	South Africa has @ million adults over the age of @ living with HIV .
BACKGROUND	Gender inequality issues continue to drive the HIV epidemic in South Africa , where Black African women bear the greatest HIV burden .
BACKGROUND	Limited access to services ; little capacity to negotiate sex and condom use ; and other legal , social , and economic inequities make women highly vulnerable to HIV infection .
BACKGROUND	Behavioral interventions have been shown to decrease risk behaviors , but they have been less successful in reducing HIV incidence .
BACKGROUND	Conversely , biomedical prevention strategies have proven to be successful in reducing HIV incidence , but require behavioral interventions to increase uptake and adherence .
BACKGROUND	Consequently , there is a need for integrated approaches that combine biomedical and behavioral interventions .
BACKGROUND	Effective combination prevention efforts should comprise biomedical , behavioral , and structural programming proven in randomized trials that focuses on the driving forces and key populations at higher risk of HIV infection and transmission .
METHODS	This prospective , geographically clustered randomized field experiment is enrolling participants into two arms : a control arm that receives standard HIV testing and referral for treatment ; and an intervention arm that receives an evidence-based , woman-focused behavioral intervention that emphasizes risk reduction and retention , the Women 's Health CoOp .
METHODS	We divided the city of Pretoria into @ mutually exclusive geographic zones and randomized these zones into either the control arm or the intervention arm .
METHODS	Outreach workers are recruiting drug-using women from each zone .
METHODS	At baseline , eligible participants complete a questionnaire and biological testing for HIV , recent drug use , and pregnancy .
METHODS	Follow-up interviews are completed at @ and @months .
CONCLUSIONS	The biobehavioral intervention in this study merges an efficacious behavioral HIV prevention intervention for women with biomedical prevention through HIV treatment as prevention using a Seek , Test , Treat and Retain strategy .
CONCLUSIONS	This combination biobehavioral intervention is designed to ( @ ) improve the quality of life and reduce HIV infectiousness among women who are HIV positive , and ( @ ) reduce HIV risk behaviors among women regardless of their HIV status .
CONCLUSIONS	If efficacious , this intervention could help control the HIV epidemic in South Africa .

BACKGROUND	Delirium occurs frequently in older hospitalised patients and is associated with several adverse outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Ignorance among healthcare professionals and a failure to recognise patients suffering from delirium have been identified as the possible causes of poor care .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the study was to determine whether e-learning can be an effective means of improving implementation of a quality improvement project in delirium care .
BACKGROUND	This project aims primarily at improving the early recognition of older patients who are at risk of delirium .
METHODS	In a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial an e-learning course on delirium was introduced , aimed at nursing staff .
METHODS	The trial was conducted on general medical and surgical wards from @ Dutch hospitals .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the delirium risk screening conducted by nursing staff , measured through monthly patient record reviews .
METHODS	Patient records from patients aged @ and over admitted onto wards participating in the study were used for data collection .
METHODS	Data was also collected on the level of delirium knowledge of these wards ' nursing staff .
RESULTS	Records from @,@ older patients were included during the control phase and from @,@ patients during the intervention phase .
RESULTS	The e-learning course on delirium had a significant positive effect on the risk screening of older patients by nursing staff ( OR @ , p-value < @ ) , as well as on other aspects of delirium care .
RESULTS	The number of patients diagnosed with delirium was reduced from @ % in the control phase to @ % in the intervention phase ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The e-learning course also showed a significant positive effect on nurses ' knowledge of delirium .
CONCLUSIONS	Nurses who undertook a delirium e-learning course showed a greater adherence to the quality improvement project in delirium care .
CONCLUSIONS	This improved the recognition of patients at risk and demonstrated that e-learning can be a valuable instrument for hospitals when implementing improvements in delirium care .

BACKGROUND	Smoking now represents one of the biggest modifiable risk factors for disease and mortality in people living with HIV ( PLHIV ) .
BACKGROUND	To produce significant changes in smoking rates among this population , treatments will need to be both acceptable to the larger segment of PLHIV smokers and feasible to implement in busy HIV clinics .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effects of a novel proactive algorithm-based intervention in an HIV/AIDS clinic .
METHODS	PLHIV smokers ( N = @ ) were proactively identified through their electronic medical records and were subsequently randomized at baseline to receive a @-week pharmacotherapy-based algorithm treatment or treatment as usual .
METHODS	Participants were tracked in-person for @ weeks .
METHODS	Participants provided information on smoking behaviors and associated constructs of cessation at each follow-up session .
RESULTS	The findings revealed that many smokers reported using prescribed medications when provided with a supply of cessation medication as determined by an algorithm .
RESULTS	Compared with smokers receiving treatment as usual , PLHIV smokers prescribed these medications reported more quit attempts and greater reduction in smoking .
RESULTS	Proxy measures of cessation readiness ( eg , motivation , self-efficacy ) also favored participants receiving algorithm treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	This algorithm-derived treatment produced positive changes across a number of important clinical markers associated with smoking cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	Given these promising findings coupled with the brief nature of this treatment , the overall pattern of results suggests strong potential for dissemination into clinical settings and significant promise for further advancing clinical health outcomes in this population .

OBJECTIVE	To assess efficacy and safety of post-operative intra-peritoneal wash with lactated Ringer 's for @h after myomectomy in reduction of adhesions compared to routine intra-operative irrigation .
OBJECTIVE	Study design A prospective , randomized trial that included @ eligible participants who had undergone abdominal myomectomy .
OBJECTIVE	Participants were randomly allocated to a treatment group ( n = @ ) which was subjected to continuous peritoneal wash for @h via two intraperitoneal drains , and a control group ( n = @ ) .
OBJECTIVE	The incidence of de novo adhesions and their severity and extent were scored at a second-look laparoscopy @-@ weeks postoperatively .
OBJECTIVE	Adhesions were graded using the local adhesion barrier scoring system score .
OBJECTIVE	Adverse effects were also assessed and reported .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in duration of hospital stay or in the incidence of adverse events .
RESULTS	A significantly higher proportion of adhesion-free patients was found in the treatment group -LSB- @/@ , @ % -RSB- compared to the control group -LSB- @/@ , @ % -RSB- ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean number of pelvic sites covered by adhesions was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group ( @ versus @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The total adhesion score was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group ( @ versus @ , P < @ ) and the adhesion score was significantly lower at most of the individual anatomical sites .
CONCLUSIONS	Application of postoperative intraperitoneal wash with lactated Ringer 's solution for @h may have reasonable safety and efficacy in minimizing postoperative pelvic de novo adhesions following abdominal myomectomy .

BACKGROUND	In the AXIS trial , axitinib prolonged progression-free survival ( PFS ) vs sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) previously treated with sunitinib or cytokines .
METHODS	In post hoc analyses , patients were grouped by objective response to prior therapy ( yes vs no ) , prior therapy duration ( < vs median ) , and tumour burden ( baseline sum of the longest diameter < vs median ) .
METHODS	PFS and overall survival ( OS ) , and safety by type and duration of prior therapy were evaluated .
RESULTS	Response to prior therapy did not influence outcome with second-line axitinib or sorafenib .
RESULTS	PFS was significantly longer in axitinib-treated patients who received longer prior cytokine treatment and sorafenib-treated patients with smaller tumour burden following sunitinib .
RESULTS	Overall survival with the second-line therapy was longer in patients who received longer duration of prior therapy , although not significant in the sunitinib-to-axitinib sequence subgroup ; OS was also longer in patients with smaller tumour burden , but not significant in the cytokine-to-axitinib sequence subgroup .
RESULTS	Safety profiles differed modestly by type and duration of prior therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	AXIS data suggest that longer duration of the first-line therapy generally yields better outcome with the second-line therapy and that lack of response to first-line therapy does not preclude positive clinical outcomes with a second-line vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted agent in patients with advanced RCC .

OBJECTIVE	To examine baseline predictors of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity ( MVPA ) at the @-week follow-up in a sample of adults with arthritis participating in a self-directed , multicomponent exercise program .
METHODS	Pretest-posttest .
METHODS	Analyses were limited to those randomized to the exercise intervention .
METHODS	Participants ( n = @ ) completed a survey assessing demographic , health-related , and arthritis-related factors , and completed anthropometric and functional measurements at baseline .
METHODS	Self-reported MVPA was assessed at baseline and @ weeks .
METHODS	Participants were classified as engaging in @ or < @ h/week of MVPA at the @-week follow-up .
METHODS	Baseline demographic , health-related , arthritis-related , and functional factors were examined as predictors of engaging in @ h of MVPA .
RESULTS	At the @-week follow-up , @ % ( n = @ ) of participants engaged in @ h/week of MVPA .
RESULTS	Those with a higher body mass index , more days with poor physical health , a greater number of health conditions , self-reported hypertension , self-reported high cholesterol , and greater pain and stiffness were less likely to engage in @ h of MVPA at the @-week follow-up ; those with greater arthritis self-efficacy and better performance on the @ minute walk test were more likely .
RESULTS	None of the other factors examined were associated with MVPA .
CONCLUSIONS	This study uncovered health-related , arthritis-related , and functional factors associated with MVPA that may help guide intervention strategies .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants with less severe symptoms , better functional performance and fewer comorbidities at baseline were more likely to achieve the recommended MVPA level at @ weeks ; therefore self-directed PA interventions may be best suited for those with relatively good health status despite arthritis , while those with worse symptoms and health status may benefit more from other intervention delivery modalities such as structured , individualized programs where additional support for managing arthritis symptoms and comorbidity can be addressed .

BACKGROUND	The relative effects of radiation dose escalation ( RDE ) and androgen suppression ( AS ) duration on local prostatic progression ( LP ) remain unclear .
METHODS	We addressed this in the TROG @ RADAR trial by incorporating a RDE programme by stratification at randomisation .
METHODS	Men were allocated @ or @ months AS@ months zoledronate ( Z ) .
METHODS	The main endpoint was a composite of clinically diagnosed LP or PSA progression with a PSA doubling time @ months .
METHODS	Fine and Gray competing risk modelling with adjustment for site clustering produced cumulative incidence estimates at @ years for each RDE group .
RESULTS	Composite LP declined coherently in the @ , @ and @ Gy external beam dosing groups and was lowest in the high dose rate brachytherapy boost ( HDRB ) group .
RESULTS	At @ years , adjusted cumulative incidences were @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % respectively .
RESULTS	Compared to @ months AS , @ months AS also significantly reduced LP ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Post-radiation urethral strictures were documented in @ subjects and increased incrementally in the dosing groups .
RESULTS	Crude incidences were @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	RDE and increasing AS independently reduce LP and increase urethral strictures .
CONCLUSIONS	The risks and benefits to the individual must be balanced when selecting radiation dose and AS duration .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory therapy on selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) outcomes .
METHODS	Randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Patients with primary open-angle or pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma .
METHODS	Patients undergoing SLT were randomized to receive placebo ( artificial tears ) , prednisolone acetate @ % , or ketorolac tromethamine @ % eye drops @ times per day for @ days commencing immediately after SLT .
METHODS	Change in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) from baseline to the @-month post-SLT visit .
RESULTS	Mean change in IOP at the @-month primary outcome time point , as well as all other time points , was not significantly different among groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Likewise , a repeated-measures , mixed-effects model did not find significant differences in IOP outcome at the @-month time point ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The IOP was reduced in all groups at the @-month post-SLT time point and all other time points , and no significant differences were found between groups using separate unadjusted cross-sectional analyses of variance ( P > @ for analyses at all time points ) .
RESULTS	Treatment failure rates were not different among groups ( P = @ ) , and at @ year after SLT , the percentage of patients maintaining a @ % IOP reduction ranged from @ % to @ % in the @ study groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Anti-inflammatory therapy after SLT does not seem to substantially influence the IOP-lowering effect of SLT .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study of patients with low baseline IOP , SLT showed limited efficacy in achieving a sustained reduction in IOP .

###24642133
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present randomized study was to evaluate the efficacy of intermaxillary fixation screw ( IMFS ) versus eyelet interdental wiring for intermaxillary fixation ( IMF ) in minimally displaced mandibular fractures .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with a minimally displaced mandibular fracture were enrolled , with @ patients randomly selected for each group .
METHODS	In group I ( study group , n = @ ) , the patients were treated using IMFS , and in group II ( control group , n = @ ) , they received eyelet interdental wiring .
METHODS	Both techniques were assessed for the following parameters : time required for placement and removal of each type of IMF technique , time required for placement of IMF wires , postoperative occlusion , stability of the IMF wire , local anesthesia requirement during removal of each fixation type , oral hygiene status , glove perforation rate , and complications associated with both techniques .
METHODS	The collected data were analyzed using Student 's unpaired t test or @ test .
METHODS	P < @ was considered significant and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software , version @ , was used for analysis .
RESULTS	The average time required for placement in groups I and II was @ and @ minutes , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The time required for placement of the IMF wire in group I was @ minutes and in group II was @ minutes .
RESULTS	The oral hygiene status was assessed , and the mean plaque index score for groups I and II was @ and @ , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The glove perforation rate was much less in group I than in group II .
RESULTS	Finally , the most common complication in both groups was mucosal growth .
CONCLUSIONS	The results established the supremacy of IMFS compared with eyelet interdental wiring .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , we have concluded that IMFS , in the present scenario , is a safe and time-saving technique .
CONCLUSIONS	IMFS is a cost-effective , straightforward , and viable alternative to cumbersome eyelet interdental and other wiring techniques for providing IMF , with satisfactory occlusion during closed reduction or intraoperative open reduction internal fixation of fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , oral hygiene can be maintained , and the glove perforation rate was very low using IMFS .
CONCLUSIONS	The relatively small sample size and limited follow-up period were the study limitations .

METHODS	Patients received artesunate , administered orally at a daily dose of either @ mg per kilogram of body weight per day or @ mg per kilogram , for @ days , followed by a standard @-day course of artemisinin-based combination therapy .
METHODS	Parasite counts in peripheral-blood samples were measured every @ hours , and the parasite clearance half-lives were determined .
RESULTS	The median parasite clearance half-lives ranged from @ hours in the Democratic Republic of Congo to @ hours at the Thailand-Cambodia border .
RESULTS	Slowly clearing infections ( parasite clearance half-life > @ hours ) , strongly associated with single point mutations in the `` propeller '' region of the P. falciparum kelch protein gene on chromosome @ ( kelch@ ) , were detected throughout mainland Southeast Asia from southern Vietnam to central Myanmar .
RESULTS	The incidence of pretreatment and post-treatment gametocytemia was higher among patients with slow parasite clearance , suggesting greater potential for transmission .
RESULTS	In western Cambodia , where artemisinin-based combination therapies are failing , the @-day course of antimalarial therapy was associated with a cure rate of @ % ( @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ) at @ days .
CONCLUSIONS	Artemisinin resistance to P. falciparum , which is now prevalent across mainland Southeast Asia , is associated with mutations in kelch@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Prolonged courses of artemisinin-based combination therapies are currently efficacious in areas where standard @-day treatments are failing .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by the U.K. Department of International Development and others ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

BACKGROUND	Benzodiazepines ( BDZs ) are the gold standard in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) .
BACKGROUND	Sodium oxybate ( SMO ) has been tested as a treatment for AWS with encouraging results .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this phase IV , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , double-dummy study was to evaluate the efficacy of SMO in comparison with oxazepam in the treatment of uncomplicated AWS .
METHODS	Alcohol-dependent outpatients ( n = @ ) affected by uncomplicated AWS according to the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised ( CIWA-Ar ) scale were enrolled in the study and randomized in two groups : @ patients received SMO and @ patients received oxazepam for @ days .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the reduction of symptoms of AWS measured by the change in the total CIWA-Ar score from baseline ( day @ ) to the end of the study ( day @ ) .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number : NCT@ RESULTS : A significant decrease of the mean total CIWA-Ar score from baseline to the end of the study was found in both the SMO ( p < @ ) and the oxazepam group ( p < @ ) , with no significant differences between the two treatments ( p = @ ) .
METHODS	Treatment with SMO and oxazepam resulted in a marked decrease in the severity of the mean CIWA subscales , i.e. sweating , tremor , and anxiety , with no significant differences between the two treatments .
METHODS	Both drugs were well tolerated and no severe side effects were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	SMO is as effective as oxazepam , one of the gold standard BDZs , in the treatment of uncomplicated AWS .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to its tolerability and absence of significant side effects , SMO may be considered a valid alternative choice in the treatment of AWS .

BACKGROUND	Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Malaysian women with an ASR of @ and a mortality rate of @ per @,@ population in @ ( GLOBOCAN , @ ) .
BACKGROUND	The @ year prevalence was estimated to be @ per @,@ population .
BACKGROUND	As the second most common cancer affecting productive females , cervical cancer imposes an impact to the socioeconomic aspect of the country .
BACKGROUND	However , the poor uptake of cervical cancer screening is a major problem in detecting early pre-cancerous lesions and thus , delay in initiating treatment for cervical cancer .
BACKGROUND	Realizing the urgency to increase the uptake of PAP smear , besides enhancing the promotion of PAP smear screening for women above @ years old , the call-recall system for pap smear screening had been piloted in one of the suburban districts which aimed to improve regular participation of women for cervical and breast cancer screening .
BACKGROUND	This is of public health importance as identifying the best feasible option to increase patient 's respond to participate in the screening program effectively in our setting will be helpful in implementing an organized regular population based screening program tailored to our setting .
BACKGROUND	The pilot program of cervical cancer screening in Klang was an opportunity to assess different options in recalling patients for a repeat pap smear to increase their participation and adherence to the program .
RESULTS	This was a population based randomized control trial .
RESULTS	Women aged @-@ years in the population that matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria were re-called for a repeat smear .
RESULTS	There are four different intervention groups ; letter , registered letters , short messages services ( SMS ) and phone calls where @ subjects were recruited into each group .
RESULTS	Samples were generated randomly from the same population in Klang into four different groups .
RESULTS	The first group received a recall letter for a repeat smear similar to the one that has been given during the first invitation .
RESULTS	The intervention groups were either be given a registered letter , an SMS or a phone call to re-call them .
RESULTS	The socio-demographic data of the patients who came for uptake were collected for further analysis .
RESULTS	All the groups were followed up after @ weeks to assess their compliance to the recall .
CONCLUSIONS	The study will provide recommendations about the most effective methods for recall in a population based pap smear screening program on two outcomes : i ) patients response ; ii ) uptake for repeat pap smear .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and placental transfer of intravenous ( i.v. ) N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) in mothers with a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis ( CA ) and determine the PK of i.v. NAC in their infants .
METHODS	In this prospective , double-blind study i.v. NAC @ mg/kg/dose or saline was administered within @ hours of CA diagnosis to pregnant women @ weeks ' gestation and then every @ hours until delivery .
METHODS	Maternal PK and placental transfer were determined with maternal blood and matched maternal and cord venous blood .
METHODS	Neonatal PK estimates were determined from i.v. NAC ( @-@ mg/kg/dose ) administered every @ hours for @ doses .
METHODS	Noncompartmental analyses were performed for maternal and neonatal PK estimates .
RESULTS	Eleven mothers ( @ preterm , @ near-term ) and @ infants ( @ set of twins ) received NAC .
RESULTS	Maternal clearance ( CL ) of NAC was faster than in nonpregnant adults , with a terminal elimination half-life of @ @ hours .
RESULTS	The NAC cord to maternal ratio was @ @ , suggesting rapid placental transfer and slower rate of fetal CL .
RESULTS	Neonatal PK estimates for near-term compared with preterm infants showed a significantly shorter terminal elimination half-life ( @ vs @ hours , respectively ) and greater CL ( @ vs @ mL/h/kg , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal CL and placental transfer of NAC was rapid , with umbilical cord concentrations frequently exceeding maternal concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	The administration of NAC to mothers with CA achieves predictable NAC plasma concentrations in the fetus , indicating that antenatal neuroprotection may be possible for these newborns at high risk for neuroinflammation .

OBJECTIVE	Despite promising results of Er : YAG laser in periodontal debridement , to date there is no consensus about the ideal settings for clinical use .
OBJECTIVE	This experimental clinical trial aimed to determine the effects of debridement using Er : YAG laser and to compare with ultrasonic treatment .
METHODS	Sixty-four teeth were divided into two in vivo and in vitro subgroups .
METHODS	Each tooth received ultrasonic treatment on one side and Er : YAG laser debridement at either @ , @ , @ or @ mJ pulse ( -@ ) and at @ Hz on the other side on a random basis .
METHODS	All samples were morphologically analyzed afterwards under scanning electron microscope for surface changes and dentinal tubules exposure .
METHODS	Treatment duration ( d ) was also recorded .
RESULTS	Laser debridement produced an irregular , rough and flaky surface free of carbonization or meltdown while ultrasound produced a relatively smoother surface .
RESULTS	The number of exposed dentinal tubules ( n ) followed an energy-dependent trend .
RESULTS	The number of exposed tubules among the in vivo laser groups was n @ mJ = n @ mJ < n @ mJ < n @ mJ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Also @ and @ mJ lasers led to significantly more dentinal exposure than ultrasound under in vivo condition .
RESULTS	Within the in vitro laser groups , dentinal tubules exposure was n @ mJ < n @ mJ < n @ mJ < n @ mJ ( P @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , in vitro laser treatments at @ , @ and @ mJ led to significantly more dentinal denudation than ultrasound .
RESULTS	Treatment duration ( d ) for the in vivo groups was d @ mJ > d @ mJ > d Ultrasound = d @ mJ > d @ mJ ( P @ ) , while for the in vitro groups it was d @ mJ > d @ mJ = d Ultrasound = d @ mJ > d @ mJ ( P @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to excessive treatment duration and surface damage , Er : YAG laser debridement at @ and @ mJ pulse ( -@ ) , respectively , is not appropriate for clinical use .
CONCLUSIONS	Although laser debridement at @ and @ mJ pulse ( -@ ) seems more suitable for clinical application , compared to ultrasound the former is more time-consuming and the latter is more aggressive .
CONCLUSIONS	Using a feedback device or lower pulse energies are recommended when using laser in closed field .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether dexmedetomidine sedation in the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) could decrease agitation and delirium after free flap surgery .
METHODS	Eighty patients were randomly divided into @ groups .
METHODS	In the experimental group , dexmedetomidine was given at an hourly infusion rate of @ g/kg for @hour before the operation was completed and continued in the PACU at @ to @ g/kg continuously until the next morning .
METHODS	In the control group , normal saline was given during the same periods .
METHODS	Patients in the @ groups received sufentanil and midazolam for sedation and pain relief when necessary .
METHODS	Agitation was monitored with the Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale in the PACU and delirium was monitored with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit for @days postoperatively .
RESULTS	The overall incidence of agitation was similar between the @ groups .
RESULTS	However , when the influence of patient shifting was excluded , the incidence of agitation in the dexmedetomidine group was apparently lower than that in the control group ( @ vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No difference was found in the occurrence of delirium between the experimental and control groups ( @ vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dexmedetomidine does not change the overall incidence of agitation after free flap surgery ; however , it does decrease agitation after PACU admission .
CONCLUSIONS	It does not prevent delirium within @days postoperatively .

BACKGROUND	Through many years , the standard care has been to use continuous sedation of critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation .
BACKGROUND	However , preliminary randomised clinical trials indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level .
BACKGROUND	No randomised trial has been conducted comparing sedation with no sedation , a priori powered to have all-cause mortality as primary outcome.The objective is to assess the benefits and harms of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial in critically ill patients .
METHODS	The non-sedation ( NONSEDA ) trial is an investigator-initiated , randomised , clinical , parallel-group , multinational trial designed to include @ patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark , Norway and Sweden.Inclusion criteria are mechanically ventilated patients with expected duration of mechanical ventilation > @ hours.Exclusion criteria are non-intubated patients , patients with severe head trauma , coma at admission or status epilepticus , patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia , patients with PaO@/FiO@ < @ where sedation might be necessary to ensure sufficient oxygenation or place the patient in prone position.Experimental intervention is non-sedation supplemented with pain management during mechanical ventilation.Control intervention is sedation with a daily wake-up trial.The primary outcome will be all cause mortality at @ days after randomization .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will be : days until death throughout the total observation period ; coma - and delirium-free days ; highest RIFLE score ; days until discharge from the intensive care unit ( within @ days ) ; days until the participant is without mechanical ventilation ( within @ days ) ; and proportion of patients with a major cardiovascular outcome .
METHODS	Explorative outcomes will be : all cause mortality at @ days after randomisation ; days until discharge from the intensive care unit ; days until the participant is without mechanical ventilation ; days until discharge from the hospital ; organ failure.Trial size : we will include @ participants ( @ ) in order to detect or reject @ % relative risk reduction in mortality with a type I error risk of @ % and a type II error risk of @ % ( power at @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The trial investigates potential benefits of non-sedation .
CONCLUSIONS	This might have large impact on the future treatment of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients .

OBJECTIVE	Assessing the immunogenicity of a single dose of hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) vaccines is important because some people receive only a single dose .
OBJECTIVE	However , previous studies have shown variable results and have not examined the effects of demographic characteristics other than gender .
OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to examine the immunogenicity of a single dose of HAV vaccine according to the vaccine type and demographic characteristics in young adults .
METHODS	Seronegative medical school students were randomly allocated to receive either Havrix or Epaxal .
RESULTS	After approximately @ months , the seroconversion rate in @ participants was @ % .
RESULTS	In men , the Havrix group showed a significantly higher seroconversion rate ( @ % ) than the Epaxal group ( @ % ) , whereas both vaccine groups showed similarly high immunogenicity in women ( Havrix : @ % , Epaxal : @ % ; P for interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	According to the results of a multivariate analysis , Epaxal showed significantly lower immunogenicity than Havrix only in men .
RESULTS	Age , obesity , drinking , smoking , and follow-up time did not significantly affect seroconversion in either gender .
CONCLUSIONS	The seroconversion rate of single-dose HAV vaccines was low in men , particularly in those who received Epaxal .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that gender effects should be considered when comparing the immunogenicity of different HAV vaccines .

BACKGROUND	Acute hydrocephalus is a well-known sequela of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) .
BACKGROUND	Controversy exists about whether open microsurgical methods serve to reduce shunt dependency compared with endovascular techniques .
OBJECTIVE	To determine predictors of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and functional outcomes after aneurysmal SAH .
METHODS	A total of @ patients who were part of a prospective , randomized , controlled trial from @ to @ were retrospectively reviewed .
METHODS	All variables including demographic data , medical history , treatment , imaging , and functional outcomes were included as part of the trial .
METHODS	No additional variables were retrospectively collected .
RESULTS	Ultimately , @ patients ( @ % ) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS ) in our series .
RESULTS	Age , dissecting aneurysm type , ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm , Fisher grade , Hunt and Hess grade , admission intraventricular hemorrhage , admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage , blood in the fourth ventricle on admission , perioperative ventriculostomy , and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors ( P < @ ) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis .
RESULTS	On multivariate analysis , intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses .
RESULTS	Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work @ months after surgery ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no difference in shunt dependency after SAH among patients treated by endovascular or microsurgical means .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients in whom shunt-dependent hydrocephalus does not develop after SAH tend to have improved long-term functional outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Acute neural effects of antidepressant medication on emotion processing biases may provide the foundation on which clinical outcomes are based .
BACKGROUND	Along with effects on positive and negative stimuli , acute effects on neutral stimuli may also relate to antidepressant efficacy , yet these effects are still to be investigated .
BACKGROUND	The present study therefore examined the impact of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram ( @ mg ) on positive , negative and neutral stimuli using pharmaco-fMRI .
METHODS	Within a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled crossover design , healthy women completed @ sessions of treatment administration and fMRI scanning separated by a @-week washout period .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ women in our study .
RESULTS	When participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , left amygdala activity was increased and right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) activity was decreased during presentation of positive pictures ( potentiation of positive emotion processing ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , escitalopram was associated with decreased left amygdala and increased right IFG activity during presentation of negative pictures ( attenuation of negative emotion processing ) .
RESULTS	In addition , escitalopram decreased right IFG activity during the processing of neutral stimuli , akin to the effects on positive stimuli ( decrease in negative appraisal ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although we used a women-only sample to reduce heterogeneity , our results may not generalize to men .
CONCLUSIONS	Potential unblinding , which was related to the subjective occurrence of side effects , occurred in the study ; however , manipulation check analyses demonstrated that results were not impacted .
CONCLUSIONS	These novel findings demonstrate that a single dose of the commonly prescribed escitalopram facilitates a positive information processing bias .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings provide an important lead for better understanding effects of antidepressant medication .

OBJECTIVE	We explored whether preoperative rosuvastatin could protect the cardiac health of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing emergency , noncardiac surgery .
METHODS	We randomized @ noncardiac emergency surgery patients with stable coronary artery disease on long-term statin therapy to treatment with and without preoperative rosuvastatin .
METHODS	All patients received rosuvastatin after surgery .
METHODS	We evaluated the incidence of myocardial necrosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events ( MACCE ) @ days and @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	Creatinine kinase-myocardial band ( CK-MB ) isoform elevations occurred less frequently @ and @ h after noncardiac emergency surgery in the experimental group than in the control group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	After surgery , the incidence of MACCE was also lower in the experimental group than in the control group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The difference was mainly due to the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable analysis found that rosuvastatin reload reduced the incidence of MACCE @ % @ months after surgery ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative rosuvastatin reload therapy decreases the incidence of myocardial necrosis and MACCE after noncardiac emergency surgery in patients with stable coronary artery disease on long-term statin therapy .

OBJECTIVE	In the present study , we investigated how the electrical activity in the sensorimotor cortex contributes to improved cognitive processing capabilities and how SMR ( sensorimotor rhythm , @-@Hz ) neurofeedback training modulates it .
OBJECTIVE	Previous evidence indicates that higher levels of SMR activity reduce sensorimotor interference and thereby promote cognitive processing .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to two groups , one experimental ( N = @ ) group receiving SMR neurofeedback training , in which they learned to voluntarily increase SMR , and one control group ( N = @ ) receiving sham feedback .
METHODS	Multiple cognitive functions and electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processing were assessed before and after @ neurofeedback training sessions .
RESULTS	The experimental group but not the control group showed linear increases in SMR power over training runs , which was associated with behavioural improvements in memory and attentional performance .
RESULTS	Additionally , increasing SMR led to a more salient stimulus processing as indicated by increased N@ and P@ event-related potential amplitudes after the training as compared to the pre-test .
RESULTS	Finally , functional brain connectivity between motor areas and visual processing areas was reduced after SMR training indicating reduced sensorimotor interference .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that SMR neurofeedback improves stimulus processing capabilities and consequently leads to improvements in cognitive performance .
CONCLUSIONS	The present findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying SMR neurofeedback training and cognitive processing and implicate that SMR neurofeedback might be an effective cognitive training tool .

BACKGROUND	We ( i ) described variability in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) test use across multiple levels , including physician , clinic , and neighborhood ; and ( ii ) compared the performance of novel cross-classified models versus traditional hierarchical models .
METHODS	We examined multilevel variation in CRC test use among patients not up-to-date with screening in a large , urban safety net health system ( @-@ ) .
METHODS	Outcomes included : ( i ) fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) or ( ii ) colonoscopy and were ascertained using claims data during a @-year follow-up .
METHODS	We compared Bayesian ( i ) cross-classified four-level logistic models nesting patients within separate , nonoverlapping `` levels '' ( physicians , clinics , and census tracts ) versus ( ii ) three hierarchical two-level models using deviance information criterion .
METHODS	Models were adjusted for covariates ( patient sociodemographic factors , driving time to clinic , and census tract poverty rate ) .
RESULTS	Of @,@ patients , @ ( @ % ) completed FOBT and @ ( @ % ) completed colonoscopy during the study year .
RESULTS	Patients attended @ clinics , saw @ physicians , and resided in @ census tracts .
RESULTS	Significant variability was observed across all levels in both hierarchical and cross-classified models that was unexplained by measured covariates .
RESULTS	For colonoscopy , variance was similar across all levels .
RESULTS	For FOBT , physicians , followed by clinics , demonstrated the largest variability .
RESULTS	Model fit using cross-classified models was superior or similar to @-level hierarchical models .
CONCLUSIONS	Significant and substantial variability was observed across neighborhood , physician , and clinic levels in CRC test use , suggesting the importance of factors at each of these levels on CRC testing .
CONCLUSIONS	Future multilevel research and intervention should consider the simultaneous influences of multiple levels , including clinic , physician , and neighborhood .

BACKGROUND	In-situ audiometry is a hearing aid feature that enables the measurement of hearing threshold levels through the hearing instrument using the built-in sound generator and the hearing aid receiver .
BACKGROUND	This feature can be used in hearing aid fittings instead of conventional pure-tone audiometry ( PTA ) , particularly in places where no standard audiometric equipment is available .
BACKGROUND	Differences between conventional and in-situ thresholds are described and discussed for some particular hearing aids .
BACKGROUND	No previous investigation has measured and compared these differences for a number of current hearing aid models by various manufacturers across a wide range of hearing losses .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to perform a model-based comparison of conventionally and in-situ measured hearing thresholds .
OBJECTIVE	Data were collected for a range of hearing aid devices to study and generalize the effects that may occur under clinical conditions .
METHODS	Research design was an experimental and regression study .
METHODS	A total of @ adults with sensorineural hearing loss served as test persons .
METHODS	They were assigned to three subgroups of @ subjects with mild ( M ) , moderate to severe ( MS ) , and severe ( S ) sensorineural hearing loss .
METHODS	All @ test persons underwent both conventional PTA and in-situ audiometry with four hearing aid models by various manufacturers .
METHODS	The differences between conventionally and in-situ measured hearing threshold levels were calculated and evaluated by an exploratory data analysis followed by a sophisticated statistical modeling process .
RESULTS	At @ and @ Hz , almost all threshold differences ( conventional PTA minus in-situ data ) were negative , i.e. , in the low to mid frequencies , hearing loss was overestimated by most devices relative to PTA .
RESULTS	At @ Hz , the majority of differences ( @ of @ ) were positive , i.e. , in the frequency range above @ Hz , hearing loss was frequently underestimated .
RESULTS	As hearing loss increased ( MMSS ) , the effect of the underestimation decreased .
RESULTS	At @ and @ Hz , Resound devices showed the smallest threshold deviations , followed by Phonak , Starkey , and Oticon instruments .
RESULTS	At @ Hz , this observed pattern partly disappeared and Starkey and Oticon devices showed a reversed effect with increasing hearing loss ( MMSS ) .
RESULTS	Because of high standard errors for the estimates , only a few explicit rankings of the devices could be established based on significant threshold differences ( @ % level ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Differences between conventional PTA and in-situ threshold levels may be attributed to ( @ ) frequency , ( @ ) device/hearing loss , and ( @ ) calibration/manufacturer effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Frequency effects primarily resulting in an overestimation of hearing loss by in-situ audiometry in the low and mid frequencies are mainly due to sound drain-off through vents and leaks .
CONCLUSIONS	Device/hearing loss effects may be due to leakage as well as boundary effects because in-situ audiometry is confined to a limited measurement range .
CONCLUSIONS	Finally , different calibration approaches may result in different offset levels between PTA and in-situ audiometry calibration .
CONCLUSIONS	In some cases , the observed threshold differences of up to @-@ dB may translate to varied hearing aid fittings for the same user depending on how hearing threshold levels were measured .

BACKGROUND	Adherence to medication is an issue of great importance for patients with ulcerative colitis .
BACKGROUND	Once daily mesalazine seems to be no worse than divided doses in preventing relapse in remitting patients .
BACKGROUND	Although this has been attributed to improved adherence , detailed measures of adherence have been lacking from previous studies .
METHODS	A @-year substudy was conducted alongside a trial that compared @ different dosing regimens ( once daily versus three times daily ) of mesalazine for patients in remission with ulcerative colitis .
METHODS	Participants in the substudy had their adherence monitored electronically using the medication event monitoring system , self-report , and tablet counts .
METHODS	We compared measures , determined factors associated with adherence and associations between adherence and relapse , modeled adherence over time , and explored behavioral aspects .
RESULTS	We included @ participants .
RESULTS	Adherence was high across all measures ( @ % self-report , @ % tablet counts , and @ % medication event monitoring system ) .
RESULTS	Agreement between the measures was poor at times .
RESULTS	Adherence according to the medication event monitoring system best distinguished between the participants who relapsed ( @ % ) and those who remained in remission ( @ % ) , although this difference was not statistically discernible at the @ % level .
RESULTS	Adherence deteriorated over the study period , with three times daily participants generally less adherent than once-daily participants ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Adherence was higher on weekdays ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) and around clinic visit dates ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Simple dosing regimens are preferable to multiple daily dosing regimens .
CONCLUSIONS	Electronic monitoring of adherence should be used more often in clinical studies .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-reported adherence and tablet counts may underestimate adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	Adherence declined over time , and adherence was generally lower and more varied for those allocated to the three times daily regimen .

BACKGROUND	The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with rectal cancer is controversial , especially when used after preoperative chemoradiotherapy .
BACKGROUND	Fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy , including fluorouracil and leucovorin , has been widely used ; however , the addition of oxaliplatin to fluorouracil and leucovorin ( FOLFOX ) , a standard adjuvant regimen for colon cancer , has not been tested in rectal cancer .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant fluorouracil and leucovorin with that of FOLFOX in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy .
METHODS	In this open-label , multicentre , phase @ , randomised trial , patients with postoperative pathological stage II ( ypT@-@N@ ) or III ( ypTanyN@-@ ) rectal cancer after preoperative fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision were recruited and randomly assigned ( @:@ ) via a web-based software platform to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with either four cycles of fluorouracil and leucovorin ( fluorouracil @ mg/m ( @ ) and leucovorin @ mg/m ( @ ) on days @-@ , every @ weeks ) or eight cycles of FOLFOX ( oxaliplatin @ mg/m ( @ ) , leucovorin @ mg/m ( @ ) , and fluorouracil bolus @ mg/m ( @ ) on day @ , and fluorouracil infusion @ mg/m ( @ ) for @ h , every @ weeks ) .
METHODS	Stratification factors were pathological stage ( II vs III ) and centre .
METHODS	Neither patients nor investigators were masked to group assignment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was @-year disease-free survival , analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	This study is fully enrolled , is in long-term follow-up , and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between Nov @ , @ , and June @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to fluorouracil and leucovorin ( n = @ ) and FOLFOX ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group and @ ( @ % ) of @ in the FOLFOX group completed all planned cycles of adjuvant treatment .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) .
RESULTS	@-year disease-free survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the FOLFOX group and @ % ( @-@ ) in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Any grade neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , fatigue , nausea , and sensory neuropathy were significantly more common in the FOLFOX group than in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group ; however , we noted no significant difference in the frequency of these events at grade @ or @ .
RESULTS	The most common grade @ or worse adverse events were neutropenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients in the FOLFOX group ) , leucopenia ( eight -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , febrile neutropenia ( four -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs one -LSB- < @ % -RSB- ) , diarrhoea ( four -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs two -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and nausea ( one -LSB- < @ % -RSB- vs two -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Adjuvant FOLFOX improves disease-free survival compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision , and warrants further investigation .

OBJECTIVE	Sweet esophagectomy is performed widely in China , while the Ivor-Lewis procedure , with potential benefit of an extended lymphadenectomy , is limitedly conducted owing to concern for a higher risk for morbidity .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , the role of the Ivor-Lewis procedure for thoracic esophageal cancer needs further investigation .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy is associated with increased postoperative complications compared with the Sweet procedure .
METHODS	A randomized clinical trial was conducted from May @ to July @ at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center , Shanghai , China , of @ patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma in the middle and lower third of the thoracic esophagus .
METHODS	Intent-to-treat analysis was performed .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the Ivor-Lewis ( n = @ ) or Sweet ( n = @ ) esophagectomy .
METHODS	The primary outcome of this clinical trial was operative morbidity ( any surgical or nonsurgical complications ) .

BACKGROUND	Hypotensive anesthesia is routinely used during craniosynostosis corrections to reduce blood loss .
BACKGROUND	Noting that cerebral oxygenation levels often fell below recommended levels , the authors sought to measure the effects of hypotensive versus standard anesthesia on blood transfusion rates .
METHODS	One hundred children undergoing craniosynostosis corrections were randomized prospectively into two groups : a target mean arterial pressure of either @ mm Hg or @ mm Hg .
METHODS	Aside from anesthesiologists , caregivers were blinded and strict transfusion criteria were followed .
METHODS	Multiple variables were analyzed , and appropriate statistical testing was performed .
RESULTS	The hypotensive and standard groups appeared similar , with no statistically significant differences in mean age ( @ months versus @ months ) , weight ( @ kg versus @ kg ) , procedure -LSB- anterior remodeling ( @ versus @ ) versus posterior ( @ versus @ ) -RSB- , or preoperative hemoglobin level ( @ g/dl versus @ g/dl ) .
RESULTS	Intraoperative mean arterial pressures differed significantly ( @ mm Hg versus @ mm Hg ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The captured cell saver amount was lower in the hypotensive group ( @ cc versus @ cc ; p = @ ) , yet no significant differences were noted in postoperative hemoglobin levels ( @ g/dl versus @ g/dl ) .
RESULTS	Fifteen of @ patients ( @ percent ) received allogenic transfusions , but no statistically significant differences were noted in transfusion rates between the hypotensive -LSB- nine of @ ( @ percent ) -RSB- and standard anesthesia -LSB- six of @ ( @ percent ) -RSB- group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	No significant difference in transfusion requirements was found between hypotensive and standard anesthesia during craniosynostosis corrections .
CONCLUSIONS	Considering potential benefits of improved cerebral blood flow and total body perfusion , surgeons might consider performing craniosynostosis corrections without hypotension .

OBJECTIVE	Sensorimotor rhythm patterns in patients with lower limb amputations might be altered because of reorganization of the sensorimotor cortices .
OBJECTIVE	The authors evaluated the sensorimotor rhythm of motor imagery ( MI ) in healthy subjects and patients with lower limb amputations .
OBJECTIVE	In addition , the authors investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) could modulate sensorimotor rhythm control .
METHODS	Six healthy subjects and six patients with lower limb amputations were assigned to receive anodal , cathodal , or sham tDCS over the foot motor area in a randomized order .
METHODS	The authors evaluated event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization ( ERS ) of unilateral hand and bilateral foot MI before and after tDCS .
RESULTS	Beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations was significantly lesser than that in healthy subjects .
RESULTS	Compared with sham stimulation , cathodal tDCS enhanced beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations .
RESULTS	In contrast , anodal tDCS decreased beta ERS of foot MI in healthy subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study to demonstrate that cathodal tDCS can enhance a weak beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings might contribute in improving the effectiveness of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain computer interface for gait restoration after lower limb amputation .

BACKGROUND	Inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-@-kinase / protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin ( PI@K/AKT/mTOR ) pathway can overcome endocrine resistance in estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive breast cancer , but companion diagnostics indicating PI@K/AKT/mTOR activation and consequently endocrine resistance are lacking .
BACKGROUND	PIK@CA mutations frequently occur in ER-positive breast cancer and result in PI@K/AKT/mTOR activation in vitro .
BACKGROUND	Nevertheless , the prognostic and treatment-predictive value of these mutations in ER-positive breast cancer is contradictive .
BACKGROUND	We tested the clinical validity of PIK@CA mutations and other canonic pathway drivers to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen .
BACKGROUND	In addition , we tested the association between these drivers and downstream activated proteins .
METHODS	Primary tumors from @ ER-positive postmenopausal patients , randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen ( @ to @ years ) versus observation were recollected .
METHODS	PIK@CA hotspot mutations in exon @ and exon @ were assessed with Sequenom Mass Spectometry .
METHODS	Immunohistochemistry was performed for human epidermal growth factor receptor @ ( HER@ ) , phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , and insulin-like growth factor @ receptor ( IGF-@R ) .
METHODS	We tested the association between these molecular alterations and downstream activated proteins ( like phospho-protein kinase B ( p-AKT ) , phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin ( p-mTOR ) , p-ERK@ / @ , and p-p@S@K ) .
METHODS	Recurrence-free interval improvement with tamoxifen versus control was assessed according to the presence or absence of canonic pathway drivers , by using Cox proportional hazard models , including a test for interaction .
RESULTS	PIK@CA mutations ( both exon @ and exon @ ) were associated with low tumor grade .
RESULTS	An enrichment of PIK@CA exon @ mutations was observed in progesterone receptor - positive tumors .
RESULTS	PIK@CA exon @ mutations were not associated with downstream-activated proteins .
RESULTS	No significant interaction between PIK@CA mutations or any of the other canonic pathway drivers and tamoxifen-treatment benefit was found .
CONCLUSIONS	PIK@CA mutations do not have clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen and may therefore be unsuitable as companion diagnostic for PI@K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in ER - positive , postmenopausal , early breast cancer patients .

BACKGROUND	Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint ( hallux rigidus ) leads to pain and poor function and mobility .
BACKGROUND	Arthrodesis is the gold standard treatment for end-stage disease .
BACKGROUND	Total joint arthroplasties have been attempted , but early loosening has been attributed to dorsally directed shear forces on the metatarsal component .
BACKGROUND	Metallic proximal phalangeal hemiarthroplasty theoretically avoids this .
BACKGROUND	Whilst early results are promising , no comparative trials exist comparing this to arthrodesis .
METHODS	The primary objectives are to determine the range of outcome scores between the two treatment arms ( to inform a power calculation ) .
METHODS	Outcome measures will include the MOXFQ , AOFAS-Hallux and EuroQol EQ-@D-@ L. Secondary objectives are to determine the accrual rate , dropout rate and trial acceptability to both patients and surgeons .
METHODS	These data will allow the development of a larger trial with longer follow-up .
METHODS	This is a prospective randomised controlled single-centre study comparing proximal phalanx hemiarthroplasty ( AnaToemic , Arthrex Ltd. , Sheffield , UK ) with arthrodesis ( @ patients in each arm ) .
METHODS	Randomisation will be performed using a @:@ allocation ratio in blocks of six.Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be recruited from three foot and ankle consultant surgeon 's clinics ( East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust ) .
METHODS	If agreeable , informed consent will be obtained before patients are randomised.The outcome measure scores will be completed pre-operatively and repeated at @ weeks , @ months and @ months .
METHODS	A radiological review will be performed at @ weeks and @ months to determine rates of loosening ( hemiarthroplasty ) and union ( arthrodesis ) .
METHODS	Data on length of stay , return to work , complications and re-operation rates will also be collected.The analysis will compare the change in outcome scores between treatment groups at all follow-up time points .
METHODS	Scores will be compared using a Student t-test , adjusting for scores at baseline.This study will be conducted in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki ( @ ) and the ICH-GCP Guideline ( International Conference on Harmonisation , Good Clinical Practice , E@ ( R@ ) , @ ) .
METHODS	This study has been approved by the sponsor , the Trust Research & Development office .

OBJECTIVE	Minimal sedation obviates patient recovery burdens , but intolerable pain limits success of cecal intubation .
OBJECTIVE	Painless or minimally uncomfortable insertion ensures success of cecal intubation , current patient satisfaction , and willingness to repeat future colonoscopy with minimal sedation .
OBJECTIVE	Water immersion ( WI ) and water exchange ( WE ) , when separately compared with air insufflation ( AI ) , significantly reduced insertion pain .
OBJECTIVE	To assess comparative effectiveness , we conducted a randomized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison of these three methods .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that WE could produce the highest proportion of patients reporting painless insertion .
METHODS	This prospective patient-blinded trial ( NCT@ ) enrolled minimally sedated ( @mg intramuscular meperidine ) patients randomized to AI , WI , or WE ( @ patients/group ) to aid insertion .
METHODS	The previously validated primary outcome was the proportion of patients reporting painless insertion .
RESULTS	Painless insertion was reported by @ % ( AI ) , @ % ( WI ) , and @ % ( WE ) of patients ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that , after adjusting for gender , body mass index , abdominal compression , position change , insertion time to cecum , and length of scope at cecum , only WE was significantly associated with painless insertion compared with AI ( odds ratio ( OR ) = @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @-@ @ , P < @ ) or WI ( OR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) in the right ( cecum and ascending ) colon was @ % ( AI ) , @ % ( WI ) , and @ % ( WE ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The limitations included single site study with unblinded colonoscopist and assistant .
CONCLUSIONS	This head-to-head comparison of AI vs. WI vs. WE confirmed that WE was superior to WI and AI , with a significantly greater proportion of patients reporting painless insertion .
CONCLUSIONS	The significantly higher ADR in the right colon in the WE group warrants further investigations .

BACKGROUND	One of the most common and severe complications affecting peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patients is exit-site infection of the peritoneal catheter ; it is therefore of vital importance to prevent it .
BACKGROUND	This complication has a negative impact on the success of the technique .
BACKGROUND	In spite of this , there are no clear guidelines concerning how to take care of the exit site .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of polyhexanide in preventing exit-site infection over a @-month period .
METHODS	We designed a single-center , prospective , open-labeled , randomized controlled clinical trial with parallel groups .
METHODS	Requirements for participation in the study included implantation of the peritoneal catheter at least six weeks before entering the study and no infectious complications requiring either hospital admission or antibiotic treatment for at least three months before entering into the study .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to be daily cured as follows : Group A : traditional care with saline serum and povidone-iodine ; and Group B : polyhexanide solution .
METHODS	Exit sites were evaluated at baseline and every four to six weeks or if any event occurred , according to the Twardowski criteria .
RESULTS	Of the @ included patients , @ completed the @-month follow-up period .
RESULTS	Six underwent transplantation , five died and three were transferred to hemodialysis ( HD ) .
RESULTS	The treatment was well tolerated , with no side effects nor abandonments due to such effects .
RESULTS	Throughout the study period , six patients ( @ % ) undergoing traditional care and only two ( @,@ % ) receiving polyhexanide developed an exit-site infection ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were a total number of @ infections ; nine occurred in patients following the traditional approach and only three in patients treated with polyhexanide ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The germs responsible for the infections were : S. aureus ( six cases ) , Corynebacterium jeikeium ( two cases ) and P. aeruginosa ( one case ) in the saline serum and povidone-iodine group and P. aeruginosa ( three cases ) in the polyhexanide group .
RESULTS	The mean rate of exit-site infection was @ episode/@ @ patient-months for the traditional care group and @ episode/@ @ patient-months for the polyhexanide group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients following the traditional treatment required fewer days to get infected than those using polyhexanide ( p = @ ; log rank : @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results show that using polyhexanide is efficient for the prevention of exit-site infections .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients treated with this product suffer from fewer infections and need more time to become infected .
CONCLUSIONS	Polyhexanide application is painless , no allergies have been described and it is well tolerated by patients .
CONCLUSIONS	We therefore propose that it may be used routinely from now on for the care of healthy exit site .

BACKGROUND	Periprocedural ( @ h pre - and @ h post-angiography ) hemofiltration appears to effectively prevent contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patients undergoing coronary angiography .
BACKGROUND	However , this procedure over-uses medical resources , and the cessation of hemofiltration during coronary angiography results in persistent renal injury .
BACKGROUND	In comparison , simultaneous hemofiltration performed only during coronary angiography requires fewer medical resources and can provide instantaneous protection against CIN .
METHODS	Sixty-eight CKD patients ( serum creatinine , @ mg/dL ) undergoing coronary angiography were randomized in a @:@ ratio to receive either periprocedural ( n = @ ) or simultaneous ( n = @ ) hemofiltration .
METHODS	The expected CIN rate was similar for the two groups ( @ % versus @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	On day @ after contrast exposure , four and seven patients in the periprocedural and simultaneous groups , respectively experienced CIN ( @ % versus @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	On days @-@ , seven and three patients in the periprocedural and simultaneous groups , respectively experienced CIN ( @ % versus @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The serum creatinine levels of patients in the periprocedural group transiently decreased on day @ and persistently increased during days @-@ compared with the simultaneous group .
RESULTS	This difference between the two groups in terms of creatinine levels over time was statistically significant ( F statistic = @ ; p = @ , by ANCOVA ) .
RESULTS	The cost of hemofiltration was doubled in the periprocedural group ( $ @ versus $ @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Simultaneous hemofiltration provide equal early ( day @ ) and better late-stage ( days @-@ ) renal protection against CIN at a significantly lower cost compared with periprocedural hemofiltration .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of electromagnetic tracking in assisting CT-guided liver biopsies .
METHODS	This was a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial comparing nonfluoroscopic CT-guided liver biopsy using an advance-and-scan technique with and without electromagnetic tracking .
METHODS	Fifty patients with a liver lesion referred for biopsy ( women , @ % ; mean age , @ years ; mean lesion size , @ cm ) were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to either arm .
METHODS	The primary and secondary objectives were to assess and quantify differences in the number of intraprocedural scans , cumulative effective radiation dose , number of needle manipulations , and procedure time from skin-stick to the target lesion with and without assistance .
RESULTS	Electromagnetic tracking significantly decreased the number of scans , effective radiation dose , number of manipulations per procedure , and time from skin-stick to the target lesion .
RESULTS	The ratio of the number of scans ( electromagnetic tracking to control ) was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean difference in effective radiation dose ( electromagnetic tracking-control ) was -@ mSv ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ mSv ; p = @ ) , and the median difference was -@ mSv ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ mSv ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The ratio of the number of manipulations ( electromagnetic tracking to control ) was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean difference for the time from skin-stick to the target lesion was -@ seconds ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ seconds ; p = @ ) and the median difference was -@ seconds ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ seconds ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Electromagnetic tracking assistance has the potential to decrease the number of intraprocedural CT scans and needle manipulations and to reduce patient radiation dose during CT-guided liver biopsy .

OBJECTIVE	This report from the LEADER ( Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes : Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results ) trial describes baseline lipase and amylase activity in type @ diabetic subjects without acute pancreatitis symptoms before randomization to the glucagonlike peptide analog liraglutide or placebo .
METHODS	The LEADER is an international randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide in @ type @ diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk .
METHODS	Fasting lipase and amylase activity was assessed at baseline , before receiving liraglutide or placebo , using a commercial assay ( Roche ) with upper limit of normal values of @ U/L for lipase and @ U/L for amylase .
RESULTS	Either or both enzymes were above the upper limit of normal in @ % of subjects ; @ % ( n = @ ) had an elevated lipase level ( including @ % > @-fold elevated ) , and @ % ( n = @ ) had an elevated amylase level ( including @ % > @-fold elevated ) .
RESULTS	In multivariable regression models , severely reduced kidney function was associated with the largest effect on increasing activity of both .
RESULTS	However , even among subjects with normal kidney function , @ % and @ % had elevated lipase and amylase levels .
CONCLUSIONS	In this large study of type @ diabetic patients , nearly @ % had elevated lipase or amylase levels without symptoms of acute pancreatitis .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinician must take these data into account when evaluating abdominal symptoms in type @ diabetic patients .

BACKGROUND	Exacerbations of bronchial asthma usually occur in the autumn .
BACKGROUND	To our knowledge , however , the effectiveness of drugs for preventing exacerbations of asthma in the autumn has not been studied previously , except for leukotriene receptor antagonists and Omalizmab .
METHODS	This study compared the prophylactic effectiveness of suplatast tosilate with that of mequitazine in children with asthma symptoms , which is usually exacerbated in the autumn .
METHODS	The study group comprised @ children aged @ to @ years who required treatment for asthmatic attacks during the past year and tested positive at least for mite allergen in the preceding autumn .
METHODS	The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either suplatast or mequitazine .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of this study was the number of days without symptoms during the @ weeks of treatment .
METHODS	In addition , the Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program ( JPAC ) scores were also recorded every @ weeks in each group .
RESULTS	Overall , @ patients received suplatast , and @ received mequitazine for @ weeks from September through early October .
RESULTS	During follow-up , the number of days without symptoms and the total JPAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups .
RESULTS	However , as compared with weeks @ to @ of treatment , the mean number of days without symptoms during weeks @ to @ increased significantly in only the suplatast group ( @ vs. @ days ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that short-term additional treatment with suplatast is useful for preventing asthma symptoms in children with asthma , which is usually exacerbated in the autumn .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this prospective randomized controlled cross sectional study was to evaluate the effect of a six month tibolone treatment in healthy postmenopausal women on biochemical CVD markers by calculating the changes of the blood serum levels of total cholesterol ( TC ) , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , triglycerides ( Tg ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , homocysteine ( Hcy ) , and endothelin-@ ( ET-@ ) at the beginning of the treatment and after six months .
METHODS	Fifty-two healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , case-controlled outpatient trial .
METHODS	Group @ ( n = @ ) received @,@ mg/d tibolone for six months , while Group @ ( n = @ ) received no treatment .
METHODS	Serum levels ofTC , LDL , HDL , Tg , hsCRP , Hcy , and ET-@ were evaluated at baseline and after six months .
RESULTS	The two groups did not statistically differ at baseline characteristics .
RESULTS	In Group @ tibolone treatment decreased significantly TC ( p = @ ) , HDL ( p < @ ) , and Tg ( p < @ ) serum levels while a significant increase ofhsCRP ( p < @ ) was observed .
RESULTS	Finally no changes were noticed on LDL , Hcy , and ET-@ serum levels .
RESULTS	Regarding Group @ , no changes were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-term tibolone treatment in healthy postmenopausal women exerts a mixed action , acting beneficially in some markers ( TC , LDL , Tg , Hcy , and ET-@ ) where as detrimentally in others ( HDL , hsCRP ) .

BACKGROUND	Few previous studies have examined the influence of instrumental and emotional social support on physical activity ( PA ) longitudinally in underserved adolescents .
OBJECTIVE	This longitudinal study was a secondary analysis of the Active by Choice Today ( ACT ) trial examining whether instrumental social support predicts increases in PA in underserved adolescents , above and beyond emotional social support provided by family or peers .
METHODS	Students in the sixth grade ( N = @,@ , @ % African American , @ % female , M age = @years ) in the ACT trial participated .
METHODS	At baseline and @weeks , previously validated measures of social support ( family instrumental , family emotional , and peer emotional ) were completed and moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA ) was assessed using @-day accelerometry estimates .
RESULTS	A mixed ANCOVA demonstrated that baseline ( p = @ ) and change in family instrumental support ( p = @ ) , but not emotional support from family or peers , predicted increases in MVPA across a @-week period .
CONCLUSIONS	Future interventions in underserved adolescents should enhance opportunities for instrumental support for PA. .

###26069138
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to determine whether head elevation during combined spinal-epidural anesthesia ( CSE ) and Caesarean section provided improved hemodynamics and appropriate sensory block height .
METHODS	Forty-four parous women undergoing CSE for elective Caesarean section were randomly assigned to one of two groups : right lateral ( group L ) or right lateral and head elevated ( group HE ) position , for insertion of the block .
METHODS	Patients were positioned in the supine wedged position ( group L ) or the left lateral and head elevated position ( group HE ) until a block height of T@ to light touch was reached .
METHODS	Group HE was then turned to the supine wedged position with maintenance of head elevation until the end of surgery .
METHODS	Hemodynamics , including the incidence of hypotension , ephedrine dose required , and characteristics of the sensory blocks were analyzed .
RESULTS	The incidence of hypotension ( @ versus @ , p = @ ) and the required dose of ephedrine -LSB- @ ( @-@ ) versus @ ( @-@ ) , p < @ -RSB- were greater in group L compared to group HE .
RESULTS	In group L , the time to achieve maximal sensory block level ( MSBL ) was shorter ( @ min versus @ min , p < @ ) and MSBL was also higher than in group HE -LSB- @ ( T@ ) versus @ ( T@ ) , p = @ -RSB- .
CONCLUSIONS	Head elevation during CSE and Caesarean section is superior to positioning without head elevation in the lateral to supine position , as it is associated with a more gradual onset , appropriate block height , and improved hemodynamics .

BACKGROUND	Self-monitoring is reported to have limited efficacy for hypertension management in high-income countries .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we aimed to evaluate the effect of self-monitoring on blood pressure ( BP ) control in an Iranian population .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial was conducted on @ mild to moderate hypertensive patients in an outpatient cardiovascular clinic .
METHODS	Patients in the intervention group received a wrist self-monitoring device and were educated to measure and document their BP daily during the study period ( @ weeks ) .
METHODS	Patients in the control group received usual care .
METHODS	Three follow-up visits with the physician were scheduled for all patients ( weeks @ , @ , and @ ) , and the investigator assessed adherence to medications after each visit ( pill counting ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome ( BP ) was compared between groups using repeated-measure analysis of variance .
RESULTS	One hundred ninety patients completed the study .
RESULTS	Systolic BP ( @ vs @ mm Hg ) and diastolic BP ( @ vs. @ mm Hg ) were similar between groups at baseline .
RESULTS	The trend of BP was not significantly different between groups during the study period .
RESULTS	Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly in both groups at the first follow-up visit ( systolic BP : @ vs. @ mm Hg ; diastolic BP : @ vs. @ mm Hg ) .
RESULTS	In the intervention group , we observed a small continued decrease in diastolic BP up to week @ BP ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both groups showed adherence rates > @ % during the study period .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study could not confirm that self-monitoring can improve BP control in patients with frequent medical visits .

###24947928
OBJECTIVE	To explore in a panel of patient-derived xenograft models of human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whether high EGFR expression , was associated with cetuximab activity .
METHODS	NSCLC patient-derived xenograft models ( n = @ ) were implanted subcutaneously into panels of nude mice and randomization cohorts were treated with either cetuximab , cisplatin , cisplatin plus cetuximab , vehicle control , or else were left untreated .
METHODS	Responses according to treatment were assessed at week @ by analyzing the relative change in tumor volume and an experimental analogue of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guidelines .
METHODS	An EGFR IHC score was calculated for each patient-derived xenograft model and response was assessed according to EGFR expression level .
RESULTS	When tumors were stratified into high and low EGFR expression groups ( IHC score threshold @ ; scale @-@ ) , a stronger antitumor activity was seen in the high EGFR expression group compared with the low EGFR expression group in both the cetuximab monotherapy and cisplatin plus cetuximab combination therapy settings .
RESULTS	For tumors treated with cisplatin plus cetuximab , the objective response rate was significantly higher in the high EGFR expression group compared with the low EGFR expression group ( @ % vs. @ % ) .
RESULTS	Objective response rates were similar in high and low expression groups for tumors treated with cisplatin alone ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Cetuximab activity in NSCLC patient-derived xenograft models was demonstrated clearly only in tumors that expressed high levels of EGFR , as defined by an IHC score of @ .

OBJECTIVE	Resorbable fixation material is an attractive option for those patients undergoing orthognathic surgery .
OBJECTIVE	The efficacy of resorbable screws was tested in bilateral mandibular sagittal split osteotomies ( BSSOs ) performed for correction of retrognathic mandibles .
METHODS	One hundred one patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Patients in group @ ( n = @ ) received titanium screws ( Stryker ) and patients in group @ ( n = @ ) received resorbable screws ( Inion CPS ) .
METHODS	Outcome measurements were compared for statistical significance .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant difference in the use of postoperative elastics ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in other outcome measurements , including clinical evidence of relapse .
CONCLUSIONS	Resorbable screws can be used effectively for fixation of BSSO for mandibular advancement .
CONCLUSIONS	A higher incidence of rotation around positional screws can result secondary to the mechanical `` looseness '' when using resorbable screws .
CONCLUSIONS	This can be treated effectively using Class III mechanic elastics during the initial stages of bone healing .

###25005339
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether exclusion of infection and antibiotic stewardship with the infection biomarker procalcitonin improves outcomes in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patients presenting to emergency departments with respiratory symptoms and suspicion of respiratory infection .
METHODS	We performed a secondary analysis of patients with a past medical history of CHF formerly included in a Swiss multicenter randomized-controlled trial .
METHODS	The trial compared antibiotic stewardship according to a procalcitonin algorithm or state-of-the-art guidelines ( controls ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was a @-day adverse outcome ( death , intensive care unit admission ) ; the secondary endpoints included a @-day antibiotic exposure .
RESULTS	In the @/@ analyzed patients ( @ % ) with low initial procalcitonin ( < @ g/L ) , suggesting the absence of systemic bacterial infection , those randomized to procalcitonin guidance ( n = @ ) had a significantly lower adverse outcome rate compared to controls ( n = @ ) : @ % vs. @ % ( absolute difference -@ % , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ % to -@ % , P = @ ) , and significantly reduced antibiotic exposure -LSB- days -RSB- ( mean @ @ vs. @ @ , difference -@ -LSB- @ % CI , -@ to -@ -RSB- , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	When initial procalcitonin was @ g/L , procalcitonin-guided patients had significantly reduced antibiotic exposure due to early stop of therapy without any difference in adverse outcomes ( @ % vs. @ % , difference -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- @ % -LSB- -@ % to @ % , P = @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CHF patients presenting to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and suspicion for respiratory infection had decreased antibiotic exposure and improved outcomes when procalcitonin measurement was used to exclude bacterial infection and guide antibiotic treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	These data provide further evidence for the potential harmful effects of antibiotic / fluid treatment when used instead of diuretics and heart failure medication in clinically symptomatic CHF patients without underlying infection .

BACKGROUND	Children surviving acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) are at increased risk for overweight and obesity over that of the general population .
BACKGROUND	Whether a generic or tailored approach to weight management is needed for cancer survivors has yet to be tested .
METHODS	Thirty-eight youth @-@ years with BMI @ % who had survived ALL were recruited for a randomized clinical trial evaluating a weight management intervention ( WMI ) tailored for childhood ALL survivors ( Fit@Life ) .
METHODS	Fit@Life recipients received a @-month web , phone , and text message-delivered WMI tailored for cancer survivorship .
METHODS	Controls received a general WMI delivered via phone and mail .
METHODS	Assessments were performed at baseline and @ months .
METHODS	Outcome data were analyzed according to assigned treatment condition over time .
RESULTS	Most ( @ % , ( @ % , @ % ) -LSB- median ( IQR ) -RSB- ) of the assigned curriculum was received by Fit@Life participants as compared to @ % ( @ % , @ % ) among controls .
RESULTS	Fit@Life recipients @ years demonstrated less weight gain ( P = @ ) and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( P < @ ) while all Fit@Life recipients reported reduced negative mood ( P < @ ) over time as compared to control counterparts .
CONCLUSIONS	We demonstrated acceptable feasibility of a WMI tailored for overweight and obese children surviving ALL utilizing a multimodal technology approach .
CONCLUSIONS	Improved weight , weight-related behavior , and psychological outcomes were demonstrated among Fit@Life intervention as compared to youth receiving a generic WMI .
CONCLUSIONS	Data from this pilot trial may be used to design a larger trial to determine whether youth of all ages also can derive a benefit from a cancer survivor-tailored WMI and whether short-term outcomes translate into improved long-term outcomes for childhood ALL survivors .

###24404819
OBJECTIVE	Patient self-management support may be augmented by using home-based technologies that generate data points that providers can potentially use to make more timely changes in the patients ' care .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term targeted use of remote data transmission on treatment outcomes in patients with diabetes who had either out-of-range hemoglobin A@c ( A@c ) and/or blood pressure ( BP ) measurements .
METHODS	A single-center randomized controlled clinical trial design compared in-home monitoring ( n = @ ) and usual care ( n = @ ) in patients with type @ diabetes and hypertension being treated in primary care clinics .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were A@c and systolic BP after a @-week intervention .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups on either A@c or systolic BP following the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of technology alone is unlikely to lead to improvements in outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Practices need to be selective in their use of telemonitoring with patients , limiting it to patients who have motivation or a significant change in care , such as starting insulin .
CONCLUSIONS	Attention to the need for effective and responsive clinic processes to optimize the use of the additional data is also important when implementing these types of technology .

BACKGROUND	It is empirically well documented that psychotherapy is vital in the treatment of chronic back pain .
OBJECTIVE	To test in this randomized controlled clinical trial whether cognitive behavior group therapy is effective in respect to pain tolerance and disability apart from the effects on somatization in general and additional to the effects of a multimodal inpatient orthopedic rehabilitation programme .
METHODS	Fifty-three patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group , receiving six sessions of `` cognitive behavior group therapy for back pain '' ( CBT-BP ) , and @ to a control group who got unspecific occupational therapy sessions instead .
METHODS	Patients were suffering from chronic back pain for at least six months .
METHODS	All patients were treated for @ days in an orthopedic inpatient rehabilitation unit with a multimodal orthopedic treatment , including active physical therapy , patient education or motivation to exercise .
RESULTS	In both groups there is a significant improvement over time in the Symptom Checklist ( SCL-@ ) , the Rating of Health Locus of Control Attributions , the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ( FABQS ) and a Visual Analogue Pain Scale ( VAS-pain ) .
RESULTS	There are significant interactions between treatment group and VAS-pain and the FABQS , showing a superior improvement in the intervention group , while no significant superiority is found for the SCL .
CONCLUSIONS	The experience of pain can be altered directly and not only through improvement of depression or general somatoform complaints .
CONCLUSIONS	The study replicates other research and increases the evidence base for this mode of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The treatment effect can be called specific as it is found additional to a multimodal inpatient care programme .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether the @-year change in lens opacity severity on the Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) lens grading scale predicts progression to cataract surgery or loss of visual acuity by @ years .
METHODS	Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial of oral supplements .
METHODS	The AREDS participants whose eyes were phakic at baseline and free of late age-related macular degeneration throughout the study .
METHODS	Baseline and annual lens photographs of AREDS participants ( n = @/@ ; @ % ) were graded for severity of cataracts using the AREDS system for classifying cataracts from photographs .
METHODS	Clinical examinations conducted semiannually collected data on cataract surgery and visual acuity .
METHODS	Association of the change in lens opacities at @ years with these outcomes at @ years was analyzed with adjusted Cox proportional hazard models .
METHODS	Progression of lens opacities on stereoscopic lens photographs at @ years , cataract surgery , and visual acuity loss of @ lines or more at @ years .
RESULTS	The adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) for association of progression to cataract surgery at @ years were : nuclear cataract increase of @ unit or more compared with less than @-unit change at @ years , @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) ; cortical cataract increase of @ % or more in lens opacity in the central @ mm of the lens compared with less than @ % increase at @ years , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) ; and posterior subcapsular cataract increase of @ % or more versus less than @ % in the central @ mm of the lens , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , HRs of vision loss of @ lines or more at @ years for this degree of lens changes at @ years were the following : nuclear , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) ; cortical , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) ; and posterior subcapsular cataract , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Two-year changes in severity of lens opacities on the AREDS lens grading scale are predictive of long-term clinically relevant outcomes , making them potential surrogate end points in follow-up studies .

OBJECTIVE	Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) inhibit activated hepatic stellate cell contraction and are thought to reduce the dynamic portion of intrahepatic resistance .
OBJECTIVE	This study compared the effects of combined treatment using the ARB candesartan and propranolol versus propranolol monotherapy on portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis in a prospective , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Between January @ and July @ , @ cirrhotic patients with clinically significant portal hypertension were randomized to receive either candesartan and propranolol combination therapy ( @ patients ) or propranolol monotherapy ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	Before and @ months after the administration of the planned medication , the hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) was assessed in both groups .
METHODS	The dose of propranolol was subsequently increased from @ mg bid until the target heart rate was reached , and the candesartan dose was fixed at @ mg qd .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the HVPG response rate ; patients with an HVPG reduction of > @ % of the baseline value or to < @ mmHg were defined as responders .
RESULTS	The mean portal pressure declined significantly in both groups , from @ mmHg ( range , @-@ mmHg ) to @ mmHg ( range , @-@ mmHg ) in the combination group ( P < @ ) , and from @ mmHg ( range , @-@ mmHg ) to @ mmHg ( range , @-@ mmHg ) in the propranolol monotherapy group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the medication-induced pressure reduction did not differ significantly between the two groups -LSB- @ mmHg ( range , -@ -@ mmHg ) vs. @ mmHg ( range , -@ -@ mmHg ) , P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	The response rate ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) and the reductions in mean blood pressure or heart rate also did not differ significantly between the combination and monotherapy groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of candesartan ( an ARB ) to propranolol confers no benefit relative to classical propranolol monotherapy for the treatment of portal hypertension , and is thus not recommended .

METHODS	Blueberries are a rich source of flavonoids and phenolic acids .
METHODS	Currently , little information is available regarding the impact of processing on the bioavailability and the bioactivity of blueberry ( poly ) phenols .
RESULTS	In a randomized , controlled crossover trial , ten healthy volunteers consumed ( a ) blueberry-containing baked products , ( b ) an unprocessed blueberry drink containing the same amount of freeze-dried blueberry powder as used in the baked products , and ( c ) matched control baked products .
RESULTS	Endothelial function was measured as flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) and plasma samples taken at baseline and at @ , @ , @ , and @ h postconsumption .
RESULTS	Although processing did not significantly change the total ( poly ) phenolic amount , the processed products contained significantly less anthocyanins ( -@ % ) , more chlorogenic acid ( @ % ) , no flavanol nonamers or decamers , and significantly more flavanol dimers and trimers ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
RESULTS	FMD increased after @ , @ , and @ h consumption of the baked products to a similar degree as the unprocessed blueberries , despite significant differences in the levels of individual plasma metabolites .
RESULTS	No changes were observed after the consumption of the control product .
CONCLUSIONS	Careful processing can preserve important biological activities of blueberries despite changing the blueberry ( poly ) phenol composition and plasma metabolite profile .

OBJECTIVE	The current study assessed relations among maternal depressive symptoms , poorer youth diabetes adherence , and glycemic control .
OBJECTIVE	Specifically , hypothesized mediating links of lowered expectations of parental involvement , less parental monitoring , and more conflict were examined .
METHODS	Participants included @ mothers and their young adolescents , aged @-@ years ( M = @ years , SD = @ ) diagnosed with T@D .
METHODS	Maternal depressive symptoms and outcome expectancies for maternal involvement were evaluated with self-report questionnaires .
METHODS	Multisource , parent/youth , and multimethod assessment of adherence , parental monitoring , and conflict were evaluated during a baseline assessment from a larger randomized clinical trial .
RESULTS	The first hypothesized structural equation model demonstrated a good fit and indicated that more maternal depressive symptoms were directly associated with less parental monitoring and more conflict , which in turn each were associated with poorer adherence and glycemic control .
RESULTS	Although higher involvement expectancies were associated with more monitoring and less conflict , they were not associated with other model variables .
RESULTS	A second alternative model also fit the data well ; poorer youth adherence was associated with more conflict that in turn related to maternal depressive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Two models were tested by which maternal depressive symptoms and poorer youth adherence were interrelated via less monitoring and more conflict .
CONCLUSIONS	Follow-up longitudinal evaluation can best characterize the full extent of these relations .

OBJECTIVE	Digital plain radiographs of the pelvis are frequently performed in follow-up examinations of patients who received total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) or osteosynthesis ( OS ) .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , the purpose was to reduce the radiation dose and to determine objective quality control criteria to ensure accurate assessment .
METHODS	Institutional review board approval was obtained .
METHODS	In this prospective randomized study , @ patients underwent X-ray examination of the pelvis as follow up after receiving THA or OS with standard and reduced dose .
METHODS	The evaluation of the plain radiographs was conducted using the following criteria : bone-implant interface , implant-implant discrimination , implant-surface character and periarticular heterotopic ossification .
METHODS	Two radiologists evaluated these criteria using a score ranging from @ ( definitely assessable ) to @ ( not assessable ) .
METHODS	If a single criterion had been evaluated with a score of @ or more or more than @ criteria with @ points , the radiograph was scored as `` not assessable '' .
METHODS	The study was designed as non-inferiority-trial .
RESULTS	Seven ( @ % ) examined X-rays were scored as not assessable .
RESULTS	There was no statistical inferiority between the examinations with standard ( @ mSv ) or reduced dose ( @ mSv ) .
RESULTS	Reduced dose only led to limitations in the evaluation of ceramic components with low clinical impact in most scenarios .
CONCLUSIONS	Plain radiography of the pelvis in patients with THA or OS can be performed with a dose reduction of about @ % without a loss of important information .
CONCLUSIONS	The obtained quality control criteria were clinically applicable .

OBJECTIVE	The genetic , pharmacological and biochemical differences between ketamine responders and non-responders have not been identified .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to employ a metabolomics approach , a global , non-targeted determination of endogenous metabolic patterns , to identify potential markers of ketamine response and non-response .
METHODS	Plasma samples from @ BD patients were analyzed to produce metabolomic patterns .
METHODS	The patients had received ketamine in a placebo-controlled crossover study and the samples were obtained @min post-administration at which time the patients were categorized as responders or non-responders .
METHODS	Matching plasma samples from the placebo arm of the study were also analysed .
METHODS	During the study , the patients were maintained on either lithium or valproate .
RESULTS	The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate , irrespective of response to ketamine .
RESULTS	In the patients maintained on lithium , @ biomarkers were identified .
RESULTS	In responders , lysophosphatidylethanolamines ( @ ) and lysophosphatidylcholines ( @ ) were increased relative to non-responders .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial - oxidation of fatty acids .
CONCLUSIONS	These differences were not produced by ketamine administration .
CONCLUSIONS	The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy .

BACKGROUND	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is associated with heightened mortality due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
BACKGROUND	Inflammatory pathways in RA negatively affect vascular physiology and promote metabolic disturbances that contribute to CVD .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor - ( PPAR - ) pioglitazone could promote potent vasculoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in RA .
RESULTS	One hundred forty-three non-diabetic adult RA patients ( @ % female , age @ @ -LSB- mean SD -RSB- ) on stable RA standard of care treatment were enrolled in a randomized , double-blind placebo controlled crossover trial of @ mg daily pioglitazone versus placebo , with a @-month duration/arm and a @-month washout period .
RESULTS	Pulse wave velocity of the aorta ( PWV ) , brachial artery flow mediated dilatation ( FMD ) , nitroglycerin mediated dilatation ( NMD ) , microvascular endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index -LSB- RHI -RSB- ) , and circulating biomarkers of inflammation , insulin resistance , and atherosclerosis risk all were quantified .
RESULTS	RA disease activity was assessed with the @-Joint Count Disease Activity Score ( DAS-@ ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and the Short Form ( @ ) Health Survey quality of life questionnaire .
RESULTS	When added to standard of care RA treatment , pioglitazone significantly decreased pulse wave velocity ( ie , aortic stiffness ) ( P = @ ) , while FMD and RHI remained unchanged when compared to treatment with placebo .
RESULTS	Further , pioglitazone significantly reduced RA disease activity ( P = @ ) and CRP levels ( P = @ ) , while improving lipid profiles .
RESULTS	The drug was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of pioglitazone to RA standard of care significantly improves aortic elasticity and decreases inflammation and disease activity with minimal safety issues .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinical implications of these findings remain to be established .

OBJECTIVE	The relation between inflammatory markers , adiposity and disease is under extensive study .
OBJECTIVE	Here we tested the hypothesis that the immunomodulatory protein pentraxin @ ( PTX@ ) is associated with adiposity in the general population .
METHODS	Serum PTX@ concentrations , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference ( WC ) and fat depots , as quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging , were assessed in three community-based cohorts : ULSAM , n = @ , mean age @ years ; PIVUS , n = @ , mean age @ years , women @ % ; and the NORDIET-trial , n = @ , mean age @ years , women @ % .
METHODS	Participants were re-examined after @ years ( PIVUS , n = @ ) or following a @-week randomized controlled dietary intervention ( NORDIET ) .
RESULTS	PTX@ levels were inversely associated with BMI and WC as well as with total and visceral fat ( P < @ for all ; adjusted for age , inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors ) .
RESULTS	The association between PTX@ and BMI appeared even stronger in nonobese individuals .
RESULTS	A decrease in BMI over @ years as well as weight loss following the NORDIET intervention were associated with increased serum PTX@ concentrations ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These consistent data support an inverse association between circulating PTX@ and anthropometrical measures , calling for further mechanistic studies of the link between PTX@ and fat .

BACKGROUND	Low colo-rectal anastomoses have a relevant risk of leakage .
BACKGROUND	The protective stomas ( ileostomy or colostomy ) have always been utilized to reduce the complications due to anastomotic leakage .
BACKGROUND	The stoma not only causes relevant morbidity but also needs a second operation to be closed , with an added risk of complications .
OBJECTIVE	For this reason we planed and carried out a temporary percutaneous ileostomy by a jejunal probe introduced in the distal ileum , that can be removed without a surgical procedure and with negligible complications .
METHODS	The ALPPI trial is a randomized controlled , open , parallel , equivalence multicenter study .
METHODS	Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or laparotomic surgery for rectal cancer with extraperitoneal anastomosis , will be randomly allocated to undergo either lateral ileostomy or percutaneous ileostomy by exclusion probe .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint is the protection of the extraperitoneal colo-rectal anastomosis in terms of incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic anastomotic leakages .
RESULTS	The secondary endpoints are the evaluation of complications due to the placement and the removal of the exclusion probe for percutaneous ileostomy .
CONCLUSIONS	The ALPPI trial is designed to provide the surgical community with an evidence based new technique in the protection of low colo-rectal anastomosis , alternative to the conventional stomas .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the short-term efficacy of agents containing KNO@ or casein phosphopeptide - amorphous calcium phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity .
METHODS	UltraEZ , containing KNO@ and MI Paste , containing CPP-ACP were applied in this study .
METHODS	The dentin hypersensitivity of @ subjects was established by a tactile stimulus with a Yeaple preasure probe , and the degree of hypersensitivity was measured using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	The patients were divided into four groups : A , B , C and D , using a random number table .
METHODS	UltraEZ , a placebo of UltraEZ , MI Paste , and a placebo of MI Paste were applied to group A , B , C and D respectively for @ weeks .
METHODS	Dentin hypersensitivity was measured using VAS before the treatment ( baseline ) , on day @ , @ , and @ during the treatment , and on day @ and @ posttreatment .
RESULTS	The efficacy of UltraEZ on dentin hypersensitivity was significantly better than that of the corresponding placebo group on day @ during the treatment , whereas the efficacy of MI Paste exhibited better than that of the placebo group on day @ during the treatment .
RESULTS	However , there were no differences between the efficacy of the two agents on day @ during the treatment , day @ or day @ posttreatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Both UltraEZ and MI Paste had a significant effect on dentin hypersensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	UltraEZ showed quicker effects than MI Paste , but MI Paste had a greater sustained action after treatment than UltraEZ .

OBJECTIVE	This prospective randomized study compared acute and chronic anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction using ligament advanced reinforcement system ( LARS ) artificial ligament in young active adults with a @-year follow-up .
METHODS	Fifty-five patients were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups based on the elapsed time between the injury and reconstruction : the acute group ( @-@ weeks ) and the chronic group ( @-@ months ) .
METHODS	The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm knee scoring scale , the Tegner activity rating , a KT-@ Arthrometer , and the International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) scoring system .
METHODS	Isokinetic strength of the quadriceps and hamstring was assessed using the Biodex System @ isokinetic dynamometer .
RESULTS	Anterior laxity was decreased and quadriceps/hamstring muscle strength was increased in the acute group compared to the chronic group ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm scores , Tegner activity scores , and the IKDC evaluation form between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that earlier ACL reconstruction using a LARS artificial ligament may provide an advantage in the treatment and rehabilitation of ACL rupture .

BACKGROUND	The protein leverage hypothesis requires specific evidence that protein intake is regulated more strongly than energy intake .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to determine ad libitum energy intake , body weight changes , appetite profile , and nitrogen balance in response to @ diets with different protein-to-carbohydrate + fat ratios over @ consecutive days , with beef as a source of protein .
METHODS	A @-arm , @-d randomized crossover study was performed in @ men and @ women -LSB- mean SD age : @ @ y ; body mass index ( in kg/m ) : @ @ -RSB- with the use of diets containing @ % , @ % , and @ % of energy ( En % ) from protein , predominantly from beef .
RESULTS	Energy intake was significantly lower in the @En % - protein condition ( @ @ MJ/d ) than in the @En % - protein ( @ @ MJ/d ) and @En % - protein ( @ @ MJ/d ) conditions ( P = @ ) , stemming largely from lower energy intake during meals ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hunger ( P = @ ) and desire to eat ( P = @ ) ratings were higher and fullness ratings were lower ( P = @ ) in the @En % - protein condition than in the @En % - protein and @En % - protein conditions .
RESULTS	Nitrogen excretion was lower in the @En % - protein condition ( @ @ g/@ h ; P = @ ) and was higher in the @En % - protein condition ( @ @ g/@ h ; P = @ ) compared with the @En % - protein condition ( @ @ g/@ h ) .
RESULTS	Nitrogen balance was maintained in the @En % - protein condition and was positive in the @En % - and @En % - protein conditions ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Complete protein leverage did not occur because subjects did not consume to a common protein amount at the expense of energy balance .
CONCLUSIONS	Individuals did underconsume relative to energy requirements from high-protein diets .
CONCLUSIONS	The lack of support for protein leverage effects on a low-protein diet may stem from the fact that protein intake was sufficient to maintain nitrogen balance over the @-d trial .

OBJECTIVE	To compare hyperfractionation versus standard fractionation for T@N@ vocal cord carcinoma in a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Patients with T@ vocal cord cancer were stratified by substage ( T@a vs T@b ) and randomly assigned to receive either hyperfractionation ( HFX ) to @ Gy in @ fractions of @ Gy given twice a day , or standard fractionation ( SFX ) to @ Gy in @ fractions given once a day .
METHODS	The trial was designed to detect a @ % reduction in the local failure hazard rate with @ % statistical power .
RESULTS	Between April @ and July @ , a total of @ patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	Of @ patients analyzable for outcomes , @ % were male , @ % had a Karnofsky performance status of @-@ , and @ % had T@a tumor .
RESULTS	Median follow-up for all surviving patients was @ years ( range , @-@ @ years ) .
RESULTS	The @-year local control ( LC ) rate was @ points higher but not statistically significant ( P = @ for HFX -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs SFX -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , corresponding to a @ % hazard rate reduction .
RESULTS	The @-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) was @ % versus @ % ( P = @ ) and overall survival ( OS ) was @ % versus @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	HFX was associated with higher rates of acute skin , mucosal , and laryngeal toxicity .
RESULTS	Grade @-@ late effects were similar with a @-year cumulative incidence of @ % ( @ % -@ % ) after SFX and @ % ( @ % -@ % ) after HFX .
CONCLUSIONS	The @-year local control was modestly higher with HFX compared to SFX for T@ glottic carcinoma , but the difference was not statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	These results are consistent with prior studies of hyperfractionation showing a benefit in local control .
CONCLUSIONS	Substaging by T@a versus T@b carries prognostic value for DFS and OS .
CONCLUSIONS	For cost and convenience reasons other altered fractionation schedules have been adopted in routine practice .

BACKGROUND	Surgery followed by radiotherapy and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide is standard therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .
BACKGROUND	Bevacizumab combined with irinotecan produces impressive response rates in recurrent GBM .
BACKGROUND	In a randomized phase II study , we investigated the efficacy of neoadjuvant bevacizumab combined with irinotecan ( Bev-Iri ) versus bevacizumab combined with temozolomide ( Bev-Tem ) before , during and after radiotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM .
METHODS	After surgery , patients were randomized to Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem for eight weeks , followed by standard radiotherapy ( @ Gy/@ fractions ) and concomitant Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem followed by adjuvant Bev-Iri or Bev-Tem for another eight weeks .
METHODS	Bev-Iri : Bevacizumab and irinotecan were given every @ days before , during and after radiotherapy .
METHODS	Bev-Tem : Bevacizumab was given as in Bev-Iri and temozolomide was given for five days every four weeks before and after radiotherapy and once daily during radiotherapy .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a pre-specified response rate of @ % or more was considered of interest for future studies .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival ( PFS ) and toxicity .
RESULTS	The response rate was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) for Bev-Tem ( n = @ ) and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) for Bev-Iri ( n = @ ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median PFS was @ and @ months for Bev-Tem and Bev-Iri , respectively .
RESULTS	Hematological toxicity was more frequent with Bev-Tem including one death from febrile neutropenia whereas non-hematological toxicity was manageable .
CONCLUSIONS	Only the Bev-Tem arm met the pre-specified level of activity of interest .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results did not indicate any benefit from Bev-Iri in first-line therapy as opposed to Bev-Tem in terms of response and PFS .

BACKGROUND	Post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) is a serious complication of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) of the leg that affects @-@ % of patients .
BACKGROUND	Once a patient experiences PTS there is no treatment that effectively reduces the debilitating complaints .
BACKGROUND	Two randomised controlled trials showed that elastic compression stocking ( ECS ) therapy after DVT for @ months can reduce the incidence of PTS by @ % .
BACKGROUND	However , it is unclear whether all patients benefit to the same extent from ECS therapy or what the optimal duration of therapy for individual patients should be .
BACKGROUND	ECS therapy is costly , inconvenient , demanding and sometimes even debilitating .
BACKGROUND	Tailoring therapy to individual needs could save substantial costs .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the IDEAL DVT study , therefore , is to evaluate whether tailoring the duration of ECS therapy on signs and symptoms of the individual patient is a safe and effective method to prevent PTS , compared with standard ECS therapy .
METHODS	A multicentre , single-blinded , allocation concealed , randomised , non-inferiority trial .
METHODS	A total of @ consecutive patients with acute objectively documented proximal DVT of the leg are randomised to either standard duration of @ months or tailored duration of ECS therapy following an initial therapeutic period of @ months .
METHODS	Signs and symptoms of PTS are recorded at regular clinic visits .
METHODS	Furthermore , quality of life , costs , patient preferences and compliance are measured .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with PTS at @ months .
BACKGROUND	Based on current knowledge the standard application of ECS therapy is questioned .
BACKGROUND	The IDEAL DVT study will address the central questions that remain unanswered : Which individual patients benefit from ECS therapy and what is the optimal individual treatment duration ?
BACKGROUND	Primary ethics approval was received from the Maastricht University Medical Centre .
RESULTS	Results of the study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of newly designed positively aspherized progressive addition lenses ( PA-PALs ) , which reduce both lag of accommodation and hyperopic defocus on the peripheral retina , on the progression of early-onset myopia .
METHODS	Positively aspherized-PALs have near addition and high positive distance zone aspherization comparable to the addition power .
METHODS	One hundred ninety-seven children were enrolled , @ to @ years of age , with spherical equivalent refraction from -@ to -@ diopters ( D ) .
METHODS	The children were randomized to receive one of three lenses : single vision lenses ( SVLs ) , PA-PALs with +@ D addition , or PA-PALs with +@ D addition .
METHODS	Follow-up visits occurred every @ months for @ years .
METHODS	The primary outcome was myopia progression evaluated by cycloplegic autorefraction .
RESULTS	One hundred sixty-nine ( @ % ) children completed the follow-up .
RESULTS	Statistical analysis of adjusted progression rates showed a mean ( SE ) progression of -@ @ D in the control group wearing SVLs at the @-month visit .
RESULTS	Statistically significant ( P = @ ) retardation of myopia progression ( @ @ D during @-month period or reduction ratio of @ % ) by +@ D add PA-PALs relative to the SVLs was found , which was within the range of the percentage efficacy of myopia retardation by the conventional PALs in earlier trials over the same follow-up period .
RESULTS	Nearly all retardation occurred in the first @ months with no significant efficacy in the second year .
RESULTS	Positively aspherized-PALs with +@ D addition showed negligible efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	To the extent that has been tested and that can be tolerated by wearers of spectacle lenses , the high positive aspherization of the distance zone added to PALs does not enhance their therapeutic efficacy in slowing myopia progression .
CONCLUSIONS	( http://www.anzctr.org.au/ number , ACTRN@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	To study the clinical effects of hypoxia preconditioning ( HPC ) and its effects on serum neuroglobin ( NGB ) and S-@B level in the patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm surgery .
METHODS	Forty patients scheduled to intracranial aneurysm surgery were randomly.divided into @ groups : HPC group ( n = @ ) and control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The patients in HPC group were treated with @ cycles of deoxidation-reoxygenation after intubation .
METHODS	The time of deoxidation in each HPC cycle was recorded , while vital signs were also recorded in each corresponding time point .
METHODS	Blood samples were obtained from exsanguinate radial artery and jugular bulb section at the end of each HPC cycle and corresponding time points during operation to measure serum level of NGB and S@B protein and to analysis blood gas .
RESULTS	During HPC process , the patients in group HPC experienced mild hypoxia and CO@ retention .
RESULTS	With the times of HPC increasing , CO@ retention degree became heavier ( P < @ ) while hypoxia improved , the patients need more time to make SpO@ from @ % to @ % ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	From T@ to T@ ( the end of the third reoxygenation , during skull opened and aneurysm dipped , skull closed ) , NGB in group HPC was higher than that in control ( P < @ ) , but S-@B level was not different between HPC and control group ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	HPC could induce compensatory ability of the body to hypoxia , which might be related to the up-regulation of NGB expression .

METHODS	This Human Insurance Portability and Accountability-compliant , institutional review board-approved prospective study was performed using SpS-SubmSv IRT chest CT in @ non-obese patients ( body-mass index , @-@ kg/m ; age range , @-@ years ) .
METHODS	Written informed consent was obtained .
METHODS	The patients were scanned at standard-dose CT ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- volumetric CT dose index , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- mGy ; mean -LSB- SD -RSB- dose-length product , @ @ mGycm ; and mean -LSB- SD -RSB- effective dose , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- mSv ) and at SubmSv dose ( @ -LSB- @ -RSB- mGy , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- mGycm , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- mSv , respectively ) on a Philips @-slice CT scanner with double z-sampling .
METHODS	Sparse angular sampling data were reconstructed using @ % of the angular projections from the SubmSv sinogram to reduce the number of views and radiation dose by approximately @-fold .
METHODS	Hence , the patients were scanned and then , simulation-based sparse sampling was performed with a resultant dose hypothetical SpS scan estimated mathematically ( @ mSv ) .
METHODS	From each patient data , @ digital imaging and communications in medicine series were generated : SpS-SubmSv with IRT , fully sampled SubmSv filtered back projection ( FBP ) , and fully sampled standard-dose FBP ( SD-FBP ) .
METHODS	Two radiologists independently assessed these image series for detection of lung lesions , visibility of small structures , and diagnostic acceptability .
METHODS	Objective noise was measured in the thoracic aorta , and noise spectral density was obtained for SpS-SubmSv IRT , SubmSv-FBP , and SD-FBP .
RESULTS	The SpS-SubmSv IRT resulted in @ % ( @ / @ mSv ) and @ % ( @ / @ mSv ) dose reduction , when compared with the fully sampled SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP , respectively .
RESULTS	Images of SpS-SubmSv displayed all @ lesions ( most < @ cm , @ lung nodules , @ ground glass opacities , @ emphysema ) seen on the SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP data sets .
RESULTS	Lesion margins with sparse-sampled data were deemed acceptable compared with both SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP .
RESULTS	Overall diagnostic confidence was maintained with SpS-SubmSv IRT despite the presence of minor pixilation artifacts in @ of @ cases .
RESULTS	The SpS-SubmSv IRT showed @ % and @ % noise reduction when compared with SubmSv-FBP ( P < @ ) and SD-FBP ( P < @ ) , respectively , with no significant change in Hounsfield unit values ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Noise-spectral density showed that SpS-SubmSv IRT gives a linear decrease over frequency in the semilog plot and an exponential decrease of noise power over frequency compared with SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP .
CONCLUSIONS	More than @ % dose reduction could be achieved with one-fourth sparse-sampled and SubmSv chest CT examination when reconstructed with IRT .
CONCLUSIONS	Chest CT dose at one fourth of a millisievert with SpS is possible with optimal lesion detection and diagnostic confidence for the evaluation of pulmonary findings .

OBJECTIVE	A number of interventions for at-risk children have shown benefits for children 's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity immediately after treatment .
OBJECTIVE	It is critical to examine whether such changes are maintained over time , given that physiological regulation is implicated in later mental and physical health outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	To examine whether differences in diurnal cortisol production between children receiving the active parenting intervention and children in the control group persisted at a preschool follow-up ( approximately @ years following intervention ) .
METHODS	Between-subject comparison of cortisol patterns among @ groups of children ( experimental and control groups ) involved with Child Protective Services following allegations of neglect .
METHODS	The participants included @ children ( @ % female ) between @ and @ months of age ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- months ) who had been previously randomly assigned to either the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up ( ABC ) intervention ( n = @ ) or the control intervention ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The experimental ABC intervention focused on @ aims : increasing parental nurturance to child distress , increasing synchronous interactions , and decreasing frightening parental behavior .
METHODS	The control intervention provided educational information about child development to parents .
METHODS	Both interventions were manualized and involved @ sessions implemented by a trained parent coach in the families ' homes or other places of residence .
METHODS	Salivary cortisol samples collected at waking and bedtime for children on @ separate days .
RESULTS	Analyses revealed significant differences in cortisol production at the preschool follow-up , such that children in the ABC intervention group showed more typical patterns of cortisol production than children in the control intervention group .
RESULTS	Specifically , children in the ABC group exhibited higher mean ( SD ) log-transformed morning levels than children in the control group ( -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- vs -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- g/dL , respectively -LSB- to convert to nanomoles per liter , multiply by @ -RSB- ; = @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Bedtime cortisol levels did not differ significantly between the ABC and DEF groups ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- , -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- vs -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- g/dL , respectively ; @ = -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Those in the ABC group showed a steeper decline in cortisol across the day ( mean , -@ g/dL ) than those in the control group , who showed a blunted cortisol rhythm ( mean , -@ g/dL ) ( = -@ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Differences in cortisol production between the experimental and control groups persisted at the preschool follow-up and resembled differences initially observed @ months following intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	This is encouraging evidence that the ABC intervention for Child Protective Services-referred children may have long-lasting effects on a physiological stress system critical for health and adjustment .

OBJECTIVE	Growing , small , peripheral , pulmonary nodules in patients at high risk for lung cancer lead to requests for video-assisted thoracoscopic ( VATS ) resection for pathologic diagnosis .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine if preoperative localization using percutaneously placed computed tomography ( CT ) - guided platinum microcoils decreases the need for thoracotomy or VATS anatomic resection ( segmentectomy/lobectomy ) for diagnosis .
METHODS	Patients with undiagnosed nodules of @ mm or less were randomized to either no localization or preoperative microcoil localization .
METHODS	Coils were placed with the distal end deep to the nodule and the superficial end coiled on the visceral pleural surface with subsequent visualization by intraoperative fluoroscopy and VATS.Nodules were removed by VATS wedge excision using endostaplers .
METHODS	The primary outcome was a VATS wedge excision for pathologic diagnosis of the nodule without the need for either thoracotomy or VATS anatomic resection .
RESULTS	Sixty patients were randomized and @ underwent surgery between March @ and June @ .
RESULTS	Twenty-nine underwent microcoil localization and @ did not .
RESULTS	The baseline characteristics ( age , sex , forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration , nodule size/depth ) were similar .
RESULTS	The coil group had a higher rate of successful diagnosis with VATS wedge resection alone ( @/@ vs @/@ ; P < @ ) , decreased operative time to nodule excision ( @ @ vs @ @ minutes ; P < @ ) , and reduced stapler firings ( @ @ vs @ @ ; P = @ ) with no difference in total costs .
RESULTS	Pathologic diagnoses included @ benign nodules , @ primary lung malignancies , and @ metastases .
RESULTS	There were no clinically significant complications related to the coil placement or wedge resection .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative CT-guided microcoil localization decreases the need for thoracotomy or VATS anatomic resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules .

OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of an eight-month program combining training in self-management for both psychiatric and general medical illness , including embedded nurse care management .
METHODS	Participants were @ middle-aged and older adults ( mean age = @ @ ) with serious mental illness and chronic general medical conditions who were randomly assigned to receive integrated Illness Management and Recovery ( I-IMR ) ( N = @ ) or usual care ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Feasibility was determined by attendance at I-IMR and nurse sessions .
METHODS	Effectiveness outcomes were measured two and six months after the intervention ( ten - and @-month follow-ups ) and included self-management of psychiatric and general medical illness , participation in psychiatric and general medical encounters , and self-reported acute health care utilization .
RESULTS	I-IMR participants attended @ @ I-IMR and @ @ nurse sessions , with @ % attending at least ten I-IMR and five nurse sessions .
RESULTS	Compared with usual care , I-IMR was associated with greater improvements in participant and clinician ratings for psychiatric illness self-management , greater diabetes self-management , and an increased preference for detailed diagnosis and treatment information during primary care encounters .
RESULTS	The proportion of I-IMR participants with at least one psychiatric or general medical hospitalization decreased significantly between baseline and ten - and @-month follow-ups .
CONCLUSIONS	I-IMR is a feasible intervention for this at-risk group and demonstrated potential effectiveness by improving self-management of psychiatric illness and diabetes and by reducing the proportion of participants requiring psychiatric or general medical hospitalizations .

OBJECTIVE	To compare contrast sensitivity , visual acuity ( VA ) , and halos in subjects bilaterally implanted with @ of @ FDA-approved presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized , partially masked , multicenter clinical trial .
METHODS	Seventy-eight subjects were randomized sequentially for bilateral implantation with the Crystalens AO ( Bausch & Lomb Surgical ) , AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +@ ( Alcon Laboratories ) , or Tecnis Multifocal ( Abbott Medical Optics ) lenses .
METHODS	Subjects were evaluated through visit @ ( @ to @months after surgery ) with the following monocular and binocular assessments : high - and low-contrast VA , contrast sensitivity without glare , halos or starbursts , defocus curves , optical scatter , retinal point spread function , and safety .
RESULTS	The Crystalens AO and ReSTOR +@ demonstrated better monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity without glare at low to mid spatial frequencies compared with the Tecnis Multifocal lens .
RESULTS	Binocular uncorrected distance VA was not significantly different between the @ lenses .
RESULTS	The Crystalens AO had significantly better binocular low-contrast distance-corrected VA than the ReSTOR +@ and better mean monocular low-contrast DCVA than the Tecnis Multifocal lens .
RESULTS	The Crystalens AO demonstrated significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +@ or Tecnis Multifocal lenses .
RESULTS	The ReSTOR +@ lens had significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected near VA tested at @cm compared with the Crystalens AO and Tecnis Multifocal lens .
RESULTS	The Crystalens AO elicited significantly less halos than the Tecnis Multifocal lens and less optical scatter than the ReSTOR +@ or Tecnis Multifocal lens .
CONCLUSIONS	The Crystalens AO had statistically better uncorrected intermediate VA and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +@ or Tecnis Multifocal lenses and fewer photic phenomenon than the Tecnis Multifocal lens .
CONCLUSIONS	Both multifocals had better distance-corrected near VA and uncorrected near VA than the Crystalens AO .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may guide intraocular lens selection for individual patients seeking to optimize vision at specific vergences or lighting conditions .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of the isolated use of tacrolimus compared with the combined use of tacrolimus and olopatadine for the treatment of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis ( VKC ) .
METHODS	Twenty-one patients with severe VKC were randomized into two groups : one treated with @ % tacrolimus ointment combined with @ % olopatadine ophthalmic solution and the other with @ % tacrolimus ointment combined with placebo eye drops .
METHODS	The clinical signs and symptoms were graded from @ to @ , and the efficacy of treatment was determined by the difference between the score at the beginning of treatment and after @ days .
METHODS	The clinical impression of improvement as perceived by the evaluator and the self-assessment provided by the patient were scored at day @ of treatment and compared between the groups .
RESULTS	The scores for symptoms decreased between the assessments in both groups ( -@ in the experimental group ; -@ in the control group ) , with no significant difference between groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The scores for clinical signs decreased between the assessments in the experimental group ( -@ ) and increased in the control group ( @ ) but with no significant differences ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the self-assessment ( P = @ ) and the clinical impression of the evaluator ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The isolated use of tacrolimus and the combined use of tacrolimus and olopatadine seems to have the same efficacy , although controlled studies with larger samples are required to confirm this hypothesis .

BACKGROUND	The determination of dosing regimens for the treatment of malaria is largely empirical and thus a better understanding of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of antimalarial agents is required to assess the adequacy of current treatment regimens and identify sources of suboptimal dosing that could select for drug-resistant parasites .
BACKGROUND	Mefloquine is a widely used antimalarial , commonly given in combination with artesunate .
METHODS	Mefloquine pharmacokinetics was assessed in @ healthy adults and @ patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria administered mefloquine in combination with artesunate .
METHODS	Population pharmacokinetic modelling was conducted using NONMEM .
RESULTS	A two-compartment model with a single transit compartment and first-order elimination from the central compartment most adequately described mefloquine concentration-time data .
RESULTS	The model incorporated population parameter variability for clearance ( CL/F ) , central volume of distribution ( VC/F ) and absorption rate constant ( KA ) and identified , in addition to body weight , malaria infection as a covariate for VC/F ( but not CL/F ) .
RESULTS	Monte Carlo simulations predict that falciparum malaria infection is associated with a shorter elimination half-life ( @ versus @ h ) and T > MIC ( @ versus @ h ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first known population pharmacokinetic study to show falciparum malaria to influence mefloquine disposition .
CONCLUSIONS	Protein binding , anaemia and other factors may contribute to differences between healthy individuals and patients .
CONCLUSIONS	As VC/F is related to the earlier portion of the concentration-time profiles , which occurs during acute malaria , and CL/F is more related to the terminal phase during convalescence after treatment , this may explain why malaria was found to be a covariate for VC/F but not CL/F .

BACKGROUND	Tinnitus occurs in a large part of the general population with prevalences ranging from @ % to @ % in an adult population .
BACKGROUND	One subtype is cervicogenic somatic tinnitus , arising from cervical spine dysfunctions , justifying cervical spine assessment and treatment .
BACKGROUND	This study aims to investigate the effect of a standardized physical therapy treatment , directed to the cervical spine , on tinnitus .
BACKGROUND	Additionally , a second aim is to identify a subgroup within the tinnitus population that benefits from physical therapy treatment .
METHODS	This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with delayed treatment design .
METHODS	Patients with severe subjective tinnitus ( Tinnitus Functional Index ( TFI ) between @ and @ points ) , in combination with neck complaints ( Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire ( NBQ ) > @ points ) will be recruited from the University Hospital of Antwerp .
METHODS	Patients suffering from tinnitus with clear otological etiologies , severe depression , traumatic cervical spine injury , tumors , cervical spine surgery , or conditions in which physical therapy is contra-indicated , will be excluded.After screening for eligibility , baseline data such as TFI , NBQ , and a set of cervical biomechanical and sensorimotor tests will be collected .
METHODS	Patients are randomized in an immediate therapy group and in a group with a delayed start of therapy by @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients will receive physical therapy with a maximum of @ sessions of @ min for a @-week program .
METHODS	Data from the TFI and NBQ will be collected at baseline ( week @ ) , at the start of therapy ( weeks @ or @ ) , at the end of therapy ( weeks @ or @ ) , @ weeks after therapy ( weeks @ or @ ) , and @ months after therapy ( weeks @ or @ ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures will be collected at baseline and @ weeks after the therapy ( weeks @ or @ ) , as the maximal therapy effect on the cervical spine dysfunctions is expected at that moment .
CONCLUSIONS	This study is the first to investigate the effect of a standardized physical therapy treatment protocol on somatic tinnitus with a prospective comparative delayed design and with blinded evaluator for baseline , end of therapy , and @ and @ weeks after therapy .

BACKGROUND	Inflammation is involved in development , progression , and complications of atherosclerotic disease .
BACKGROUND	Clinical studies have indicated that the level of monocyte chemoattractant protein @ ( MCP-@ ) , IL-@ , and adhesion molecules correlates with the severity of atherosclerosis and can predict future cardiovascular events .
BACKGROUND	Experimental studies have shown pentoxifylline ( PTX ) reduces these factors in animal models .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present pilot study was to evaluate effect of PTX on a group of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
METHODS	Forty patients with angiographically documented CAD , who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria , were entered in the double-blind , randomized , pilot clinical study .
METHODS	The patients were randomly given PTX ( @ mg three times daily ) or placebo ( @ tab/day ) for @ months .
METHODS	Serum concentrations of MCP-@ , IL-@ , intercellular adhesion Molecule @ ( ICAM-@ ) , and vascular cell adhesion molecule @ ( VCAM-@ ) were measured before and at the end of intervention by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay .
RESULTS	Our study showed that the serum levels of ICAM-@ and VCAM-@ was decreased in the study population after two-month treatment ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the results of our pilot study , administration of PTX in CAD patients significantly decreases adhesion molecules levels .

BACKGROUND	The incremental prognostic value of high-sensitive troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) in heart failure ( HF ) beyond that of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and amino-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide is debated .
BACKGROUND	We examined the prognostic value of hs-cTnT in a subgroup of patients from the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in HF ( CORONA ) study .
RESULTS	Hs-cTnT as a risk factor for the primary end point ( cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and nonfatal stroke ; n = @ ) , as well as all-cause mortality ( n = @ ) , cardiovascular mortality ( n = @ ) , and the composite of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization from worsening of HF ( n = @ ) , was investigated in @ patients ( @ years ; New York Heart Association -LSB- NYHA -RSB- class II-IV , ischemic systolic HF ) randomly assigned to @ mg rosuvastatin or placebo .
RESULTS	In multivariable analyses , adjusting for left ventricular ejection fraction , NYHA class , age , body mass index , diabetes mellitus , sex , intermittent claudication , heart rate , estimated glomerular filtration rate , apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-@ ratio , amino-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , and hs-cTnT ( both dichotomized according to the @th percentile and as a continuous variable ) was associated with all end points ( primary end point : hazard ratio , @ and @ , respectively , per SD change ; P < @ ; all other end points : hazard ratio , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	However , improved discrimination as assessed by C-statistics was only seen for the primary end point and all-cause mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated hs-cTnT levels provide strong and independent prognostic information in older patients with chronic ischemic HF .

BACKGROUND	Despite all the technological advances in orthodontics , orthodontic treatment still seems to involve some degree of discomfort and/or pain .
BACKGROUND	Pain control during orthodontic therapy is of great concern to both orthodontists and patients .
BACKGROUND	However , there has been limited research into controlling such pain .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this work was to assess patient-perceived pain following fixed orthodontic treatment and to evaluate the comparative analgesic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for controlling pain .
METHODS	A total of @patients about to undergo fixed appliance orthodontic treatment were enrolled in this double-blind prospective study .
METHODS	Patients were evenly and randomly distributed in a blinded manner to one of three groups as follows : paracetamol/acetaminophen @mg thrice daily ; placebo in the form of empty capsules ; and etoricoxib @mg once daily .
METHODS	Drug administration began @h before initiating the bonding procedure and archwire placement , and given until the day@ .
METHODS	The pain perceived was recorded by the patients on a linear and graded Visual Analogue Scale at time intervals of @h after insertion of the appliance ; @h thereafter and again at nighttime of the same day of the appointment ; @h later and on the @nd day at nighttime ; @h after the appointment and on day@ at nighttime .
RESULTS	Our results revealed that moderately intense pain is associated with routine orthodontic treatment , and that the amount of pain individuals perceive varies widely .
RESULTS	We observed statistically significant differences in the pain control among the three groups , and that etoricoxib @mg proved most efficient .
CONCLUSIONS	Etoricoxib @mg is highly efficacious for controlling pain during fixed orthodontic appliance therapy .

OBJECTIVE	The use of drug-eluting stents ( DES ) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) is controversial and not yet endorsed in clinical guidelines .
RESULTS	This was an a priori planned post hoc analysis involving @ NSTE-ACS patients from the randomised BASKET-PROVE trial ( sirolimus-eluting stent vs. everolimus-eluting stent vs. bare metal stent in large-vessel stenting ) .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was the combined two-year rate of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
RESULTS	Secondary endpoints were each component of the primary endpoint , and clinically indicated target vessel revascularisation ( TVR ) and stent thrombosis .
RESULTS	Compared to patients with BMS , those treated with SES and EES had a strong trend towards lower two-year rates of the primary endpoint ( HR : @ -LSB- CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ , and HR : @ -LSB- CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) , and of TVR ( HR : @ -LSB- CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) and ( HR : @ -LSB- CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	When the SES and EES groups were combined and compared to BMS , significant reductions in both cardiovascular death/MI and TVR were found .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with BMS , use of DES in NSTE-ACS patients undergoing stent implantation in large vessels was associated with a reduction in both TVR and the combined endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death/MI .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , DES use improves both efficacy and safety .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support the use of DES in NSTE-ACS patients .

BACKGROUND	Data are limited on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions targeted at blood pressure ( BP ) control in hypertensive blacks who receive care in low-resource primary care practices .
RESULTS	Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which @ community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention condition ( IC ) or usual care ( UC ) .
RESULTS	Patients at the IC sites received patient education , home BP monitoring , and monthly lifestyle counseling , whereas physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients ' home BP readings and chart audits .
RESULTS	Patients and physicians at the UC sites received printed patient education material and hypertension treatment guidelines , respectively .
RESULTS	The primary outcome was BP control , and secondary outcomes were mean changes in systolic and diastolic BPs at @ months , assessed with an automated BP device .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( mean age , @ years ; @ % men , @ % obese , and @ % with diabetes mellitus ) were enrolled .
RESULTS	The BP control rate was similar in both groups ( IC = @ % versus UC = @ % ; odds ratio , @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In prespecified subgroup analyses , the intervention was associated with greater BP control in patients without diabetes mellitus ( IC = @ % versus UC = @ % ; odds ratio , @ -LSB- confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ) ; and small-sized community health centers ( IC = @ % versus UC = @ % ; odds ratio , @ -LSB- confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A practice-based , multicomponent intervention was no better than UC in improving BP control among hypertensive blacks .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research on the implementation of behavioral modification strategies for hypertension control in low-resource settings should focus on the development of more efficient and tailored interventions in this high-risk population .

OBJECTIVE	The fast development of e-learning and social forums demands us to update our understanding of e-learning and peer learning .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate if higher , pre-defined levels of e-learning or social interaction in web forums improved students ' learning ability .
METHODS	One hundred and twenty Danish medical students were randomized to six groups all with @ students ( eCases level @ , eCases level @ , eCases level @ + , eTextbook level @ , eTextbook level @ , and eTextbook level @ + ) .
METHODS	All students participated in a pre-test , Group @ participated in an interactive case-based e-learning program , while Group @ was presented with textbook material electronically .
METHODS	The @ + groups were able to discuss the material between themselves in a web forum .
METHODS	The subject was head injury and associated treatment and observation guidelines in the emergency room .
METHODS	Following the e-learning , all students completed a post-test .
METHODS	Pre - and post-tests both consisted of @ questions randomly chosen from a pool of @ different questions .
RESULTS	All students concluded the study with comparable pre-test results .
RESULTS	Students at Level @ ( in both groups ) improved statistically significant compared to students at level @ ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between level @ and level @ + .
RESULTS	However , level @ + was associated with statistically significant greater student 's satisfaction than the rest of the students ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study applies a new way of comparing different types of e-learning using a pre-defined level division and the possibility of peer learning .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings show that higher levels of e-learning does in fact provide better results when compared with the same type of e-learning at lower levels .
CONCLUSIONS	While social interaction in web forums increase student satisfaction , learning ability does not seem to change .
CONCLUSIONS	Both findings are relevant when designing new e-learning materials .

BACKGROUND	Conventional food production commonly uses organophosphate ( OP ) pesticides , which can have negative health effects , while organic food is deemed healthier because it is produced without these pesticides .
BACKGROUND	Studies suggest that organic food consumption may significantly reduce OP pesticide exposure in children who have relatively higher pesticide exposure than adults due to their different diets , body weight , behaviour and less efficient metabolism .
OBJECTIVE	A prospective , randomised , crossover study was conducted to determine if an organic food diet reduces organophosphate exposure in adults .
METHODS	Thirteen participants were randomly allocated to consume a diet of at least @ % organic or conventional food for @ days and then crossed over to the alternate diet .
METHODS	Urinary levels of six dialkylphosphate metabolites were analysed in first-morning voids collected on day @ of each phase using GC-MS/MS with detection limits of @-@ @ g/L .
RESULTS	The mean total DAP results in the organic phase were @ % lower than in the conventional phase ( M = @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- respectively , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	For total dimethyl DAPs there was a @ % reduction ( M = @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- respectively , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean total diethyl DAP levels in the organic phase were half those of the conventional phase ( M = @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- respectively ) , yet the wide variability and small sample size meant the difference was not statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	The consumption of an organic diet for one week significantly reduced OP pesticide exposure in adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger scale studies in different populations are required to confirm these findings and investigate their clinical relevance .

BACKGROUND	Aortic-root dissection is the leading cause of death in Marfan 's syndrome .
BACKGROUND	Studies suggest that with regard to slowing aortic-root enlargement , losartan may be more effective than beta-blockers , the current standard therapy in most centers .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized trial comparing losartan with atenolol in children and young adults with Marfan 's syndrome .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the rate of aortic-root enlargement , expressed as the change in the maximum aortic-root-diameter z score indexed to body-surface area ( hereafter , aortic-root z score ) over a @-year period .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic root ; the rate of change in aortic regurgitation ; the time to aortic dissection , aortic-root surgery , or death ; somatic growth ; and the incidence of adverse events .
RESULTS	From January @ through February @ , a total of @ clinical centers enrolled @ participants , @ months to @ years of age ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- age , @ years in the atenolol group and @ years in the losartan group ) , who had an aortic-root z score greater than @ .
RESULTS	The baseline-adjusted rate of change in the mean ( SE ) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the atenolol group and the losartan group ( -@ and -@ standard-deviation units per year , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both slopes were significantly less than zero , indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface area with either treatment .
RESULTS	The @-year rates of aortic-root surgery , aortic dissection , death , and a composite of these events did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Among children and young adults with Marfan 's syndrome who were randomly assigned to losartan or atenolol , we found no significant difference in the rate of aortic-root dilatation between the two treatment groups over a @-year period .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute and others ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

METHODS	Patients with symptomatic nOH due to Parkinson disease , multiple system atrophy , pure autonomic failure , or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy underwent open-label droxidopa dose optimization ( @-@ mg @ times daily ) , followed , in responders , by @-day washout and then a @-day double-blind trial of droxidopa vs placebo .
METHODS	Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire ( OHQ ) , a validated , nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities .
RESULTS	From randomization to endpoint ( n = @ ) , improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by @ units ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by @ units ( p = @ ) , with maximum change in `` dizziness/lightheadedness . ''
RESULTS	Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by @ units ( p = @ ) , with maximum change for `` standing a long time . ''
RESULTS	Mean standing systolic blood pressure ( BP ) increased by @ vs @ mm Hg ( p < @ ) , and mean supine systolic BP by @ vs @ mm Hg ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	At endpoint , supine systolic BP > @ mm Hg was observed in @ % of droxidopa and @ % of placebo recipients .
RESULTS	Adverse events reported in @ % of double-blind droxidopa recipients were headache ( @ % ) and dizziness ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with symptomatic nOH , droxidopa improved symptoms and symptom impact on daily activities , with an associated increase in standing systolic BP , and was generally well tolerated .
METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with symptomatic nOH who respond to open-label droxidopa , droxidopa improves subjective and objective manifestation of nOH at @ days .

OBJECTIVE	Midazolam comedication with morphine is a routine practice in pre and postoperative patients but has not been evaluated in prehospital setting .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to evaluate the comedication effect of midazolam in the prehospital traumatic adults .
METHODS	A prehospital prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous morphine @ mg/kg and midazolam @ mg/kg vs morphine @ mg/kg and placebo .
METHODS	Pain assessment was done using a validated numeric rating scale ( NRS ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was to achieve an efficient analgesic effect ( NRS@ ) @ minutes after the baseline .
METHODS	The secondary end points were treatment safety , total morphine dose required until obtaining NRS@ , and efficient analgesic effect @ minutes after the baseline .
RESULTS	Ninety-one patients were randomized into midazolam ( n = @ ) and placebo ( n = @ ) groups .
RESULTS	No significant difference in proportion of patients with a pain score@ was observed between midazolam ( @ % ) and placebo ( @ % ) after @ minutes ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Secondary end points were similar in regard with proportion of patients with a pain score@ at T@ , the side effects and adverse events except for drowsiness in midazolam vs placebo , @ % vs @ % ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference in total morphine dose was observed , that is , midazolam ( @ mg@ @ ) vs placebo ( @ mg@ @ ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	According to our study , midazolam does not enhance pain control as an adjunctive to morphine regimen in the management of trauma-induced pain in prehospital setting .
CONCLUSIONS	However , such midazolam use seems to be associated with an increase in drowsiness .

BACKGROUND	Recent initiatives to target the personal , social and clinical needs of people with long-term health conditions have had limited impact within primary care .
BACKGROUND	Evidence of the importance of social networks to support people with long-term conditions points to the need for self-management approaches which align personal circumstances with valued activities .
BACKGROUND	The Patient-Led Assessment for Network Support ( PLANS ) intervention is a needs-led assessment for patients to prioritise their health and social needs and provide access to local community services and activities .
BACKGROUND	Exploring the work and practices of patients and telephone workers are important for understanding and evaluating the workability and implementation of new interventions .
METHODS	Qualitative methods ( interviews , focus group , observations ) were used to explore the experience of PLANS from the perspectives of participants and the telephone support workers who delivered it ( as part of an RCT ) and the reasons why the intervention worked or not .
METHODS	Normalisation Process Theory ( NPT ) was used as a sensitising tool to evaluate : the relevance of PLANS to patients ( coherence ) ; the processes of engagement ( cognitive participation ) ; the work done for PLANS to happen ( collective action ) ; the perceived benefits and costs of PLANS ( reflexive monitoring ) .
METHODS	@ patients in the intervention arm of a clinical trial were interviewed and their telephone support calls were recorded and a focus group with @ telephone support workers was conducted .
RESULTS	Analysis of the interviews , support calls and focus group identified three themes in relation to the delivery and experience of PLANS .
RESULTS	These are : formulation of ` health ' in the context of everyday life ; trajectories and tipping points : disrupting everyday routines ; precarious trust in networks .
RESULTS	The relevance of these themes are considered using NPT constructs in terms of the work that is entailed in engaging with PLANS , taking action , and who is implicated this process .
CONCLUSIONS	PLANS gives scope to align long-term condition management to everyday life priorities and valued aspects of life .
CONCLUSIONS	This approach can improve engagement with health-relevant practices by situating them within everyday contexts .
CONCLUSIONS	This has potential to increase utilisation of local resources with potential cost-saving benefits for the NHS .

METHODS	Randomized trial .
METHODS	Outpatient center .
METHODS	One hundred women in spontaneous menopause with at least three episodes of hot flushes daily were randomly allocated to two treatment groups ( @ per group ) : Women in group A were given diet , self-massage training , and treatment with acupuncture , and women in group B ( the control group ) were given the same diet and self-massage training , but treatment with acupuncture started @ weeks after they were enrolled into the study .
METHODS	Acupuncture treatments were scheduled twice weekly for @ consecutive weeks .
METHODS	Mean change in frequency and/or intensity in menopause-related symptoms were estimated by questionnaire after treatment at week @ .
RESULTS	Treatment with acupuncture significantly reduced the occurrence of hot flushes and sudden sweating ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Other symptoms ( sleep disorders , tightness in the chest , irritability , bone pain , feeling depressed ) significantly improved .
CONCLUSIONS	Acupuncture in an integrated system that includes therapeutic techniques such as diet therapy and Tuina self-massage can be used to treat hot flushes and selected symptoms in postmenopausal women .

OBJECTIVE	Although social anxiety disorder is a common and sometimes disabling condition , there are no approved treatments that can be used on an as-needed basis .
OBJECTIVE	The authors examined the acute use of PH@B , an intranasally administered neurosteroidal aerosol , for the acute management of the symptoms of social anxiety disorder .
METHODS	The authors conducted a phase @ , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose study of PH@B .
METHODS	Ninety-one women @-@ years of age with generalized social anxiety disorder received placebo intranasal spray ( single-blind ) @ minutes before laboratory-simulated public speaking and social interaction challenges .
METHODS	Patients who experienced significant distress during at least one challenge returned @ week later to receive either intranasal PH@B or placebo aerosol spray ( double-blind ) before repeat challenges .
RESULTS	Patients who received PH@B during the second set of challenges had a significantly greater decrease in mean Subjective Units of Distress scores during the public speaking and social interaction challenges compared with the first set of challenges , than did patients who received placebo for both sets of challenges .
RESULTS	A significantly greater proportion of the PH@B group were much or very much improved from the first to the second sets of challenges compared with the placebo group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The side effects of PH@B were benign .
CONCLUSIONS	PH@B may be a novel , effective , and well-tolerated acute treatment for performance and social anxiety in women with social anxiety disorder .

BACKGROUND	Autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI ) aims to restore hyaline cartilage .
BACKGROUND	Traditionally , ACI rehabilitation is prescribed in a concurrent ( CON ) format .
BACKGROUND	However , it is well known from studies in asymptomatic populations that CON training produces an interference effect that can attenuate strength gains .
BACKGROUND	Strength is integral to joint function , so adopting a nonconcurrent ( N-CON ) approach to ACI rehabilitation might improve outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	To assess changes in function and neuromuscular performance during @ wk of CON and N-CON physical rehabilitation after ACI to the knee .
METHODS	Orthopedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust .
METHODS	Randomized control , pilot study .
METHODS	@ patients ( @ male , @ female ; age @ @ y ; body mass @ @ kg ; time from injury to surgery @ @ mo -LSB- mean SD -RSB- ) randomly allocated to N-CON : CON ( @:@ ) .
METHODS	Standardized CON and N-CON physiotherapy that involved separation of strength and cardiovascular-endurance conditioning .
METHODS	Function in the single-leg-hop test , patient-reported outcomes ( Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score -LSB- KOOS -RSB- , International Knee Documentation Committee subjective questionnaire -LSB- IKDC -RSB- ) , and neuromuscular outcomes of peak force ( PF ) , rate of force development ( RFD ) , electromechanical delay ( EMD ) , and sensorimotor performance ( force error -LSB- FE -RSB- ) of the knee extensors and flexors of the injured and noninjured legs , measured presurgery and at @ , @ , @ , and @ wk postsurgery .
RESULTS	Factorial ANOVAs with repeated measures of group by leg and by test occasion revealed significantly superior improvements for KOOS , IKDC , PF , EMD , and FE associated with N-CON vs. CON rehabilitation ( F ( @,@ GG ) = @-@ @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	These results confirm increased peak effectiveness of N-CON rehabilitation ( ~ @-@ @ % better than CON over @ wk of rehabilitation ) .
RESULTS	N-CON and CON showed similar patterns of improvement for single-leg-hop test and RFD .
CONCLUSIONS	Nonconcurrent strength and cardiovascular-endurance conditioning during @ wk of rehabilitation after ACI surgery elicited significantly greater improvements to functional and neuromuscular outcomes than did contemporary concurrent rehabilitation .

OBJECTIVE	The authors examine the pattern of direction errors made during the manipulation of a physical simulation of an underground coal mine bolting machine to assess the directional control-response compatibility relationships associated with the device and to compare these results to data obtained from a virtual simulation of a generic device .
BACKGROUND	Directional errors during the manual control of underground coal roof bolting equipment are associated with serious injuries .
BACKGROUND	Directional control-response relationships have previously been examined using a virtual simulation of a generic device ; however , the applicability of these results to a specific physical device may be questioned .
METHODS	Forty-eight participants randomly assigned to different directional control-response relationships manipulated horizontal or vertical control levers to move a simulated bolter arm in three directions ( elevation , slew , and sump ) as well as to cause a light to become illuminated and raise or lower a stabilizing jack .
METHODS	Directional errors were recorded during the completion of @ trials by each participant
RESULTS	Directional error rates are increased when the control and response are in opposite directions or if the direction of the control and response are perpendicular.The pattern of direction error rates was consistent with experiments obtained from a generic device in a virtual environment .
CONCLUSIONS	Error rates are increased by incompatible directional control-response relationships .
CONCLUSIONS	Ensuring that the design of equipment controls maintains compatible directional control-response relationships has potential to reduce the errors made in high-risk situations , such as underground coal mining .

OBJECTIVE	This article illustrates the use of mixed methods in the development and evaluation of the Positive Online Weight Reduction ( POWeR ) programme , an e-health intervention designed to support sustainable weight loss .
OBJECTIVE	The studies outlined also explore how human support might enhance intervention usage and weight loss .
METHODS	Mixed methods were used to develop and evaluate POWeR .
METHODS	In the development phase , we drew on both quantitative and qualitative findings to plan and gain feedback on the intervention .
METHODS	Next , a feasibility trial , with nested qualitative study , explored what level of human support might lead to the most sustainable weight loss .
METHODS	Finally , a large community-based trial of POWeR , with nested qualitative study , explored whether the addition of brief telephone coaching enhances usage .
RESULTS	Findings suggest that POWeR is acceptable and potentially effective .
RESULTS	Providing human support enhanced usage in our trials , but was not unproblematic .
RESULTS	Interestingly , there were some indications that more basic ( brief ) human support may produce more sustainable weight loss outcomes than more regular support .
RESULTS	Qualitative interviews suggested that more regular support might foster reliance , meaning patients can not sustain their weight losses when support ends .
RESULTS	Qualitative findings in the community trial also suggested explanations for why many people may not take up the opportunity for human support .
CONCLUSIONS	Integrating findings from both our qualitative and quantitative studies provided far richer insights than would have been gained using only a single method of inquiry .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research should investigate the optimum delivery of human support needed to maximize sustainable weight loss in online interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ?
CONCLUSIONS	There is evidence that human support may increase the effectiveness of e-health interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	It is unclear what level of human support might be optimal or how human support improves effectiveness .
CONCLUSIONS	Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods can be used to inform the design and implementation of interventions What does this study add ?
CONCLUSIONS	This paper demonstrates the value of a mixed methods approach when developing and evaluating an intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Qualitative methods provided complementary insights into the optimal level of human support .
CONCLUSIONS	Brief human support is valued by some and may enhance usage and outcomes of an e-health intervention for weight loss .

OBJECTIVE	This study assessed whether the Venner-PneuX endotracheal tube ( ET ) system , which has sub-glottic suction as well as irrigation ports and continuous cuff-pressure monitoring , is associated with a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) when compared with the standard ET in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery .
METHODS	This was a single-institution , prospective , randomized control trial .
METHODS	Patients were categorized as either Group A ( Venner-PneuX ET tube , n = @ ) or Group B ( Standard ET tube , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria included patients over the age of @ years and/or impaired left ventricular function ( LVEF < @ % ) undergoing cardiac surgery .
METHODS	Patients were monitored for VAP for up to @ h post extubation and the diagnosis of VAP was according to the centres for disease control definition .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the patients ' demographics .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) ages for the two groups were @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) years ( P = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The mean EuroSCORE was @ ( @ ) for Group A and @ ( @ ) for Group B ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median intubation times were @ ( @ , @ ) h and @ ( @ , @ ) h , respectively .
RESULTS	VAP incidence was significantly lower in the Venner-PneuX ET group , being @ % when compared with @ % in the standard ET group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of intensive care unit stay ( P = @ ) and in-hospital mortality ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A binary logistic regression analysis ( type of ET tube , age , LVEF , history of lung disease , smoking history , surgical procedure , EuroSCORE , cardiopulmonary bypass time , blood transfusion , intubation duration among others ) confirmed that the Venner-PneuX ET tube was associated with significant VAP reduction ( Odds ratio @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The Venner-PneuX VAP prevention system is associated with a significant reduction in VAP .
CONCLUSIONS	This can potentially lead to significant cost reductions and should be implemented as part of the VAP reduction bundle .

OBJECTIVE	Treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants with continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) preserves surfactant and keeps the lung open but is insufficient in severe surfactant deficiency .
OBJECTIVE	Traditional surfactant administration is related to short periods of positive pressure ventilation and implies the risk of lung injury .
OBJECTIVE	CPAP with surfactant but without any positive pressure ventilation may work synergistically .
OBJECTIVE	This randomized trial investigated a less invasive surfactant application protocol ( LISA ) .
OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that LISA increases survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) at @ weeks ' gestational age in extremely preterm infants .
METHODS	The Nonintubated Surfactant Application trial was a multicenter , randomized , clinical , parallel-group study conducted between April @ , @ , and March @ , @ , in @ level III neonatal intensive care units in Germany .
METHODS	The final follow-up date was June @ , @ .
METHODS	Participants included @ of @ eligible ( @ % ) spontaneously breathing preterm infants born between @ and @ weeks ' gestational age with signs of respiratory distress syndrome .
METHODS	In an intention-to-treat design , infants were randomly assigned to receive surfactant either via a thin endotracheal catheter during CPAP-assisted spontaneous breathing ( intervention group ) or after conventional endotracheal intubation during mechanical ventilation ( control group ) .
METHODS	Analysis was conducted from September @ , @ , to June @ , @ .
METHODS	LISA via a thin catheter .
METHODS	Survival without BPD at @ weeks ' gestational age .
RESULTS	Of @ infants who were randomized , @ were randomized to the control group and @ to the LISA group .
RESULTS	Of the infants who received LISA , @ ( @ % ) survived without BPD compared with @ ( @ % ) of those in the control group .
RESULTS	The reduction in absolute risk was @ % ( @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Intervention group infants were less frequently intubated ( @ infants -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P < @ ) and required fewer days of mechanical ventilation .
RESULTS	Significant reductions were seen in pneumothorax ( @ of @ intervention group infants -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ of @ @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) and severe intraventricular hemorrhage ( @ infants -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) , and the combined survival without severe adverse events was increased in the intervention group ( @ infants -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ; absolute risk reduction , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	LISA did not increase survival without BPD but was associated with increased survival without major complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Because major complications are related to lifelong disabilities , LISA may be a promising therapy for extremely preterm infants .

BACKGROUND	Alcohol misuse in England costs around @ billion ( US$ @ billion ) annually from lost productivity and absenteeism .
BACKGROUND	Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable , particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour .
BACKGROUND	Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak .
BACKGROUND	The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption , delivered in a workplace as part of a health check .
RESULTS	This two-group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK-based private sector organisation ( approx .
RESULTS	@,@ employees ) .
RESULTS	@,@ employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period .
RESULTS	Of these , @,@ ( @ % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT-C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = @ ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Participants were mostly male ( @ % ) , with a median age of @ years and half were in managerial positions ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Median Body Mass Index was @ , @ % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate/vigorous physical activity a week was @ minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day .
RESULTS	Eighty percent ( n = @,@ ) of participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three months .
RESULTS	An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking ( primary outcome ) ( @ % increase associated with the intervention ( @ % CI -@ % to @ % ; p = @ ) ) , AUDIT ( measure of alcohol-related harm ) and health utility ( EQ-@D ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed on how to engage a larger proportion of employees in screening .

BACKGROUND	The purposes of this study were to compare the oxygen cost , metabolic parameters and temporalspatial variables between barefoot and shod running in trained mid-forefoot runners .
METHODS	Experienced runners ( N. = @ ; @ years ; @ men ) performed two separate @ minute treadmill running bouts at ~ @ % of estimated maximal heart rate .
METHODS	Rate of oxygen consumption ( VO@ ) , energy cost , fuel use and heart rate ( HR ) were collected continuously using a portable gas analyzer .
METHODS	Three-dimensional motion capture was used to measure temporalspatial parameters .
RESULTS	Participants ran at a mean self-selected speed of @ m/s for both conditions , at intensities corresponding to mean HR values of @ bpm ( shod ) and @ bpm ( barefoot ) .
RESULTS	Steady State VO@ was not different between the shod and barefoot conditions ( @ @ mL/kg * min vs. @ mL/kg * min , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The total energy expended in the shod and barefoot conditions was @ kJ and @ kJ .
RESULTS	The average non-protein respiratory exchange ratios , proportions and amount of fat and carbohydrate used were not different between conditions .
RESULTS	Cadence was @ % higher and center of gravity vertical displacement was @ cm less for the barefoot condition ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In trained mid-forefoot runners experienced with barefoot running , there are not significant metabolic differences between shod and barefoot running conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	Barefoot running increases cadence and decreases foot contact time and vertical displacement .
CONCLUSIONS	Experienced participants were likely able to titrate kinematics to standardize energy output and fuel use for a given running distance and speed irrespective of shoe wear .

BACKGROUND	Clinical trials yielded conflicting data about the benefit of adding systemic corticosteroids for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia .
BACKGROUND	We assessed whether short-term corticosteroid treatment reduces time to clinical stability in patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia .
METHODS	In this double-blind , multicentre , randomised , placebo-controlled trial , we recruited patients aged @ years or older with community-acquired pneumonia from seven tertiary care hospitals in Switzerland within @ h of presentation .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ratio ) to receive either prednisone @ mg daily for @ days or placebo .
METHODS	The computer-generated randomisation was done with variable block sizes of four to six and stratified by study centre .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was time to clinical stability defined as time ( days ) until stable vital signs for at least @ h , and analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	From Dec @ , @ , to May @ , @ , of @ patients assessed for eligibility , @ patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone group ( n = @ ) or the placebo group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median time to clinical stability was shorter in the prednisone group ( @ days , IQR @-@ ) than in the placebo group ( @ days , @-@ ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Pneumonia-associated complications until day @ did not differ between groups ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the prednisone group and @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the placebo group ; odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The prednisone group had a higher incidence of in-hospital hyperglycaemia needing insulin treatment ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; OR @ , @ % CI @-@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Other adverse events compatible with corticosteroid use were rare and similar in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Prednisone treatment for @ days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital shortens time to clinical stability without an increase in complications .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding is relevant from a patient perspective and an important determinant of hospital costs and efficiency .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of two novel light sources for large area and full body application , providing polychromatic , non-thermal photobiomodulation ( PBM ) for improving skin feeling and appearance .
BACKGROUND	For non-thermal photorejuvenation , laser and LED light sources have been demonstrated to be safe and effective .
BACKGROUND	However , lasers and LEDs may offer some disadvantages because of dot-shaped ( punctiform ) emission characteristics and their narrow spectral bandwidths .
BACKGROUND	Because the action spectra for tissue regeneration and repair consist of more than one wavelength , we investigated if it is favorable to apply a polychromatic spectrum covering a broader spectral region for skin rejuvenation and repair .
METHODS	A total of @ volunteers participated in this prospective , randomized , and controlled study .
METHODS	Of these volunteers , @ subjects randomly assigned into four treatment groups were treated twice a week with either @-@ or @-@ nm polychromatic light ( normalized to @ J/cm ( @ ) in the range of @-@ nm ) and were compared with controls ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Irradiances and treatment durations varied in all treatment groups .
METHODS	The data collected at baseline and after @ sessions included blinded evaluations of clinical photography , ultrasonographic collagen density measurements , computerized digital profilometry , and an assessment of patient satisfaction .
RESULTS	The treated subjects experienced significantly improved skin complexion and skin feeling , profilometrically assessed skin roughness , and ultrasonographically measured collagen density .
RESULTS	The blinded clinical evaluation of photographs confirmed significant improvement in the intervention groups compared with the control .
CONCLUSIONS	Broadband polychromatic PBM showed no advantage over the red-light-only spectrum .
CONCLUSIONS	However , both novel light sources that have not been previously used for PBM have demonstrated efficacy and safety for skin rejuvenation and intradermal collagen increase when compared with controls .

OBJECTIVE	Colon cancers deficient in mismatch repair ( MMR ) may exhibit diminished expression of the DNA repair gene , MRE@ , as a consequence of contraction of a T@ mononucleotide tract .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigated MRE@ status and its association with prognosis , survival and drug response in patients with stage III colon cancer .
METHODS	Cancer and Leukemia Group B @ ( Alliance ) randomly assigned @,@ patients with stage III colon cancer to postoperative weekly adjuvant bolus @-fluorouracil/leucovorin ( FU/LV ) or irinotecan + FU/LV ( IFL ) , with @ year follow-up .
METHODS	Tumors from these patients were analyzed to determine stability of a T@ tract in the MRE@ gene .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was overall survival ( OS ) , and a secondary endpoint was disease-free survival ( DFS ) .
METHODS	Non-proportional hazards were addressed using time-dependent covariates in Cox analyses .
RESULTS	Of @ tumor cases examined , @ ( @ % ) exhibited contraction at the T@ tract in one or both MRE@ alleles and were thus predicted to be deficient in MRE@ ( dMRE@ ) .
RESULTS	In pooled treatment analyses , dMRE@ patients showed initially reduced DFS and OS but improved long-term DFS and OS compared with patients with an intact MRE@ T@ tract .
RESULTS	In the subgroup of dMRE@ patients treated with IFL , an unexplained early increase in mortality but better long-term DFS than IFL-treated pMRE@ patients was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Analysis of this relatively small number of patients and events showed that the dMRE@ marker predicts better prognosis independent of treatment in the long-term .
CONCLUSIONS	In subgroup analyses , dMRE@ patients treated with irinotecan exhibited unexplained short-term mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	MRE@ status is readily assayed and may therefore prove to be a useful prognostic marker , provided that the results reported here for a relatively small number of patients can be generalized in independent analyses of larger numbers of samples .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the survival effects of inferior vena cava filters in patients with venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) who had a significant bleeding risk .
BACKGROUND	The effectiveness of inferior vena cava filter use among patients with acute symptomatic VTE and known significant bleeding risk remains unclear .
METHODS	In this prospective cohort study of patients with acute VTE identified from the RIETE ( Computerized Registry of Patients With Venous Thromboembolism ) , we assessed the association between inferior vena cava filter insertion for known significant bleeding risk and the outcomes of all-cause mortality , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) - related mortality , and VTE rates through @ days after the initiation of VTE treatment .
METHODS	Propensity score matching was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a filter .
RESULTS	Of the @,@ eligible patients who had acute symptomatic VTE , @ underwent filter placement because of known significant bleeding risk .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients treated with a filter were matched with @ patients treated without a filter .
RESULTS	Propensity score-matched pairs showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower risk of all-cause death for filter insertion compared with no insertion ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The risk-adjusted PE-related mortality rate was lower for filter insertion than no insertion ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Risk-adjusted recurrent VTE rates were higher for filter insertion than for no insertion ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients presenting with VTE and with a significant bleeding risk , inferior vena cava filter insertion compared with anticoagulant therapy was associated with a lower risk of PE-related death and a higher risk of recurrent VTE .
CONCLUSIONS	However , study design limitations do not imply a causal relationship between filter insertion and outcome .

OBJECTIVE	Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation has increasingly been chosen as the primary ventilation mode in respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) in preterm infants .
OBJECTIVE	In order to further understand the application of various non-invasive positive pressure ventilation modes , we compared the advantages and disadvantages of three modes as a primary mode of ventilation in premature infants with RDS .
METHODS	From December @ to March @ , @ preterm infants with RDS who received intubation-pulmonary surfactant ( PS ) - extubation in our NICU were randomly divided ( by means of random number table ) into three groups based on the primary mode of ventilation : nasal continuous positive airway pressure -LSB- NCPAP , n = @ , male/female ratio was @/@ , mean gestational age ( GA ) was ( @ @ ) weeks , mean birth weight ( BW ) was ( @ @ ) g -RSB- , bi-level positive airway pressure -LSB- BiPAP , n = @ , male/female ratio was @/@ , GA was ( @ @ ) weeks , BW was ( @ @ ) g -RSB- , and synchronized bi-level positive airway pressure -LSB- SBiPAP , n = @ , male/female rate was @/@ , GA was ( @ @ ) weeks , BW was ( @ @ ) g -RSB- .
METHODS	Ventilation settings including FiO ( @ ) were adjusted according to transcutaneous SPO ( @ ) monitoring or blood gas analysis .
METHODS	Various settings and adverse events were recorded as well .
METHODS	The main parameter was the FiO ( @ ) at @ h post-positive-pressure ventilation .
METHODS	Statistical analyses were performed using ( @ ) test , rank sum test , one-way analysis of variance for least-significant difference value , paired-sample t-test , two related sample Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and Logistic regression .
RESULTS	The PaCO ( @ ) ( mmHg , @ mmHg = @ kPa ) , oxygen index ( OI ) at @-@ h , and FiO ( @ ) at @ h post-ventilation in BiPAP and SBiPAP groups were lower than that in NCPAP groups with significant difference ( @ @ and @ @ vs. @ @ , @ @ and @ @ vs. @ @ , @ @ and @ @ vs. @ @ ; F = @ , @ and @ ; P = @ , @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between BiPAP and SBiPAP groups .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference among three groups ( all P > @ ) in the following events : respiratory index ( RI ) at @-@ h post-ventilation , abdominal distension , period of non-invasive ventilation , ratio of intubation for invasive ventilation if failed noninvasive ventilation , air-leak syndrome , neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis , periventricular-intraventricular haemorrhage , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , retinopathy of prematurity , mortality rate after @ h of age or rate of abandon for discharge .
RESULTS	The independent risk factors for failure of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation were gender , gestational age , antepartum steroid at @ h before birth to @ d , and birth weight , with the OR ( @ % confidence interval ) being @ ( @ , @ ) , @ ( @ , @ ) , @ ( @ , @ @ ) , and @ ( @ , @ ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	As the primary mode of ventilation in premature infants with RDS , both BiPAP and SBiPAP are more beneficial than NCPAP in improving oxygenation and reducing CO ( @ ) retention without increasing the incidence of adverse events .

OBJECTIVE	We examined the impact of a prenatal exercise intervention on physical activity in @ women at risk for gestational diabetes mellitus .
METHODS	We randomized participants in the Behaviors Affecting Baby and You ( BABY ) Study , which took place from @ to @ , to either a @-week individually tailored , motivationally matched exercise intervention ( n = @ ) or to a comparison health and wellness intervention ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	We assessed physical activity with the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire .
METHODS	We used linear mixed models to evaluate the impact of the interventions on change in physical activity according to intensity and type , total walking , and sedentary behavior .
RESULTS	Compared with the health and wellness arm , the exercise arm had significantly greater increases in sports or exercise activity ( @ vs @ metabolic equivalent of task -LSB- MET -RSB- hours/week ; P < @ ) , and smaller declines in total activity ( -@ vs -@ MET hours/week ; P = @ ) and activities of moderate to vigorous intensity ( -@ vs -@ MET hours/week ; P = @ ) , and was more likely to achieve recommended guidelines for physical activity ( odds ratio = @ ; @ % confidence interval = @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings extend the previous literature by demonstrating the benefits of a clinically feasible exercise intervention in an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the increased risk of adverse maternal health outcomes in ethnic minority groups , these findings may have important implications for reducing health disparities .

BACKGROUND	A recent paper reported the outcomes of a study examining a new self-guided internet-delivered treatment , the Wellbeing Course , for symptoms of anxiety or depression .
BACKGROUND	This study found the intervention resulted in significant symptom reductions .
BACKGROUND	It also found that automated emails increased treatment completion and clinical improvements in a subsample with elevated anxiety and depression .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the clinical outcomes and the effect of automated emails at @ months post-treatment .
METHODS	Participants , who were randomly allocated to a Treatment Plus Automated Emails Group ( TEG ; n = @ ) , a standard Treatment Group ( TG ; n = @ ) or delayed-treatment Waitlist Control Group ( Control ; n = @ ) , were followed up at @ months post-treatment .
METHODS	Eighty-one percent , @ % and @ % of participants in the TEG , TG and treated Waitlist Control Group provided symptom data at @-month follow-up , respectively .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-@ Item Scale ( PHQ-@ ) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-@ Item Scale ( GAD-@ ) .
RESULTS	Significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed over time in both the TEG and TG ( Fs > @ , ps < @ ) these were sustained from post-treatment to @-month follow-up ( ps > @ ) , and were associated with large effect sizes .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences in symptoms were found between the TEG and TG at post-treatment , @-month or @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Previously reported symptom differences between TEG and TG participants with comorbid symptoms were no longer present at @-month follow-up ( ps > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall benefits of the Wellbeing Course were sustained at @-month follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	Although automated emails facilitated Course completion and reductions in symptoms for participants with comorbid anxiety and depression from pre-post treatment , these differences were no longer observed at @-month follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that automated emails promote more rapid treatment response for people with elevated and comorbid symptoms , but may not improve longer term outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the differential effect of a multifaceted intervention on hospital-based maternal mortality between patients with cesarean and vaginal delivery in low-resource settings .
METHODS	We reanalyzed the data from a major cluster-randomized controlled trial , QUARITE ( Quality of care , Risk management and technology in obstetrics ) .
METHODS	These subgroup analyses were not pre-specified and were treated as exploratory .
METHODS	The intervention consisted of an initial interactive workshop and quarterly educational clinically oriented and evidence-based outreach visits focused on maternal death reviews ( MDR ) and best practices implementation .
METHODS	The trial originally recruited @,@ patients who delivered in each of the @ participating hospitals in Mali and Senegal , between @ and @ .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was hospital-based maternal mortality .
METHODS	Subgroup-specific Odds Ratios ( ORs ) of maternal mortality were computed and tested for differential intervention effect using generalized linear mixed model between two subgroups ( cesarean : @,@ ; and vaginal delivery : @,@ ) .
RESULTS	The test for homogeneity of intervention effects on hospital-based maternal mortality among the two delivery mode subgroups was statistically significant ( p-value : @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared to the control , the adjusted OR of maternal mortality was @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) among women with cesarean delivery .
RESULTS	The intervention had no significant effect among women with vaginal delivery ( adjusted OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	This differential effect was particularly marked for district hospitals .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal deaths reviews and on-site training on emergency obstetric care may be more effective in reducing maternal mortality among high-risk women who need a cesarean section than among low-risk women with vaginal delivery .

BACKGROUND	Tuberculosis is a public health problem in Cameroon , just like in many other countries in the world .
BACKGROUND	The National Tuberculosis Control Programme ( PNLT ) put in place by the state , aims to fight tuberculosis through the implementation of international directives ( Directly Observed Treatment Short , DOTS ) .
BACKGROUND	Despite the deployment of this strategy across the world , its implementation is difficult in the context of low-resource countries .
BACKGROUND	Some expected results are not achieved .
BACKGROUND	In Cameroon , the cure rate for patients with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis ( TPM + ) after @ months is only about @ % , @ % below the target .
BACKGROUND	This is mainly due to poor patient adherence to treatment .
BACKGROUND	By relying on the potential of mobile Health , the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of SMS reminders on the cure rate of TPM + patients , measured using @-month bacilloscopy .
METHODS	This is a blinded , randomised controlled multicentre study carried out in Cameroon .
METHODS	The research hypothesis is that sending daily SMS messages to remind patients to take their prescribed tuberculosis medication , together with the standard DOTS strategy , will increase the cure rate from @ % ( control group : DOTS , no SMS intervention ) to @ % ( intervention group : DOTS , with SMS intervention ) in a group of new TPM + patients .
METHODS	In accordance with each treatment centre , the participants will be randomly allocated into the two groups using a computer program : the intervention group and the control group .
METHODS	A member of the research team will send daily SMS messages .
METHODS	Study data will be collected by health professionals involved in the care of patients .
METHODS	Data analysis will be done by the intention-to-treat method .
CONCLUSIONS	The achieving of expected outcomes by the PNLT through implementation of DOTS requires several challenges .
CONCLUSIONS	Although it has been demonstrated that the DOTS strategy is effective in the fight against tuberculosis , its application remains difficult in developing countries .
CONCLUSIONS	This study explores the potential of mHealth to support DOTS strategy .
CONCLUSIONS	It will gather new evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth-based interventions and SMS reminders in the improvement of treatment adherence and the cure rate of tuberculosis patients , especially in a low-resource country such as Cameroon .

BACKGROUND	Depression is common in nursing home ( NH ) patients with dementia , and often clustered with anxiety and other mood symptoms .
BACKGROUND	An association between pain and depressive symptoms has been reported , but the impact of pain management on depression and other mood symptoms has not been investigated .
OBJECTIVE	Secondary analyses of a cluster randomized clinical trial examine the response of dementia-related mood symptoms to a Stepwise Protocol of Treating Pain .
METHODS	Three-hundred fifty-two patients with moderate and severe dementia and significant behavioural disturbances , related to @ clusters ( i.e. clusters defined as single independent NH units ) in @ NHs of Western Norway , were included .
METHODS	All patients in the intervention group received individual daily pain treatment with paracetamol , extended release morphine , buprenorphine transdermal patch or pregabaline for @weeks , with additional follow-up assessment @weeks after completion of the intervention .
METHODS	Clusters randomized to control received usual treatment .
METHODS	A mood cluster consisting of depression , anxiety , sleep disorders , apathy and appetite items from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home ( NPI-NH ) was the primary outcome .
RESULTS	Analysed by Mann-Whitney U-tests , Stepwise Protocol of Treating Pain conferred significant benefit in treatment of the NPI-NH mood cluster ( F = @ , df = @ ; @ , p < @ ) and depression ( F = @ , df = @ ; @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Further analyses highlighted improvements in apathy ( F = @ , df = @ ; @ , p = @ ) , night-time behaviours ( F = @ , df = @ ; @ , p = @ ) , and appetite items ( F = @ , df = @ ; @ , p = @ ) , but not irritability ( p = @ ) and anxiety ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mood symptoms including depression significantly improved with pain treatment , emphasizing the importance of more rigorous treatment of pain in agitated people with dementia .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings have potentially immediate clinical relevance .

OBJECTIVE	In clinical trials where participants are likely to be able to distinguish between true and sham interventions , informing participants that they may receive a sham intervention increases the likelihood of participants ` breaking the blind ' and invalidating trial findings .
OBJECTIVE	The present study explored participants ' perceptions of the consent process in a sham controlled acupressure trial which did not explicitly indicate participants may receive a sham intervention .
METHODS	Nested qualitative study within a randomised sham controlled trial of acupressure wristbands for chemotherapy-related nausea .
METHODS	Convenience sample of @ patients participated in semi-structured interviews .
METHODS	Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim .
METHODS	Transcripts analysed thematically using framework analysis .
METHODS	Study conducted within three geographical sites in the UK : Manchester , Liverpool , and Plymouth .
RESULTS	All participants indicated that they believed they were fully informed when providing written consent to participate in the trial .
RESULTS	Participants ' perceived it was acceptable to employ a sham intervention within the trial of acupressure wristbands without informing potential participants that they may receive a sham treatment .
RESULTS	Despite the fact that participants were not informed that one of the treatment arms was a sham intervention the majority indicated they assumed one of the treatment arms would be placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Many trials of acupuncture and acupressure do not inform participants they may receive a sham intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	The current study indicates patients ' perceive this approach to the consent process as acceptable .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the fact participants assume one treatment may be placebo threatens the methodological basis for utilising this approach to the consent process .

BACKGROUND	Bipolar disorder ( BD ) and borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) both are severe and chronic psychiatric disorders .
BACKGROUND	Both disorders have overlapping symptoms , and current research shows that the presence of a BPD has an adverse effect on the course of BD .
BACKGROUND	The limited research available shows an unfavorable illness course , a worse prognosis and response to medication , longer treatment duration , more frequent psychiatric admissions , higher drop-out , increased risk of substance abuse , increased risk of suicide , and more impairment of social and occupational functioning .
BACKGROUND	However , there is no research available on the effect of specific psychotherapeutic treatment for this patients .
METHODS	This paper presents the protocol of a RCT to investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD ( study part @ ) and the effectiveness of STEPPS ( Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving ) added to treatment as usual ( TAU ) for BD compared to TAU in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features ( study part @ ) .
METHODS	STEPPS is a validated and effective intervention for BPD .
METHODS	The study population consists of patients treated for BD at specialized outpatient clinics for BD in the Netherlands .
METHODS	At first the prevalence of comorbid borderline personality features in outpatients with BD is investigated .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria for study part @ is defined as having three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of BPD , including impulsivity and anger bursts .
METHODS	Primary outcomes will be the frequency and severity of manic and depressive recurrences as well as severity , course and burden of borderline personality features .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will be quality of life , utilizing mental healthcare and psychopathologic symptoms not primarily related to BD or BPD .
METHODS	Assessment will be at baseline , at the end of the intervention , and at @ and @ months follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features .
CONCLUSIONS	There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity .
CONCLUSIONS	We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients .

BACKGROUND	Although serum under-O-glycosylated IgA@ in IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) patients may deposit more preferentially in glomeruli than heavily-O-glycosylated IgA@ , the relationship between the glomerular IgA deposition level and the O-glycan profiles of serum IgA@ remains obscure .
METHODS	Serum total under-O-glycosylated IgA@ levels were quantified in @ IgAN patients by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with Helix aspersa ( HAA ) lectin .
METHODS	Serum under-O-glycosylated polymeric IgA@ ( pIgA@ ) was selectively measured by an original method using mouse Fc / receptor ( mFc/R ) transfectant and flow cytometry ( pIgA@ trap ) .
METHODS	The percentage area of IgA deposition in the whole glomeruli ( Area-IgA ) was quantified by image analysis on the immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens .
METHODS	Correlations were assessed between the Area-IgA and data from HAA-ELISA or pIgA@ trap .
METHODS	The relationships between clinical parameters and data from HAA-ELISA or pIgA@ trap were analyzed by data mining approach .
RESULTS	While the under-O-glycosylated IgA@ levels in IgAN patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls when measured ( p < @ ) , there was no significant difference in under-O-glycosylated pIgA@ .
RESULTS	There was neither a correlation observed between the data from HAA-ELISA and pIgA@ trap ( r@ = @ ) in the IgAN patients ( r@ = @ ) nor was there a linear correlation between Area-IgA and data from HAA-ELISA or the pIgA@ trap ( r@ = @ , @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Contour plots of clinical parameters versus data from HAA-ELISA and the pIgA@ trap revealed that patients with a high score in each clinical parameter concentrated in specific areas , showing that patients with specific O-glycan profiles of IgA@ have similar clinical parameters .
RESULTS	A decision tree analysis suggested that dominant immune complexes in glomeruli were consisted of : @ ) IgA@-IgG and complements , @ ) pIgA@ and complements , and @ ) monomeric IgA@-IgA or aggregated monomeric IgA@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Serum under-O-glycosylated IgA@ levels are not correlated with glomerular IgA deposition based upon heterogeneity in the composition of glomerular immune complexes in IgAN patients .

BACKGROUND	A relationship between echolucency of carotid plaques and the consequent risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke has been observed .
BACKGROUND	An aggressive lipid-lowering therapy may increase the echogenicity of carotid plaque in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the long-term effect of high-dose atorvastatin on carotid plaque morphology in patients with first-ever transient ischemic attack or stroke .
METHODS	All patients with symptomatic first ischemic atherosclerotic cerebrovascular event occurred within the previous @ days were enrolled .
METHODS	Carotid Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels with @-@ MHz probe for the definition of the atherosclerotic carotid framework was performed .
METHODS	The analysis of the gray-scale median ( GSM ) of each plate was carried out with image processing software .
RESULTS	A total of @ symptomatic plaques were included and divided into @ groups : @ in group A ( atorvastatin @ mg ) , @ in group B ( atorvastatin @ mg ) , and @ to group C ( no atorvastatin ) .
RESULTS	GSM score increases significantly more extensive in group A than in group B ( +@ vs. +@ , P < @ ) and group C ( +@ vs. @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	An inverse association between reduction of low-density lipoprotein and the increase in the GSM score ( r = -@ , P = @ ) has been observed .
RESULTS	Moreover , the reduction of high-sensitive C-reactive protein correlates inversely with the increase of the GSM ( r = -@ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dose-dependent effect of atorvastatin on symptomatic carotid plaque morphology may suggest a specific role of this drug in the atherosclerotic stroke prevention .

BACKGROUND	Although social support is an integral element in smoking cessation , the literature presents mixed findings regarding the type ( s ) of social support that are most helpful .
BACKGROUND	The Partner Interaction Questionnaire ( PIQ ) is commonly used to measure social support in this context .
OBJECTIVE	We explored the possibility that more nuanced distinctions between items on the PIQ than what is customarily used could improve the prediction of cessation .
METHODS	Baseline PIQ responses of smokers enrolled in a cessation program was submitted to an exploratory factor analysis .
METHODS	Emergent factors were used to predict cessation at several time points .
RESULTS	Four factors emerged , which differed from the two subscales that are typically used .
RESULTS	The four-factor version predicted cessation ; the two-factor version did not .
CONCLUSIONS	Identifying the types of social support that predict smoking cessation depend on our ability to measure social support .
CONCLUSIONS	More nuanced measures will likely clarify the role of social support in cessation .

OBJECTIVE	Previous studies have revealed lower prostate specific antigen concentrations in men with type @ diabetes , paralleling the reported lower prevalence of prostate cancer in diabetic men .
OBJECTIVE	Data are lacking on prostate specific antigen in men with type @ diabetes whose insulin and obesity profiles differ from those with type @ diabetes mellitus .
OBJECTIVE	In this study we examined the relationship between long-term glycemic control and prostate specific antigen in men with type @ diabetes mellitus .
METHODS	Total prostate specific antigen was measured at one time in @ men in the EDIC , the observational followup of participants in the DCCT .
METHODS	The relationship between DCCT/EDIC weighted mean hemoglobin A@c and log prostate specific antigen was assessed using linear regression modeling after adjusting for age , body mass index , total testosterone , statin and thiazide medication use , diabetes duration , and DCCT randomization arm and cohort .
RESULTS	Median subject age was @ years , body mass index was @ kg/m ( @ ) and DCCT/EDIC time-weighted hemoglobin A@c was @ % .
RESULTS	Median prostate specific antigen was @ ng/ml ( IQR @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Prostate specific antigen increased significantly with age ( p < @ ) and with lower time-weighted hemoglobin A@c ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Each @ % increase in hemoglobin A@c was accompanied by an @ % reduction in prostate specific antigen ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Prostate specific antigen decreases as hemoglobin A@c increases in men with type @ diabetes mellitus .
CONCLUSIONS	This relationship is independent of age , body mass index , androgen levels , medication use and measures of diabetes severity , which suggests that factors related to glycemia may directly affect prostate specific antigen levels .

BACKGROUND	To validate the association between accommodation and visual asthenopia by measuring objective accommodative amplitude with the Optical Quality Analysis System ( OQAS , Visiometrics , Terrassa , Spain ) , and to investigate associations among accommodation , ocular surface instability , and visual asthenopia while viewing @D displays .
METHODS	Fifteen normal adults without any ocular disease or surgical history watched the same @D and @D displays for @ minutes .
METHODS	Accommodative ability , ocular protection index ( OPI ) , and total ocular symptom scores were evaluated before and after viewing the @D and @D displays .
METHODS	Accommodative ability was evaluated by the near point of accommodation ( NPA ) and OQAS to ensure reliability .
METHODS	The OPI was calculated by dividing the tear breakup time ( TBUT ) by the interblink interval ( IBI ) .
METHODS	The changes in accommodative ability , OPI , and total ocular symptom scores after viewing @D and @D displays were evaluated .
RESULTS	Accommodative ability evaluated by NPA and OQAS , OPI , and total ocular symptom scores changed significantly after @D viewing ( p = @ , @ , @ , and @ , respectively ) , but yielded no difference after @D viewing .
RESULTS	The objective measurement by OQAS verified the decrease of accommodative ability while viewing @D displays .
RESULTS	The change of NPA , OPI , and total ocular symptom scores after @D viewing had a significant correlation ( p < @ ) , implying direct associations among these factors .
CONCLUSIONS	The decrease of accommodative ability after @D viewing was validated by both subjective and objective methods in our study .
CONCLUSIONS	Further , the deterioration of accommodative ability and ocular surface stability may be causative factors of visual asthenopia in individuals viewing @D displays .

OBJECTIVE	Vitamin D insufficiency is common in subjects with type @ diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	Observational studies suggest that vitamin D plays a role in the pathogenesis of type @ diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	However , results of intervention studies have been inconsistent .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effects of improving vitamin D status on insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion , and inflammatory markers in patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	A double blind , randomized , placebo controlled trial was conducted .
METHODS	Sixteen patients with type @ diabetes and hypovitaminosis D were recruited .
METHODS	Eight patients received colecalciferol and ( @ g daily for @ weeks , @ g daily for @ weeks ) and @ patients received identical placebo tablets for @ weeks .
METHODS	Before and after intervention , patients underwent IVGTT , hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp , assessment of baseline high-frequency insulin pulsatility , glucose-entrained insulin pulsatility , DXA scans , @-hour-ambulatory blood pressure monitorings , and fasting blood samples .
RESULTS	Serum-@ ( OH ) vitamin D and serum-@ ,@ ( OH ) vitamin D increased significantly after @ weeks in the intervention group ( p = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum-@ ( OH ) vitamin D was also significantly higher in the vitamin D group compared to the placebo group ( p = @ ) after intervention .
RESULTS	Although no significant changes in insulin sensitivity , inflammation , blood pressure , lipid profile , or HbA@c were found , we observed borderline ( p between @ and @ ) improvements of insulin secretion , in terms of c-peptide levels , first phase incremental AUC insulin and insulin secretory burst mass .
CONCLUSIONS	Improvement in vitamin D status does not improve insulin resistance , blood pressure , inflammation or HbA@c , but might increase insulin secretion in patients with established type @ diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated acute bone turnover marker ( BTM ) responses to high-intensity resistance exercise with and without whole-body vibration ( WBV ) in young men ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	In this randomized crossover study , subjects performed @ protocols separated by @-week wash out periods : @ ) resistance exercise only ( RE ) ( @ sets @ repetitions @ % @RM for @ exercises ) ; and @ ) WBV + RE ( side-alternating vibration platform @ intermittent , @-minute bouts @ Hz , @ mm peak-to-peak displacement followed by RE ) .
METHODS	Fasting morning blood draws were taken before RE or WBV ( PRE ) , immediately post RE ( IP ) , and @ minutes post RE ( @P ) .
METHODS	WBV + RE also had a blood draw after the WBV exposure ( POST WBV ) .
METHODS	Blood samples were analyzed for lactate , hematocrit , bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( Bone ALP , U/L ) , C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ( CTX-I , ng/mL ) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase @b ( TRAP@b , U/L ) .
RESULTS	Lactate , hematocrit , and Bone ALP significantly increased ( p < @ ) IP for both protocols .
RESULTS	Bone resorption markers did not change during RE only .
RESULTS	CTX-I significantly decreased POST WBV .
RESULTS	TRAP@b increased POST WBV , then significantly decreased at @P .
CONCLUSIONS	Generally , BTM changes to RE only were not significant when adjusted for hemoconcentration .
CONCLUSIONS	The WBV stimulus altered bone resorption marker but not bone formation marker responses .

BACKGROUND	Intubation in patients with suspected cervical spine injury must be cautiously performed to avoid any further neurologic trauma .
BACKGROUND	Several intubation techniques have been introduced to minimize cervical spine motion such as the use of the videolaryngoscope .
OBJECTIVE	The present study aims to compare the movement of the cervical spine during intubation by using McGrath series @ videolaryngoscope ( MGL ) and that of the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope from cinefluoroscopic imaging .
METHODS	Twenty-two patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery that did not involve cervical spine procedure and required general anesthesia were recruited into the study .
METHODS	All patients were randomized either to have intubation with MGL ( n = @ ) or Macintosh laryngoscope ( n = @ ) in a neutral position with manual in-line stabilization ( MILS ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the cervical vertebral angle changes pre - and post-intubation , measured by cinefluoroscopy .
METHODS	The number of intubation attempts , the laryngoscopic view , the time to intubation , and the incidence ofany complications were recorded as well .
RESULTS	Eleven patients were included in each group without any exclusion from the study .
RESULTS	The cervical vertebral angle changes pre - and post-intubation with the MGL was less than with the Macintosh laryngoscope at C@/@ ( @ vs. @ degrees , respectively ; p-value = @ ) and the cumulative changes of all cervical spine levels ( @ vs. @ degrees , respectively ; p-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the time to intubation with the MGL was longer ( @ vs. @ seconds , p-value = @ ) , the laryngoscope view was better .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in the intubation success rate , the number of attempts , and the incidence of complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Orotracheal intubation with MGL provided less cervical spine motion and improved visualization of the vocal cords , without causing adverse consequences as compared with Macintosh laryngoscope and MILS .

BACKGROUND	There is limited evidence with regard to the effect of different sources of protein on appetite during weight loss .
BACKGROUND	Vegetarian and meat-based high-protein diets may have contrasting effects on appetite and biomarkers of protein-induced satiety .
OBJECTIVE	The aim was to assess appetite response to meat or vegetarian high-protein weight-loss ( HPWL ) diets in obese men to monitor plasma amino acid profile and gut peptide response as potential satiety biomarkers .
METHODS	Twenty obese -LSB- body mass index ( in kg/m ) : @ -RSB- men participated in a dietary intervention study .
METHODS	After @ d of a maintenance diet , they were provided in a crossover design with either a vegetarian HPWL ( Soy-HPWL ) or a meat-based HPWL ( Meat-HPWL ) diet for @ wk .
METHODS	Both diets comprised @ % protein , @ % fat , and @ % carbohydrate , provided to measured resting metabolic rate .
METHODS	Body weight and the motivation to eat were measured daily .
METHODS	Plasma satiety biomarkers were collected during a test-meal challenge ( @ h ) at the end of each diet period .
RESULTS	Over the @ wk , subjects lost , on average , @ and @ kg with consumption of the Soy - and Meat-HPWL diets , respectively -LSB- P = @ ; SE of the difference ( SED ) : @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	ANOVA confirmed that subjectively rated hunger ( P = @ ; SED : @ ) , fullness ( P = @ ; SED : @ ) , desire to eat ( P = @ ; SED : @ ) , preservation of lean body mass ( P = @ ; SED : @ ) , and loss of percentage fat mass ( P = @ ; SED : @ ) did not differ between the @ HPWL diets .
RESULTS	There were differences in absolute concentrations of ghrelin and peptide YY between the @ HPWL diets , although the response as net area under the curve was not different .
CONCLUSIONS	Appetite control and weight loss were similar for both HPWL diets .
CONCLUSIONS	Gut hormone profile was similar between the diets , which suggests that vegetarian diets can be as effective as meat-based diets for appetite control during weight loss .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of co-ingesting caffeine ( CAF ) and carbohydrate ( CHO ) on high-intensity intermittent sprints ( HIS ) performance and physiological responses .
METHODS	Twelve active males underwent @ interventions at least @days apart in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , balanced trial .
METHODS	A meal contained @ % CHO was provided @h before the HIS test .
METHODS	Participants ingested the placebo ( PLA ) or CAF ( @mgkg ( -@ ) BW ) @h before taking an HIS test , and ingested a PLA or CHO solution ( @ gkg ( -@ ) BW ) before undergoing the testing protocol .
METHODS	The HIS protocol comprised ten sets of @-s sprints on a cycle ergometer with a @-min recovery between each set .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between peak power output and mean power output between trials ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with PLA , CAF+CHO resulted in a @ % reduction in total work , corresponding to a @-@ @ % increase in fatigue at the end stage of the HIS .
RESULTS	The administration of CAF+CHO supplementation also resulted in an @ % increase in blood lactate , and elevated blood glucose concentrations throughout HIS testing compared with PLA ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Cortisol concentrations also increased with CAF+CHO intake compared with PLA ; however , there was no significant effect of CAF+CHO supplementation on testosterone concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Co-ingestion of CAF and CHO did not improve high-intensity sprint cycling performance or reduce fatigue in active males .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , combined CAF and CHO supplementation might facilitate catabolism during prolonged high-intensity intermittent exercise .

BACKGROUND	Transversus abdominis plane block ( TAPB ) has emerged as a safe and effective regional anesthesia technique for providing postoperative lower abdominal analgesia .
BACKGROUND	Complications associated with TAPB are rare and pose a lower overall risk to the patient receiving a TAPB versus a caudal block , which is considered the gold standard for pediatric lower abdominal regional anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	Our study hypothesis was that TAPB would initially be equivalent to caudal block in providing postoperative pain control but would also show improved pain relief beyond the anticipated caudal duration .
METHODS	This study was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Forty-five children between the ages of @ and @ undergoing bilateral ureteral reimplantation surgery through a low transverse incision were enrolled .
METHODS	Narcotic requirement , pain scores ( FLACC/Wong-Baker FACES ) , episodes of emesis , and antispasmodic requirement were recorded in the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) and at @-hour intervals for @ hours from the time of block placement .
METHODS	Our protocol used a multimodal approach toward pain management in all children , including randomized regional technique , scheduled ketorolac , morphine as needed , and the antispasmodic , oxybutynin , as needed .
RESULTS	Morphine requirement showed no statistical difference during the initial @ hours ( all P @ at PACU , @ and @ hours ) .
RESULTS	However , at @ hours those patients randomized to receive the TAPB required less cumulative morphine than the caudal group ( @ mg/kg @ vs @ mg/kg @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a trend toward fewer episodes of emesis in the TAPB group which reached statistical significance at @ and @ hours ( @ vs @ episodes , P = @ ; and @ vs @ episodes , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pain scores ( @-@ ) were higher in the TAPB group in the PACU ( @ @ vs @ @ , P = @ ) , but there were no significant differences at all subsequent time points ( all P @ ) .
RESULTS	The TAPB group also had a higher requirement for the bladder antispasmodic oxybutynin at @ hours ( @ @ vs @ @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	TAPB provided superior analgesia compared with the caudal block at @ to @ hours after block placement , as demonstrated by a statistically significant decrease in cumulative opioid requirement , which was the primary end point .
CONCLUSIONS	The lower incidence of emesis in the TAPB group likely reflected the decreased opioid consumption .
CONCLUSIONS	Although TAPB appears to be less effective than the caudal block in preventing viscerally mediated bladder spasms , as evidenced by the higher PACU pain scores and increased oxybutynin requirement at @ hours , this effect may be counteracted in future clinical practice by scheduled administration of the antispasmodic medications .
CONCLUSIONS	Considering the overall safety advantages of the TAPB over the caudal block , this should be considered a preferred regional technique for lower abdominal surgeries .

BACKGROUND	We investigated the effects of anakinra , an interleukin-@ receptor antagonist , on coronary and left ventricular function in coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patients with rheumatoid arthritis .
RESULTS	In a double-blind crossover trial , @ patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( @ with CAD and @ without ) were randomized to a single injection of anakinra or placebo and after @ hours to the alternative treatment .
RESULTS	At baseline and @ hours after treatment , we assessed ( @ ) flow-mediated dilation of brachial artery ; ( @ ) coronary flow reserve , ejection fraction , systemic arterial compliance , and resistance by echocardiography ; ( @ ) left ventricular global longitudinal and circumferential strain , peak twisting , untwisting velocity by speckle tracking ; and ( @ ) interleukin-@ , nitrotyrosine , malondialdehyde , protein carbonyl , and Fas/Fas ligand levels .
RESULTS	At baseline , patients with CAD had @-fold higher interleukin-@ , protein carbonyl , higher nitrotyrosine , malondialdehyde , and Fas/Fas ligand than non-CAD ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	After anakinra , there was a greater improvement of flow-mediated dilation ( @ % versus @ % ) , coronary flow reserve ( @ % versus @ % ) , arterial compliance ( @ % versus @ % ) , resistance ( -@ % versus @ % ) , longitudinal strain ( @ % versus @ % ) , circumferential strain ( @ % versus @ % ) , peak twisting ( @ % versus @ % ) , untwisting velocity ( @ % versus @ % ) , ejection fraction ( @ % versus @ % ) , apoptotic and oxidative markers , and , in particular , of protein carbonyl ( @ % versus @ % ) in CAD than in non-CAD patients ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No changes in the examined markers were observed after placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Interleukin-@ inhibition causes a greater improvement in endothelial , coronary aortic function in addition to left ventricular myocardial deformation and twisting in rheumatoid arthritis patients with CAD than in those without .

BACKGROUND	Preoperative short-term radiotherapy ( PRT ) in combination with total mesorectal excision ( TME ) has shown to improve local control in rectal cancer treatment , however without a survival benefit and at the cost of increased morbidity .
BACKGROUND	The current study investigates the long-term health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) of patients @ years after treatment in the Dutch TME trial .
METHODS	In the TME trial ( @-@ ) @ Dutch patients with rectal cancer were treated with TME and randomly assigned to PRT ( @ @ Gy ) .
METHODS	In @ HRQL was evaluated in surviving patients ( n = @ ) using a questionnaire combining EORTC QLQ-C@ , EORTC QLQ-CR@ and additional questions .
RESULTS	Results were obtained from @ patients ( @ % ) , with a median follow up of @ years .
RESULTS	PRT+TME patients without stoma reported more faecal leakage and higher stool frequency , resulting in increased need of pads .
RESULTS	Furthermore , irradiated males reported more erection problems .
RESULTS	However , radiotherapy did not have negative effects on overall functioning .
RESULTS	Compared with Dutch population , patients in both treatment arms reported a small decrease in overall functioning and males reported less sexual activity , interest and enjoyment and more erection difficulties .
RESULTS	Irradiated females reported more vaginal dryness and more pain at intercourse compared with Dutch population .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term HRQL evaluation shows that treatment-related symptoms are still present @ years after treatment for rectal cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Radiotherapy increased bowel dysfunction in patients without stoma .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the Dutch population , both groups reported increased sexual dysfunction .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite these treatment-related symptoms , there was no difference in overall functioning and global health between TME and PRT+TME .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the temporal changes in circulating levels of markers of extracellular cardiac matrix ( ECCM ) turnover and their relationship with infarct size ( IS ) , ejection fraction ( EF ) , and left ventricular ( LV ) volumes , determined by serial cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging in patients with first-time ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
RESULTS	Forty-two patients with a first-time STEMI , successfully revascularized by primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) had serum samples taken prior to pPCI , @ , @ days , @ months , and @ year following STEMI for the analysis of the markers of collagen synthesis , and collagen degradation .
RESULTS	Late enhancement and cine CMR was performed on Days @ , @ , @ months , and @-year post-STEMI .
RESULTS	There was a significant increase in type I collagen degradation following STEMI that was not accompanied by an increase in collagen type I synthesis until @ months and @ year .
RESULTS	In contrast to the delay in type I collagen synthesis , there was an immediate increase in type III collagen synthesis that was sustained for @ year .
RESULTS	N-terminal procollagen type I levels assessed prior to pPCI were predictive of adverse LV remodelling at all CMR time-points .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings indicate a net type I collagen breakdown in the first week following STEMI compensated by an early increase in collagen type III synthesis .
CONCLUSIONS	There is an increase in both type I and III collagen synthesis markers at @ months and @ year , indicating a persistent increase in collagen turnover even in these apparently successfully treated patients .

OBJECTIVE	Virtually all early cases of knee osteoarthritis have degenerative medial meniscus lesions accompanying the chondral defects on MRI .
OBJECTIVE	It is difficult to determine if the symptoms are caused by the unstable meniscus or by osteoarthritis , hence unclear guidance towards treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We , therefore , aimed to determine the clinical improvement following arthroscopic meniscectomy compared to intraarticular administration of corticosteroids for degenerative ruptures of the medial meniscus in the presence of early stage medial compartment knee osteoarthritis .
METHODS	We included @ consecutive cases of nontraumatic symptomatic knees which had degenerative lesions of the medial compartment ( cartilage and meniscus ) on MRI 's .
METHODS	They were randomized to receive either intraarticular steroid injection or arthroscopic debridement .
METHODS	We also analyzed the correlation between BMI , age , gender , MRI , intraoperative aspect of the meniscus and cartilage and clinical improvement using the Oxford Knee Score up to one year .
METHODS	At one month there was significant improvement of the scores for all the examined cases .
METHODS	Also at one month , the arthroscopic group performed better in terms of symptom improvement .
METHODS	This was maintained for @ % of the knees in the arthroscopic group and @ % in the intraarticular steroid injection respectively , out of those available for follow up at one year .
RESULTS	At one month , symptoms reappeared for @ patients in the steroid group and @ in the arthroscopy respectively .
RESULTS	Gender and age did not correlate with treatment , whereas extrusion of the meniscus , bone marrow edema , duration of the clinical symptoms , obesity and a low preoperative score were negative prognostic factors .
CONCLUSIONS	Degenerative medial meniscal tears , in the presence of osteoarthritis , can only marginally benefit from arthroscopic debridement over intraarticular steroid injections in short term follow up .
CONCLUSIONS	When considering individual cases , factors become more predictive when analyzed in group .

BACKGROUND	Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the working population and are associated with excessive costs .
BACKGROUND	The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited .
BACKGROUND	Treating employees with depressive symptoms before sick leave via the Internet could be beneficial and cost saving .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , we developed and tested the effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms .
OBJECTIVE	We report on the posttreatment effectiveness of the intervention .
METHODS	This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based guided self-help course to care as usual ( CAU ) .
METHODS	We recruited employees from @ different companies via the companies ' intranet and posters .
METHODS	The main inclusion criterion was elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score of @ on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale ( CES-D ) .
METHODS	The intervention ( Happy@Work ) was based on problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy and consisted of @ weekly lessons .
METHODS	Participants were asked to submit their weekly assignment via the website after completion .
METHODS	They subsequently received feedback from a coach via the website .
METHODS	Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms ( CES-D ; primary outcome ) , anxiety measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) , burnout measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory ( MBI ) , and work performance measured by the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire ( HPQ ; secondary outcomes ) were completed at baseline and at posttreatment .
RESULTS	A total of @ employees were randomized to either the intervention group ( n = @ ) or CAU ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The posttreatment assessment was completed by @ ( @ % ) participants .
RESULTS	Both the intervention and the CAU group showed significant improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptoms , but no differences between the conditions was found ( d = @ , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant but small effects in favor of the intervention group were found for anxiety symptoms ( d = @ , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ) and exhaustion ( d = @ , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study showed that a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms among employees than CAU .
CONCLUSIONS	Large improvements in depressive symptoms in the CAU group were unforeseen and potential explanations are discussed .

OBJECTIVE	Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection is characterised by a failure of virus-specific CD@ + T cells that is mainly caused by viral escape and T cell exhaustion .
OBJECTIVE	Constant antigen stimulation has been suggested to contribute to HCV-specific CD@ + T cell exhaustion .
OBJECTIVE	However , IFN-based therapies failed to recover HCV-specific CD@ + T cell function suggesting that the damage to CD@ + T cells may be permanent even after antigen removal .
OBJECTIVE	It was therefore the objective of this study to analyse the impact of inhibition of ongoing viral replication by IFN-free therapy with direct acting antivirals ( DAA ) on the phenotype and function of HCV-specific CD@ + T cells .
METHODS	Virus-specific CD@ + T cells obtained from a patient cohort of @ previously untreated chronically infected patients undergoing IFN-free therapy with a combination of faldaprevir ( a protease inhibitor ) and deleobuvir ( a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor ) with or without ribavirin were analysed ex vivo and after in vitro expansion at baseline , wk@ , wk @ , and after treatment .
RESULTS	Our results show the rapid restoration of proliferative HCV-specific CD@ + T cells in the majority of patients with SVR@ within @ weeks of therapy suggesting that IFN-free therapy mediated antigen removal may restore CD@ + T cell function .
CONCLUSIONS	This study indicates a specific restoration of proliferative HCV-specific CD@ + T cells under IFN-free therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	This is in contrast to PegIFN-based therapies that have been shown not to restore T cell function during and after chronic infection .

OBJECTIVE	Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunctions , which may be mediated by changes in adipose tissue signaling factors .
OBJECTIVE	These molecules are denoted as Adipose Tissue Generated Mediators of CardioVascular Risk ( ATGMCVR ) here , and include leptin , adiponectin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin @ ( IL-@ ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor @ ( PAI-@ ) .
OBJECTIVE	This study examined the effect of a weight loss program on ATGMCVR in obese adults with prediabetes .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to usual care ( UC ; n = @ ) or lifestyle weight loss groups ( LWL ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	LWL was a community-based weight loss intervention to promote physical activity and healthy eating .
METHODS	ATGMCVR at @-year were compared between groups by analysis of covariance ; baseline value of the mediator was the covariate .
METHODS	Baseline means for ATGMCVR were compared between those with ( n = @ ) and without ( n = @ ) metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) .
RESULTS	At baseline , subjects were @ ( SD ) years , @ % female , with a BMI of @kg/m ( @ ) .
RESULTS	One-year weight loss ( % ) was @ % for LWL and @ % for UC .
RESULTS	Group differences at @-year were noted ( adjusted means -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- for UC and LWL , respectively ) for adiponectin ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ; @,@ -LSB- @ , @,@ -RSB- ng/ml ; p = @ ) , leptin ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ; @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ng/ml ; p = @ ) , IL-@ ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ; @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- pg/ml ; p = @ ) , and PAI-@ ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ; @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- pg/ml ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences in baseline ATGMCVR were seen between subjects with and without MetS .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest ATGMCVR can be improved with weight loss ; larger studies are needed to determine if improvements in metabolic dysfunction are related to changes in ATGMCVR .

BACKGROUND	The blood glucose-lowering effects of - glucan from oats and barley depend on the amounts consumed and their rheological properties .
BACKGROUND	This has been recently challenged with growing evidence that the food matrix may also be an important factor in predicting its physiological response .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to examine the effects of varying doses of - glucan from oats and barley and added to a snack bar on postprandial glycemia .
METHODS	In a randomized crossover study , @ healthy males and females consumed one of @ snack bars containing @ ( control ) , @ , @ , and @ g of - glucan derived from oats or barley or @ white bread controls .
METHODS	All treatments contained @ g of available carbohydrate .
METHODS	Blood glucose concentrations were measured after ingestion of the treatments over @ hours .
RESULTS	Incorporation of @ to @ g of - glucan into snack bars had no additional glucose-lowering benefits irrespective of dose and source compared to the control bars ( @ g - glucan ) , suggesting that both the solid food matrix and composition of the bars may play a role in their effects on glycemic response .
RESULTS	All bars reduced blood glucose area under the curve ( AUC ) by an average of @ % ( p < @ ) compared to the mean of the @ white bread controls .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding - glucan from oats and barley to the snack bar formulation used in this study did not yield any additional benefits beyond the glucose-lowering effects of the snack bars themselves .

OBJECTIVE	A randomized clinical trial assessing the difference in quality of life and clinical outcomes between delayed and simultaneous phlebectomies in the context of endovenous truncal vein ablation .
BACKGROUND	Endovenous ablation has replaced open surgery as the treatment of choice for truncal varicose veins .
BACKGROUND	Timing of varicosity treatment is controversial with delayed and simultaneous pathways having studies advocating their benefits .
BACKGROUND	A previous small randomized study has shown improved outcomes for simultaneous treatment .
METHODS	Patients undergoing local anesthetic endovenous thermal ablation were randomized to either simultaneous phlebectomy or delayed varicosity treatment .
METHODS	Patients were reviewed at @ weeks , @ months , and @ year with clinical and quality of life scores completed , and were assessed at @ weeks for need for further varicosity intervention , which was completed with either ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy or local anesthetic phlebectomy .
METHODS	Duplex ultrasound assessment of the treated trunk was completed at @ months .
RESULTS	@ patients were successfully recruited and treated out of @ suitable patients from a screened population of @ .
RESULTS	Patients in the simultaneous group ( n = @ ) showed a significantly improved Venous Clinical Severity Score at all time points , @ % of the delayed group required further treatment compared with @ % of the simultaneous group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no deep vein thromboses , with @ superfificial venous thrombosis in each group .
CONCLUSIONS	Combined endovenous ablation and phlebectomy delivers improved clinical outcomes and a reduced need for further procedures , as well as early quality of life improvements .

OBJECTIVE	Although guidelines recommend in-person counseling before BRCA@/BRCA@ gene testing , genetic counseling is increasingly offered by telephone .
OBJECTIVE	As genomic testing becomes more common , evaluating alternative delivery approaches becomes increasingly salient .
OBJECTIVE	We tested whether telephone delivery of BRCA@/@ genetic counseling was noninferior to in-person delivery .
METHODS	Participants ( women age @ to @ years who did not have newly diagnosed or metastatic cancer and lived within a study site catchment area ) were randomly assigned to usual care ( UC ; n = @ ) or telephone counseling ( TC ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	UC participants received in-person pre - and post-test counseling ; TC participants completed all counseling by telephone .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were knowledge , satisfaction , decision conflict , distress , and quality of life ; secondary outcomes were equivalence of BRCA@/@ test uptake and costs of delivering TC versus UC .
RESULTS	TC was noninferior to UC on all primary outcomes .
RESULTS	At @ weeks after pretest counseling , knowledge ( d = @ ; lower bound of @ % CI , -@ ) , perceived stress ( d = -@ ; upper bound of @ % CI , @ ) , and satisfaction ( d = -@ ; lower bound of @ % CI , -@ ) had group differences and confidence intervals that did not cross their @-point noninferiority limits .
RESULTS	Decision conflict ( d = @ ; upper bound of @ % CI , @ ) and cancer distress ( d = -@ ; upper bound of @ % CI , @ ) did not cross their @-point noninferiority limit .
RESULTS	Results were comparable at @ months .
RESULTS	TC was not equivalent to UC on BRCA@/@ test uptake ( UC , @ % ; TC , @ % ) .
RESULTS	TC yielded cost savings of $ @ per patient .
CONCLUSIONS	Genetic counseling can be effectively and efficiently delivered via telephone to increase access and decrease costs .

OBJECTIVE	@ elementary schools in Santiago , Chile .
OBJECTIVE	Subjects .
OBJECTIVE	@-@y old low-income children ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Randomized controlled study ; @ intervention/@ control schools .
METHODS	We trained teachers to deliver nutrition contents and improve the quality of PE classes .
METHODS	We determined % healthy snacks brought from home , children 's nutrition knowledge , nutritional status , duration of PE classes , and % time in moderate/vigorous activity ( MVA ) .
METHODS	Effectiveness was determined by comparing BMI Z between intervention and control children using PROCMIXED .
RESULTS	% obesity increased in boys from both types of schools and in girls from control schools , while decreasing in girls from intervention schools ( all nonsignificant ) .
RESULTS	% class time in MVA declined ( @-@ @ ) while remaining unchanged ( @-@ @ % ) in classes conducted by untrained and trained teachers , respectively .
RESULTS	In boys , BMI Z declined ( @-@ @ ) and increased ( @-@ @ ) in intervention and control schools , respectively .
RESULTS	In girls , BMI Z remained unchanged in intervention schools , while increasing significantly in control schools ( @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Interaction group time was significant for boys ( P < @ ) and girls ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This intervention was effective in controlling obesity , but not preventing it .
CONCLUSIONS	Even though impact was small , results showed that when no intervention is implemented , obesity increases .

BACKGROUND	Although the potential benefits of @-dimensional ( @-D ) vs @-dimensional ( @-D ) and high-definition ( HD ) vs standard-definition ( SD ) endoscopic visualization have long been recognized in other surgical fields , such endoscopes are generally considered too large and bulky for use within the brain .
BACKGROUND	The recent development of @-D and HD neuroendoscopes may therefore herald improved depth perception , better appreciation of anatomic details , and improved overall surgical performance .
OBJECTIVE	To compare simultaneously the effectiveness of @-D vs @-D and HD vs SD neuroendoscopy .
METHODS	Ten novice neuroendoscopic surgeons were recruited from a university hospital .
METHODS	A preclinical randomized crossover study design was adopted to compare @-D vs @-D and HD vs SD neuroendoscopy .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were time to task completion and accuracy .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes were perceived task workload using the NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) Task Load Index and subjective impressions of the endoscopes using a @-point Likert scale .
RESULTS	Time to task completion was significantly shorter when using the @-D vs the @-D neuroendoscopy ( P = @ ) , and accuracy of probe placement was significantly greater when using the HD vs the SD neuroendoscopy ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	We found that @-D endoscopy significantly improved perceived depth perception ( P < @ ) , HD endoscopy significantly improved perceived image quality ( P < @ ) , and both improved participants ' overall impression ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Three-dimensional neuroendoscopy and HD neuroendoscopy have differing but complementary effects on surgical performance , suggesting that neither alone can completely compensate for the lack of the other .
CONCLUSIONS	There is therefore strong preclinical evidence to justify @-D HD neuroendoscopy .

OBJECTIVE	To present the safety and efficacy of intravitreal implants releasing @ g/day fluocinolone acetonide ( FAc ) in patients with chronic versus nonchronic diabetic macular edema ( DME ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess ocular characteristics , anatomic changes , and re-treatment and ancillary therapies that may explain the differential treatment effect seen with intravitreal implants releasing FAc @ g/day in patients with chronic and nonchronic DME .
OBJECTIVE	An overall benefit-to-risk assessment for the FAc @-g / day and FAc @-g / day doses has been reported previously .
METHODS	Preplanned subgroup analysis of chronic ( duration of diagnosis , @ years ) and nonchronic ( duration of diagnosis , < @ years ) DME in patients from @ randomized , sham injection-controlled , double-masked , multicenter clinical trials .
METHODS	Patients with persistent DME despite @ or more macular laser treatment were randomized @:@:@ to sham injection ( n = @ ) , FAc @ g/day ( n = @ ) , or FAc @ g/day ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Patients received study drug or sham injection and after @ weeks were eligible for rescue laser .
METHODS	Based on re-treatment criteria , additional masked study drug could be given after @ year .
METHODS	Percentage of patients with improvement of @ letters or more from baseline .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included other parameters of visual function and foveal thickness .
RESULTS	At month @ , the difference between FAc @ g/day and sham control in the percentage of patients who gained @ letters or more was significantly greater in chronic DME patients ( FAc @ g/day , @ % vs. sham , @ % ; P < @ ) , compared with patients with nonchronic DME ( FAc @ g/day , @ % vs. sham , @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The greater response in patients with chronic DME was not associated with baseline ocular characteristics , changes in anatomic features , or differences in re-treatment or ancillary therapies .
RESULTS	The ocular adverse event profile for FAc @ g/day was similar regardless of DME duration .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first published analysis correlating duration of diagnosis of DME with treatment effect .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with chronic DME , FAc @ g/day provides substantial visual benefit for up to @ years and would provide an option for patients who do not respond to other therapy .

BACKGROUND	Ischemic postconditioning ( PCON ) appears as a potentially beneficial tool in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the effect of PCON on microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) in STEMI patients and in an experimental swine model .
METHODS	A prospective randomized study in patients and an experimental study in swine were carried out in two university hospitals in Spain .
METHODS	@ consecutive STEMI patients were randomized to undergo primary angioplasty followed by PCON or primary angioplasty alone ( non-PCON ) .
METHODS	Using late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance , infarct size and MVO were quantified ( % of left ventricular mass ) .
METHODS	In swine , using an angioplasty balloon-induced anterior STEMI model , MVO was defined as the % of area at risk without thioflavin-S staining .
RESULTS	In patients , PCON ( n = @ ) in comparison with non-PCON ( n = @ ) did not significantly reduce MVO ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- % vs. @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- % p = @ ) or IS ( @ @ % vs. @ @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	MVO ( > @ segment in the @-segment model ) occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) PCON and in @/@ ( @ % ) non-PCON patients , p = @ .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between PCON and non-PCON patients in left ventricular volumes , ejection fraction or the extent of hemorrhage .
RESULTS	In the swine model , MVO occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) PCON and in @/@ ( @ % ) non-PCON pigs , p = @ .
RESULTS	The extent of MVO ( @ @ % vs. @ @ % , p = @ ) and infarct size ( @ @ % vs. @ @ % , p = @ ) was not reduced in PCON compared with non-PCON pigs .
CONCLUSIONS	Ischemic postconditioning does not significantly reduce microvascular obstruction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction .

BACKGROUND	Sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions may benefit a variety of psychiatric disorders , including addiction .
BACKGROUND	Though ketamine engenders transient alterations in consciousness , it is not known whether these alterations influence efficacy .
BACKGROUND	This analysis evaluates the mystical-type effects of ketamine , which may have therapeutic potential according to prior research , and assesses whether these effects mediate improvements in dependence-related deficits , @h postinfusion .
METHODS	Eight cocaine dependent individuals completed this double-blind , randomized , inpatient study .
METHODS	Three counter-balanced infusions separated by @h were received : lorazepam ( @mg ) and two doses of ketamine ( @ mg/kg and @ mg/kg , with the former dose always preceding the latter ) .
METHODS	Infusions were followed within @min by measures of dissociation ( Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale : CADSS ) and mystical-type effects ( adapted from Hood 's Mysticism Scale : HMS ) .
METHODS	At baseline and @h postinfusion , participants underwent assessments of motivation to stop cocaine ( University of Rhode Island Change Assessment ) and cue-induced craving ( by visual analogue scale for cocaine craving during cue exposure ) .
RESULTS	Ketamine led to significantly greater acute mystical-type effects ( by HMS ) relative to the active control lorazepam ; ketamine @ mg/kg was associated with significantly higher HMS scores than was the @ mg/kg dose .
RESULTS	HMS score , but not CADSS score , was found to mediate the effect of ketamine on motivation to quit cocaine @h postinfusion .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that psychological mechanisms may be involved in some of the anti-addiction benefits resulting from ketamine .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research can evaluate whether the psychoactive effects of ketamine influence improvements in larger samples .

BACKGROUND	Although facial hyperhidrosis has been frequently associated with a diminished quality of life , various conservative modalities for its management are still far from satisfactory .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the antiperspirant efficacy and safety of the topical glycopyrrolate on facial hyperhidrosis at specified posttreatment intervals .
METHODS	Thirty-nine patients with facial hyperhidrosis were enrolled and treated with @ % topical glycopyrrolate on one-half of the forehead , whereas the other half of the forehead was treated with a placebo .
METHODS	All patients applied topical glycopyrrolate or placebo once a day for nine successive days .
METHODS	Each evaluation included weighing sweat and assessing the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale ( HDSS ) score and any adverse effects .
RESULTS	Compared with the placebo-treated sides , topical glycopyrrolate-treated sides showed a reduction in the rate of sweat production at the forehead of @ @ % ( mean SD ) at @ min after the first application ( day @ ) , @ @ % at @ h after the first application ( day @ ) and @ @ % at @ h after eight additional successive daily applications ( day @ ) ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a little more decrease in HDSS score with the topical glycopyrrolate-treated half of the forehead , but the difference was not statistically significant ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were reported during the course of this study .
RESULTS	Only one patient developed a transient headache after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical glycopyrrolate application appears to be significantly effective and safe in reducing excessive facial perspiration .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the association between Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score and motor vehicle crash ( MVC ) risk in a large cohort of community-dwelling participants with cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) or diabetes mellitus .
METHODS	Prospective observational study .
METHODS	Participants enrolled in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global End Point Trial and Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease clinical trial , which included individuals aged @ and older with CVD or diabetes mellitus .
METHODS	Totally @,@ frequent drivers ( defined as driving at least once per week ) who had completed a baseline MMSE .
METHODS	Involvement in a MVC as the driver .
RESULTS	Baseline MMSE score was divided into four categories : @ , @-@ , @-@ , and < @ .
RESULTS	The median MMSE score was @ ( interquartile range @-@ ) , and @ ( @ % ) has a MMSE score of less than @ at baseline .
RESULTS	After a mean follow-up of @ years , @,@ ( @ % ) participants were drivers in a MVC .
RESULTS	Lower scores were not associated with future MVCs ( MMSE score @-@ , hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @-@ @ ) ; MMSE score @-@ , HR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; MMSE score < @ , HR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) on multivariable analysis .
RESULTS	A MVC within the previous @ years ( HR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) was the strongest predictor of future MVCs .
RESULTS	Other clinical factors associated with greater MVC risk were depression , falls within the previous year , sleep apnea , and lower baseline systolic blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	In a population of frequent drivers , the MMSE does not predict MVCs .
CONCLUSIONS	Other clinical factors have a stronger association with MVC risk .

BACKGROUND	Primary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstrual cramps without pelvic pathology .
BACKGROUND	The condition is highly prevalent among women and exerts negative effects on their quality of life .
BACKGROUND	Considering the evidence for anti-inflammatory properties of Boron , the present study aimed to determine the effects of Boron supplementation on the severity and duration of menstrual pain in female university students .
METHODS	This triple-blind randomized clinical trial study recruited @ university students .
METHODS	The participants were matched for the severity and duration of dysmenorrhea and randomly allocated into the case and control groups ( n = @ and @ , respectively ) .
METHODS	The case group consumed @ mg/day Boron from two days before the menstrual flow until its third day .
METHODS	The control group received placebo capsules ( similar to those distributed among the cases ) .
METHODS	All subjects were asked to take the capsules for two consecutive menstrual cycles .
METHODS	Pain severity ( measured on a visual analog scale ) and duration ( in hours ) were measured at baseline and during the two cycles .
RESULTS	The two groups had no significant differences in the severity and duration of pain at baseline .
RESULTS	After the intervention , however , the severity and duration of pain were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on our findings , Boron supplementation can reduce the severity and duration of menstrual pain through exerting anti-inflammatory effects .
CONCLUSIONS	In order to clarify the effects of Boron on dysmenorrhea , future studies are required to measure the levels of hormones and inflammatory biomarkers .

OBJECTIVE	The present study examined the impact of BP from childhood to mid-adulthood on retinal microvascular architecture .
METHODS	The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included children aged @-@ years , from five Finnish University cities , with participants chosen randomly from the national population registrar from those areas .
METHODS	The age of participants included in the current analyses in childhood ( @ ) ranged from three to nine years and in mid-adulthood ( @ ) ranged from @ to @ years ( complete data n = @ ) .
METHODS	Measures of retinal microvasculature architecture measured in adulthood included diameters , tortuosity , lengths , and LDR .
RESULTS	Regression analysis showed a strong negative association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar diameter ( standardized regression coefficient -LSB- -RSB- -@ ; p < @ ) and with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood ( = -@ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	For arteriolar tortuosity , there was a strong positive association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar tortuosity ( = @ ; p < @ ) and no association with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood ( = @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High BP in childhood and increased BP from childhood to adulthood impacts on retinal microvascular architecture in mid-adulthood .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate quantitative relationships between baseline Q-wave width and @-day outcomes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
BACKGROUND	Baseline Q-waves are useful in predicting clinical outcomes after MI .
METHODS	@ STEMI patients were assessed from a multi-centre study .
RESULTS	@ patients of the overall cohort had pathologic Q-waves .
RESULTS	The @-day mortality and the composite of mortality , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , or cardiogenic shock ( p < @ for both outcomes ) rose as Q-wave width increased .
RESULTS	After adapting a threshold @ms for inferior and @ms for lateral/apical MI in all patients ( n = @ ) with any measureable Q-wave we found hazard ratios ( HR ) for mortality ( HR : @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ) and the composite ( HR : @ , @ % CI ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	This improved reclassification of patients experiencing the composite endpoint versus the conventional definition ( net reclassification index ( NRI ) : @ , @ % CI ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ) and universal MI definition ( NRI : @ , @ % CI ( @-@ @ ) , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The width of the baseline Q-wave in STEMI adds prognostic value in predicting @-day clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	A threshold of @ms in inferior and @ms for lateral/apical MI enhances prognostic insight beyond current criteria .

BACKGROUND	The relationship between current asthma symptoms and rescue bronchodilator ( reliever ) use is uncertain , leading to different recommendations about the preferred reliever metric to use when assessing asthma control .
BACKGROUND	In a @-month randomized controlled trial of combination budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy versus combination budesonide/formoterol as maintenance treatment with albuterol as reliever , we measured inhaler use by electronic monitoring .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the agreement between current asthma symptoms and different metrics of albuterol use for patients randomly assigned to maintenance budesonide/formoterol treatment .
METHODS	Data on albuterol use were extracted for the @-day period before visit @ ( at week @ ) from @ adult patients with asthma .
METHODS	Current asthma symptoms were measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire-@ ( ACQ-@ ) score at the clinic visit .
RESULTS	The number of days of albuterol use , the average number of albuterol actuations/day , and the highest number of albuterol actuations/day in the @-week period were all positively associated with ACQ-@ score ( r = @-@ @ , P < @ ) and had moderate discrimination for well-controlled and not well-controlled asthma ( ACQ-@ scores @ and @ , respectively ) , with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of @ to @ and @ to @ , respectively .
RESULTS	Cut points of @ days of albuterol use , average albuterol use of @ actuation/day , and highest albuterol use of @ actuations/day in the @-week period had @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity , @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity , and @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity , respectively , for predicting an ACQ-@ @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings support the use of the number of days of albuterol use , the average number of albuterol actuations per day , and the highest number of albuterol actuations per day over a @-week period of observation as comparable markers of current asthma control .

BACKGROUND	Tenofovir has been associated with a decrease in bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
BACKGROUND	However , data on changes in BMD after discontinuing tenofovir are lacking .
METHODS	We performed a two-centre randomized pilot study in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients receiving tenofovir with osteopenia/osteoporosis ( OsteoTDF study , ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT @ ) .
METHODS	Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to switch from tenofovir to abacavir ( n = @ ) or to continue with tenofovir ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Changes in lumbar and total hip BMD were evaluated at Week @ from baseline .
RESULTS	Five patients discontinued the study ( three from the tenofovir group and two from the abacavir group ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were detected between the groups at Week @ ( P = @ for total hip and P = @ for lumbar spine ) .
RESULTS	However , hip BMD improved by @ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ( P = @ ) in the abacavir group and @ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ( P = @ ) in the tenofovir group .
RESULTS	Lumbar spine BMD varied by -@ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ( P @ ) in the abacavir group and -@ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ( P < @ ) in the tenofovir group .
CONCLUSIONS	Switching from tenofovir to abacavir led to a slight improvement in femoral BMD although no differences were detected between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger studies are necessary before firm recommendations can be made on the discontinuation of tenofovir in patients with a low BMD .

OBJECTIVE	Binaural interaction can be investigated using auditory evoked potentials .
OBJECTIVE	A binaural interaction component can be derived from the auditory brainstem response ( ABR-BIC ) and is considered evidence for binaural interaction at the level of the brainstem .
OBJECTIVE	Although click ABR-BIC has been investigated thoroughly , data on @ Hz tone-burst ( TB ) ABR-BICs are scarce .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , characteristics of click and @ Hz TB ABR-BICs are described .
OBJECTIVE	Furthermore , reliability of both click and @ Hz TB ABR-BIC are investigated .
METHODS	Eighteen normal hearing young adults ( eight women , ten men ) were included .
METHODS	ABRs were recorded in response to clicks and @ Hz TBs .
METHODS	ABR-BICs were derived by subtracting the binaural response from the sum of the monaural responses measured in opposite ears .
RESULTS	Good inter-rater reliability is obtained for both click and @ Hz TB ABR-BICs .
RESULTS	The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at a mean latency of @ ms ( SD @ ms ) .
RESULTS	Reliable @ Hz TB ABR-BIC are obtained with a mean latency of @ ms ( SD @ ms ) .
RESULTS	Amplitudes are larger for @ Hz TB ABR-BIC than for clicks .
CONCLUSIONS	The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at the downslope of wave V. Five hundred Hertz TB ABR-BIC is characterized by a broad positivity occurring at the level of wave V.
CONCLUSIONS	The ABR-BIC is a useful technique to investigate binaural interaction in certain populations .
CONCLUSIONS	Examples are bilateral hearing aid users , bilateral cochlear implant users and bimodal listeners .
CONCLUSIONS	The latter refers to the combination of unilateral cochlear implantation and contralateral residual hearing .
CONCLUSIONS	The majority of these patients have residual hearing in the low frequencies .
CONCLUSIONS	The current study suggests that @ Hz TB ABR-BIC may be a suitable technique to assess binaural interaction in this specific population of cochlear implant users .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the possible association between pressure pain sensitivity of the chest bone ( PPS ) and cardiovascular physiological factors related to persistent stress in connection with a three-month PPS-guided stress-reducing experimental intervention programme .
METHODS	Forty-two office workers with an elevated PPS ( @ arbitrary units ) as a sign of increased level of persistent stress , completed a single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	The active treatment was a PPS ( self-measurement ) - guided stress management programme .
METHODS	Primary endpoints : Blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) and work of the heart measured as Pressure-Rate-Product ( PRP ) ; Secondary endpoints : Other features of the metabolic syndrome .
RESULTS	PPS decreased and changes in PPS after the intervention period were significantly associated with HR , PRP , body mass index ( BMI ) and visceral fat index ( all correlation coefficients > @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared to the control cluster group , the active cluster group obtained a significant reduction in PPS , Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and total number of elevated risk factors ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	On an individual level , significant and clinically relevant between-group reductions were observed in respect to BP , HR , PRP , total and LDL cholesterol , and total number of elevated risk factors ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The stress intervention method applied in this study induced a decrease in PPS which was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in resting blood pressure , heart rate , work of the heart and serum cholesterols .

BACKGROUND	Benign essential blepharospasm ( BEB ) is characterized by progressive involuntary contractions of the protractor muscles , sometimes leading to a debilitating closure of the lids .
BACKGROUND	It is currently treated with the injection of botulinum neurotoxin A ( BoNT/A ) .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare @ BoNT/A preparations ( i.e. , Xeomin and Botox ) in the treatment of BEB .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , double-blinded split-face technique in @ patients already treated by Botox for BEB .
METHODS	Patients received the same medication to either side of the face for @ injections , and were then evaluated using subjective and objective measures .
METHODS	Blepharospasm Disability Index ( BSDI ) and Jankovic Rating Scale ( JRS ) were assessed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and paired t test .
METHODS	Patient preference and objective comparison of residual orbicularis strength and spasm were compared using a multinomial logistic regression model , a repeated-measures ANOVA , and a paired t test .
RESULTS	A paired t test showed no preference between Xeomin and Botox ( P = @ ) and demonstrated a tendency toward not having a preference for either medication ( P = @ vs Botox and P = @ vs Xeomin ) .
RESULTS	The regression model showed no effect of time on patient preference ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The ANOVA for BSDI scores did not reveal any difference between the @ medications as compared with baseline ( P = @ ) , nor did it demonstrate an effect of time on BSDI scores ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A paired t test found no difference between the @ scores ( P = @ ) at baseline .
RESULTS	There was no difference in JRS scores for either medication when compared with baseline ( P = @ ) , nor was there an effect of time on such scores ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was also no difference between the @ medications according to paired t test ( P = @ ) at baseline .
RESULTS	Baseline residual orbicularis strength was similar between the @ medications ( paired t test ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	ANOVA shows an effect of time on orbicularis strength ( P = @ ) , but no difference was seen at any of the @ visits ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Baseline spasm scores were similar between Botox and Xeomin ( paired Student t test ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The ANOVA shows no difference between both medications at any point in time ( P = @ ) , and that time had no effect on the efficacy of either treatment ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	No difference between Xeomin and Botox was detected in either subjective or objective measures for the treatment of BEB .

BACKGROUND	Co-morbid depression in HIV-positive patients on anti-retroviral ( ART ) treatment poses a public health threat .
BACKGROUND	It compromises treatment adherence and accelerates disease progression .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a group-based counselling intervention for depressed HIV-positive patients in primary health care ( PHC ) in South Africa using a task shifting approach .
METHODS	Using a randomized control design , @ HIV-positive patients with co-morbid depression were initially recruited .
METHODS	This reduced to @ in the final cohort .
METHODS	Participants were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ@ ) , Hopkins Symptom Checklist ( HSCL-@ ) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) at baseline and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	The intervention was adapted from a local group-based Interpersonal Therapy ( IPT ) intervention .
METHODS	Process evaluation interviews were held with the HIV counsellors who delivered the intervention and a sub-sample of participants .
RESULTS	Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed significantly greater improvement on depression scores on the PHQ@ in the intervention group compared to the control group .
RESULTS	A significant decline in the mean scores on the HSCL-@ was found for both groups although this was more pronounced for the intervention group .
RESULTS	There was no significant improvement in the MSPSS scores .
CONCLUSIONS	The small sample size of the final cohort affected the power of the study to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the MSPSS .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer term impact of the intervention is unknown .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary findings suggest that group-based counselling for depression in HIV-positive patients can potentially be effectively delivered by appropriately trained and supported lay HIV counsellors .
CONCLUSIONS	The need for a larger trial is indicated .

BACKGROUND	Antireflux therapy may lead to recovery of impaired mucosal integrity in gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patients as reflected by an increase in baseline impedance .
BACKGROUND	The study objective was to evaluate the effect of endoscopic fundoplication and proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) PPI therapy on baseline impedance and heartburn severity in GERD patients .
METHODS	Forty-seven GERD patients randomized to endoscopic fundoplication ( n = @ ) or PPI therapy ( n = @ ) , and @ healthy controls were included .
METHODS	Before randomization and @months after treatment , baseline impedance was obtained during @-h pH-impedance monitoring .
METHODS	Heartburn severity was evaluated using the GERD-HRQL questionnaire .
RESULTS	Before treatment , baseline impedance in GERD patients was lower than in healthy controls ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Antireflux therapy increased baseline impedance ( from @ -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- to @ -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) , however it only led to a partial recovery when compared to healthy controls ( @ -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The effect of both treatment options was not significantly different ( p = @ ) despite the increased number of non-acid reflux events in the PPI group .
RESULTS	No correlation was found between baseline impedance and GERD symptoms before or after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Reduction in acid reflux by endoscopic fundoplication or PPI therapy leads to an increase in baseline impedance in GERD patients , likely to reflect recovery of mucosal integrity .
CONCLUSIONS	The impact of non-acid reflux events on esophageal mucosal integrity may be limited as no difference in the increase in baseline impedance was observed after both treatment options .
CONCLUSIONS	The lack of association between impedance baseline and heartburn severity indicates that other factors may contribute to heartburn perception in GERD .

OBJECTIVE	Nitrate supplementation improves endurance exercise and single bouts of high-intensity activity , but its effect on repeated sprints is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	This study is the first to investigate the effects of acute dietary nitrate supplementation during a high-intensity intermittent-sprint test to exhaustion .
METHODS	Team-sport athletes ( @ male , age @ @ y , VO@max @ @ mL kg-@ min-@ ; @ female , age @ @ y , VO@max @ @ mL kg-@ min-@ ) were assigned to a double-blind , randomized , crossover design .
METHODS	Participants consumed @ mL of concentrated beetroot juice containing a minimum of @ g of nitrate ( NT ) or @ mL of placebo ( PL ) @ h before a repeated-sprint protocol involving repeated @-s sprints with @-s recovery on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion .
RESULTS	Fewer sprints ( NT = @ @ vs PL = @ @ , P = @ , d = @ ) and less total work ( NT = @ @ kJ vs PL = @ @ kJ , P = @ , d = @ ) were completed in NT relative to PL .
RESULTS	However there was no difference in overall mean power output or the mean power output for each individual @-s sprint .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that dietary nitrate is not beneficial for improving repeated-sprint performance , at least when such sprints are near-maximal and frequent in nature .
CONCLUSIONS	The lack of an effect of nitrate at near-maximal oxygen uptake supports the suggestion that at greater exercise intensities nitrate does not have an ergogenic effect .

BACKGROUND	Breakthrough cancer pain typically has a rapid onset and relatively short duration .
BACKGROUND	Due to this temporal profile , it may not be adequately relieved by oral opioid analgesics .
BACKGROUND	The sublingual fentanyl orally disintegrating tablet is a formulation by which fentanyl can be rapidly absorbed across the oral mucosa producing rapid-onset analgesia , and which may be effective for breakthrough pain treatment .
METHODS	A multicenter , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the sublingual fentanyl tablet at optimized doses for breakthrough pain treatment in cancer patients treated with strong opioid analgesics at fixed intervals .
METHODS	The optimal dose was determined by open-label dose titration .
METHODS	The efficacy and safety of a @-week extended treatment were also evaluated .
RESULTS	Eleven of @ subjects who received the sublingual fentanyl tablet experienced adverse drug reactions .
RESULTS	Common reactions were somnolence , constipation , nausea , and vomiting .
RESULTS	No serious adverse reactions occurred .
RESULTS	Sublingual fentanyl tablets at optimal doses and placebo were administered to @ subjects in a double-blinded manner .
RESULTS	A significant analgesic effect of the sublingual fentanyl tablet was present compared to placebo at @ min after administration .
RESULTS	The sublingual fentanyl tablet was also effective and safe during extended treatment , in which changes in basal opioid doses as well as sublingual fentanyl tablet doses were made as needed .
CONCLUSIONS	Sublingual fentanyl tablets at doses determined by titration were effective and safe for breakthrough pain treatment in cancer patients treated with strong opioid analgesics at fixed intervals .
CONCLUSIONS	Extended treatment up to @ weeks was also effective and safe .

BACKGROUND	Extensive decompression with laminectomy , where appropriate , is often still described as the method of choice when operating on degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis .
BACKGROUND	Nonetheless , tissue-sparing procedures are becoming more common .
BACKGROUND	Endoscopic techniques have become the standard in many areas because of the surgical advantages they offer and the benefits for rehabilitation .
BACKGROUND	One key issue when operating on the spine was the development of instruments to provide sufficient bone resection under continuous visual control .
BACKGROUND	This was achieved by using endoscopes for operations carried out in cases of spinal canal stenosis .
OBJECTIVE	This study of patients with degenerative lumbar central spinal stenosis compares the results of spinal decompression using the full-endoscopic interlaminar technique ( FI ) with a conventional microsurgical laminotomy technique ( MI ) .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized , controlled study .
METHODS	@ patients with microsurgical or full-endoscopic decompression were followed up for @ years .
METHODS	Alongside general and specific parameters , the following measuring instruments were also used for the investigation : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , German version of the North American Spine Society Instrument ( NASS ) , Oswestry Low-Back-Pain-Disability Questionnaire ( ODI ) .
RESULTS	Postoperatively @ % of the patients no longer had leg pain or the pain was almost completely reduced and @ % experienced occasional pain .
RESULTS	The clinical results were the same in both groups .
RESULTS	The rate of complications and revisions was significantly reduced in the FI Group .
RESULTS	The full-endoscopic techniques brought advantages in the following areas : operation , complications , traumatization , rehabilitation .
CONCLUSIONS	Lack of placebo control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The recorded results demonstrate that the full-endoscopic interlaminar bilateral decompression adopting a unilateral approach provides an adequate and safe supplement and alternative to the conventional microsurgical bilateral laminotomy technique when the indication criteria are fulfilled .
CONCLUSIONS	At the same time , it offers the advantages of a minimally invasive intervention .

BACKGROUND	The doctor-patient encounter ( DPE ) and associated patient expectations are potential confounders in open-label randomized trials of treatment efficacy .
BACKGROUND	It is therefore important to evaluate the effects of the DPE on study outcomes .
METHODS	Four hundred participants with chronic low back pain ( LBP ) were randomized to four dose groups : @ , @ , @ , or @ sessions of spinal manipulation from a chiropractor .
METHODS	Participants were treated three times per week for six weeks .
METHODS	They received light massage control at visits when manipulation was not scheduled .
METHODS	Treating chiropractors were instructed to have equal enthusiasm for both interventions .
METHODS	A path analysis was conducted to determine the effects of dose , patient expectations of treatment success , and DPE on LBP intensity ( @-point scale ) at the end of care ( @ weeks ) and primary endpoint ( @ weeks ) .
METHODS	Direct , indirect , and total standardized effects ( total ) were computed .
METHODS	Expectations and DPE were evaluated on Likert scales .
METHODS	The DPE was assessed as patient-rated perception of chiropractor enthusiasm , confidence , comfort with care , and time spent .
RESULTS	The DPE was successfully balanced across groups , as were baseline expectations .
RESULTS	The principal finding was that the magnitude of the effects of DPE on LBP at @ and @ weeks ( | | total = @ and @ , p < @ ) were comparable to the effects of dose of manipulation at those times ( | | total = @ and @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , baseline expectations had no notable effect on follow-up LBP .
RESULTS	Subsequent expectations were affected by LBP , DPE , and dose ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The DPE can have a relatively important effect on outcomes in open-label randomized trials of treatment efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , attempts should be made to balance the DPE across treatment groups and report degree of success in study publications .
CONCLUSIONS	We balanced the DPE across groups with minimal training of treatment providers .

OBJECTIVE	To identify risk factors for failure of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients in the ICU .
METHODS	Multivariable regression analysis of thrombosis predictors from a randomized thromboprophylaxis trial .
METHODS	Sixty-seven medical-surgical ICUs in six countries .
METHODS	Three thousand seven hundred forty-six medical-surgical critically ill patients .
METHODS	All patients received anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at standard doses .
RESULTS	Independent predictors for venous thromboembolism , proximal leg deep vein thrombosis , and pulmonary embolism developing during critical illness were assessed .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) developed venous thromboembolism .
RESULTS	Predictors of thromboprophylaxis failure as measured by development of venous thromboembolism included a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) and body mass index ( hazard ratio , @ per @-point increase ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Increasing body mass index was also a predictor for developing proximal leg deep vein thrombosis ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) , which occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Pulmonary embolism occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) and was associated with body mass index ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) and vasopressor use ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Low-molecular-weight heparin ( in comparison to unfractionated heparin ) thromboprophylaxis lowered pulmonary embolism risk ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) while statin use in the preceding week lowered the risk of proximal leg deep vein thrombosis ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Failure of standard thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is more likely in ICU patients with elevated body mass index , those with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism , and those receiving vasopressors .
CONCLUSIONS	Alternate management or incremental risk reduction strategies may be needed in such patients .

###25332150
BACKGROUND	We conducted this pilot randomized clinical trial to determine the feasibility of a large clinical trial aimed at testing whether early use of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) is superior to antiarrhythmic medications at reducing mortality .
RESULTS	Patients were enrolled at @ sites if they had ischemic heart disease , an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) , and received @ ICD shock or @ antitachycardia pacing therapies for VT. .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized to @ arms : ( @ ) antiarrhythmic medication ( n = @ ) and ( @ ) catheter ablation ( n = @ ) ; patients were followed at @ and @ months .
RESULTS	Endpoints included recurrent VT , time to first ICD therapy for VT , and death .
RESULTS	Of @ screened patients , @ were enrolled .
RESULTS	Main reasons for screen failures were : ( @ ) patient was already on an antiarrhythmic medication ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , ( @ ) VT due to a reversible cause ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and ( @ ) incessant VT ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Fourteen patients had recurrent VT , @ ( @ % ) in the ablation arm and @ ( @ % ) in the antiarrhythmic medication arm .
RESULTS	Median time to recurrent VT was @ days ( @th , @th : @ , @ ) in the ablation arm and @ days ( @ , @ ) in the antiarrhythmic arm .
RESULTS	Four patients died , @ in each arm .
CONCLUSIONS	This clinical trial shows that most patients in clinical practice have already failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy before catheter ablation is considered , and the VT recurrence rates and death in these patients are high .
CONCLUSIONS	For a large clinical trial to be feasible , factors limiting early consideration of catheter ablation need to be identified and addressed .

BACKGROUND	Anxiety , Depression and Somatoform ( ADSom ) disorders are highly prevalent in primary care .
BACKGROUND	Managing these disorders is time-consuming and requires strong commitment on behalf of the General Practitioners ( GPs ) .
BACKGROUND	Furthermore , the management of these patients is restricted by the high patient turnover rates in primary care practices , especially in the German health care system.In order to address this problem , we implement a complex , low-threshold intervention by an Advanced Practice Nurse ( APN ) using a mixture of case management and counseling techniques to promote self-management in these patients .
BACKGROUND	Here we present the protocol of the `` Self-Management Support for Anxiety , Depression and Somatoform Disorders in Primary Care '' ( SMADS ) - Study .
METHODS	The study is designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial , comparing an intervention and a control group of @ primary care practices in each case .
METHODS	We will compare the effectiveness of the intervention applied by an APN with usual GP-care .
METHODS	A total of @ participants will be enrolled in the study , @ in either arm .
METHODS	We use the Patient Health Questionnaire-German version ( PHQ-D ) as a screening tool for psychiatric symptoms , including patients with a score above @ on any of the three symptom scales .
METHODS	The primary outcome is self-efficacy , measured by the General Self-Efficacy Scale ( GSE ) , here used as a proxy for self-management .
METHODS	As secondary outcomes we include the PHQ-D symptom load and questionnaires regarding coping with illness and health related quality of life .
METHODS	Outcome assessments will be applied @ weeks and @ months after the baseline assessment .
CONCLUSIONS	The SMADS-study evaluates a complex , low threshold intervention for ambulatory patients presenting ADSom-symptoms , empowering them to better manage their condition , as well as improving their motivation to engage in self-help and health-seeking behaviour .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefit of the intervention will be substantiated , when patients can enhance their expected self-efficacy , reduce their symptom load and engage in more self-help activities to deal with their everyday lives .
CONCLUSIONS	After successfully evaluating this psychosocial intervention , a new health care model for the management of symptoms of anxiety , depression and somatoform disorders for ambulatory patients could emerge , supplementing the work of the GP .

BACKGROUND	To compare the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine/propofol ( DP ) - total i.v. anaesthesia ( TIVA ) vs remifentanil/propofol ( RP ) - TIVA , both with spontaneous breathing , during airway foreign body ( FB ) removal in children .
METHODS	Seventy-seven children undergoing rigid bronchoscopy for FB removal were randomly allocated to receive either RP-TIVA and spontaneous ventilation ( Group RP , n = @ ) or DP-TIVA and spontaneous ventilation ( Group DP , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Heart rate , arterial pressure , pulse oxygen saturation ( Sp ( O@ ) ) , respiratory rate , end-tidal CO@ ( E ' ( CO@ ) ) , and induction time were recorded .
METHODS	Adverse events , the intervention for these events , and postoperative care duration were also assessed .
RESULTS	The mean induction times were comparable between the two groups ( Group RP @ min vs Group DP @ min , P > @ ) .
RESULTS	At the end of the procedure , the mean ( E ' ( CO@ ) ) was higher in Group RP ( Group RP @ kPa vs Group DP @ kPa , P < @ ) , and respiratory rate was lower in Group RP ( Group RP @ vs Group DP @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , the perioperative haemodynamic profile was more stable in Group DP than that in Group RP .
RESULTS	The incidence rate of breath-holding and intervention were comparable between the two groups .
RESULTS	In the post-anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , no hypoxaemia was observed , and emergence time increased in Group DP ( Group DP @ min vs Group RP @ min , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of cough in PACU was higher in Group RP ( Group RP @ % vs Group DP @ % , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with RP-TIVA , DP-TIVA provided more stable respiratory and haemodynamic profiles , but required a longer recovery time .

RESULTS	In aggregate , PPARGC@A variation was strongly associated with baseline triacylglycerol concentrations ( p = @ ( -@ ) ) , BMI ( p = @ ( -@ ) ) and visceral adiposity ( p = @ ( -@ ) ) , as well as with changes in triacylglycerol concentrations ( p = @ ( -@ ) ) and BMI ( p = @ ( -@ ) ) from baseline to @ year .
RESULTS	PPARGC@B variation was only associated with baseline subcutaneous adiposity ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In individual SNP analyses , Gly@Ser ( rs@ , PPARGC@A ) was associated with accumulation of subcutaneous adiposity and worsening insulin resistance at @ year ( both p < @ ) , while rs@ ( PPARGC@A ) modified the effects of metformin on triacylglycerol levels ( p ( interaction ) = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings provide several novel and other confirmatory insights into the role of PPARGC@A variation with respect to diabetes-related metabolic traits .

BACKGROUND	The possible relationship between the circulating concentrations of T@ and GH sensitivity has not been elucidated .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of levothyroxine supplementation on GH sensitivity in prepubertal boys with idiopathic short stature ( ISS ) .
METHODS	We selected @ prepubertal boys with ISS ( mean age @ years ) and free T@ ( Ft@ ) concentrations between the @rd and the @th percentiles ( Ft@ : @-@ @ ng/dl ) .
METHODS	They were randomly divided into two groups : Group A received thyroid supplementation ( @-@g / kg/day ) for @days , and Group B received placebo for the same period .
METHODS	To evaluate GH sensitivity , an IGF-I generation test ( GH : @g/kg/day sc for @days ) was performed in both groups : under basal conditions , and after @days of levothyroxine supplementation ( or placebo ) .
RESULTS	After thyroid supplementation , Group A had higher Ft@ concentrations compared with Group B ( @ vs @ ng/dl , p = @ ) , their growth velocity was significantly higher ( @ vs @ cm/@months ) , and they exhibited a greater increase in IGF-I after GH administration ( Group A : @ % vs Group B @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Supplementation with levothyroxine for @days promotes an increase in growth velocity , and a greater IGF-I response to short-term GH administration in prepubertal boys with ISS and low-normal thyroid hormone concentrations .

BACKGROUND	Although conventional laparoscopic colectomy is a validated technique , laparoscopic natural-orifice specimen extraction ( NOSE ) colectomy might improve outcome .
BACKGROUND	This randomized clinical trial compared analgesia requirements , postoperative pain , anorectal function , inflammatory response and cosmesis in laparoscopic NOSE colectomy and conventional laparoscopic colectomy .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic NOSE colectomy or conventional laparoscopic colectomy for left-sided colonic disease .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was analgesia requirement .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were operative outcome , inflammatory response , anorectal function and cosmesis .
RESULTS	Forty patients were enrolled in the study , @ in each group ( @ with diverticulitis and @ with colorectal cancer in each group ) .
RESULTS	A significant difference was observed in morphine analogue requirements ( @ of @ patients in the NOSE group versus @ of @ in the conventional group ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patient-controlled epidural analgesia was lower in the NOSE group ( mean @ml versus @ml in the conventional group ; P < @ ) , as was paracetamol use ( mean @ versus @g respectively ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Postoperative pain scores were lower in the NOSE group : mean maximum visual analogue score of @ versus @ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	One week after hospital discharge , pain scores remained higher in the conventional group : @ of @ patients in the conventional group reported pain , compared with one of @ in the NOSE group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Inflammatory responses were greater in patients undergoing NOSE colectomy : higher peak C-reactive protein and interleukin @ levels were observed on postoperative day @ ( P < @ ) and day @ ( P = @ ) respectively .
RESULTS	Postoperative anorectal function , complications and hospital stay were similar in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Laparoscopic NOSE colectomy was associated with less pain and lower analgesia requirements than the conventional laparoscopic extraction .

OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to evaluate the dose-effect relationship of statins in patients with ischemic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , since the role of statins in CHF remains unclear .
METHODS	The South koreAn Pitavastatin Heart FaIluRE ( SAPHIRE ) study was designed to randomize patients with ischemic CHF into daily treatments of @ mg pravastatin or @ mg pitavastatin .
RESULTS	The low density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased by @ % in the pitavastatin group compared with @ % in the pravastatin ( p < @ ) group .
RESULTS	Left ventricular systolic dimensions decreased significantly by @ % in the pitavastatin group and by @ % in the pravastatin group .
RESULTS	Left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) improved significantly from @ % to @ % in the pitavastatin group and from @ % to @ % in the pravastatin group .
RESULTS	Although the extent of the EF change was greater in the pitavastatin group ( @ % vs. @ % ) than that in the pravastatin group , no significant difference was observed between the groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Exercise capacity , evaluated by the @-min walking test , improved significantly in the pravastatin group ( p < @ ) , but no change was observed in the pitavastatin group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Very low dose/low potency pravastatin and high dose/high potency pitavastatin had a beneficial effect on cardiac reverse remodeling and improved systolic function in patients with ischemic CHF .
CONCLUSIONS	However , only pravastatin significantly improved exercise capacity .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that lowering cholesterol too much may not be beneficial for patients with CHF .

METHODS	At every visit , participants were randomised in blocks of six and @ , stratified by disease severity .
METHODS	Randomisation was done by research nurses and codes were in sealed , sequentially numbered , opaque envelopes .
METHODS	Independent reviewers masked to treatment allocation compared digital images of sores from days @ and @ .
METHODS	The primary outcome was treatment success at day @ in a modified intention-to-treat analysis .
METHODS	This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN@ .
RESULTS	Between Nov @ , @ , and Nov @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive benzathine benzylpenicillin ( n = @ -LSB- @ analysed -RSB- ) , twice-daily co-trimoxazole for @ days ( n = @ -LSB- @ analysed -RSB- ) , or once-daily co-trimoxazole for @ days ( n = @ -LSB- @ analysed -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Treatment was successful in @ ( @ % ) children who received benzathine benzylpenicillin and @ ( @ % ) who received pooled co-trimoxazole ( absolute difference @ % ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) , showing non-inferiority of co-trimoxazole ( @ % margin ) .
RESULTS	Results for twice-daily co-trimoxazole for @ days and once-daily co-trimoxazole for @ days were similar .
RESULTS	Adverse events occurred in @ participants , @ ( @ % ) of whom received benzathine benzylpenicillin .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-course co-trimoxazole is a non-inferior , alternative treatment to benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo ; it is palatable , pain-free , practical , and easily administered .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the normal variation in central retinal thickness asymmetry in healthy Caucasian adults using the posterior pole asymmetry analysis ( PPAA ) of a SPECTRALIS spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) device .
METHODS	Healthy Caucasian individuals aged between @ and @ years with a visual acuity of minimum @/@ and a spherical equivalent between -@ and +@ diopters were recruited .
METHODS	Retinal thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ( RNFL ) were using measured SPECTRALIS SD-OCT .
METHODS	Inter - and intraocular differences in central retinal thickness were calculated using the PPAA .
METHODS	The association between age , sex , and interocular asymmetry was evaluated by a linear model with Gaussian correlation structure .
RESULTS	A total of @ individuals , @ men and @ women , were studied .
RESULTS	The mean age SD was @ @ years .
RESULTS	The grand mean interocular retinal thickness asymmetry was @ m ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ ) and the grand mean intraocular retinal thickness asymmetry was @ m ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) in the right eye and @ m ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) in the left eye .
RESULTS	The highest local asymmetries were found in the nasal corners of macula were the posterior pole thickness map overlaps the temporal vascular arches .
RESULTS	A slight general age and sex effect on the mean interocular retinal thickness asymmetry was found to be respectively @ m/year ( @ % CI : @-@ @ m ) and @ m ( @ % CI : @-@ @ m ) for men compared with women .
CONCLUSIONS	Statistically significant physiological asymmetries in inter - and intraocular central retinal thickness exist .
CONCLUSIONS	This must be considered when early signs of glaucoma or other pathologies are evaluated based on the retinal thickness asymmetry .
