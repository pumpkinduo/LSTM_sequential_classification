BACKGROUND	IgE sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and a positive sputum fungal culture result are common in patients with refractory asthma .
BACKGROUND	It is not clear whether these patients would benefit from antifungal treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether a @-month course of voriconazole improved asthma-related outcomes in patients with asthma who are IgE sensitized to A fumigatus .
METHODS	Asthmatic patients who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus with a history of at least @ severe exacerbations in the previous @ months were treated for @ months with @ mg of voriconazole twice daily , followed by observation for @ months , in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized design .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were improvement in quality of life at the end of the treatment period and a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations over the @ months of the study .
RESULTS	Sixty-five patients were randomized .
RESULTS	Fifty-nine patients started treatment ( @ receiving voriconazole and @ receiving placebo ) and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis .
RESULTS	Fifty-six patients took the full @ months of medication .
RESULTS	Between the voriconazole and placebo groups , there were no significant differences in the number of severe exacerbations ( @ vs @ per patient per year , respectively ; mean difference , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , quality of life ( change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score , @ vs @ ; mean difference between groups , @ ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) , or any of our secondary outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	We were unable to show a beneficial effect of @ months of treatment with voriconazole in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus on either the rate of severe exacerbations , quality of life , or other markers of asthma control .

BACKGROUND	Opioid antagonists ( e.g. , naltrexone ) and positive modulators of - aminobutyric-acidA ( GABAA ) receptors ( e.g. , alprazolam ) modestly attenuate the abuse-related effects of stimulants like amphetamine .
BACKGROUND	The use of higher doses to achieve greater efficacy is precluded by side effects .
BACKGROUND	Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds .
OBJECTIVE	The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone .
METHODS	Eight nontreatment-seeking , stimulant-using individuals completed an outpatient experiment in which oral d-amphetamine ( @ , @ , and @ mg ) was administered following acute pretreatment with naltrexone ( @ and @ mg ) and alprazolam ( @ and @ mg ) .
METHODS	Subjective effects , psychomotor task performance , and physiological measures were collected .
RESULTS	Oral d-amphetamine produced prototypical physiological and stimulant-like positive subjective effects ( e.g. , VAS ratings of Active/Alert/Energetic , Good Effect , and High ) .
RESULTS	Pretreatment with naltrexone , alprazolam , and their combination did not produce clinically problematic acute physiological effects or negative subjective effects .
RESULTS	Naltrexone and alprazolam each significantly attenuated some of the subjective effects of d-amphetamine .
RESULTS	The combination attenuated a greater number of subjective effects than the constituent drugs alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The present results support the continued evaluation of an opioid receptor antagonist combined with a GABAA-positive modulator using more clinically relevant experimental conditions like examining the effect of chronic dosing with these drugs on methamphetamine self-administration .

BACKGROUND	The sequencing of learning materials greatly influences the knowledge that learners construct .
BACKGROUND	Recently , learning theorists have focused on the sequencing of instruction in relation to solving related problems .
BACKGROUND	The general consensus suggests explicit instruction should be provided ; however , when to provide instruction remains unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the impact of conceptual instruction preceding or following mathematics problem solving to determine when conceptual instruction should or should not be delayed .
OBJECTIVE	We also examined the learning processes supported to inform theories of learning more broadly .
METHODS	We worked with @ second - and third-grade children .
METHODS	In a randomized experiment , children received instruction on the concept of math equivalence either before or after being asked to solve and explain challenging equivalence problems with feedback .
RESULTS	Providing conceptual instruction first resulted in greater procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge of equation structures than delaying instruction until after problem solving .
RESULTS	Prior conceptual instruction enhanced problem solving by increasing the quality of explanations and attempted procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing conceptual instruction prior to problem solving was the more effective sequencing of activities than the reverse .
CONCLUSIONS	We compare these results with previous , contrasting findings to outline a potential framework for understanding when instruction should or should not be delayed .

BACKGROUND	Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care .
BACKGROUND	`` No-show '' appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use .
BACKGROUND	Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence , particularly in disadvantaged populations , but may not be cost-effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients .
METHODS	In @ clinics within a large academic cancer center , patients who were considered to be likely ( the top @th percentile ) to miss a scheduled appointment without contacting the clinic ahead of time ( `` no-shows '' ) were identified using a predictive model and then randomized to an intervention versus a usual-care group .
METHODS	The intervention group received telephone calls from a bilingual patient navigator @ days before and @ day before the appointment .
RESULTS	Over a @-month period , of the @,@ appointments scheduled , @ patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a `` no-show '' event .
RESULTS	After the patient navigation intervention , the no-show rate in the intervention group was @ % ( @ of @ ) , compared with @ % in the control group ( @ of @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no-show rate ( @ % and @ % , respectively ; P < @ and @ , respectively ) compared with leaving a message ( @ % : P = @ ) or no contact ( no-show rate , @ % : P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to determine the long-term impact on patient outcomes , but short-term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately .

BACKGROUND	Insufficient skills in drug dose calculations increase the risk for medication errors .
BACKGROUND	Even experienced nurses may struggle with such calculations .
BACKGROUND	Learning flexibility and cost considerations make e-learning interesting as an alternative to classroom teaching .
BACKGROUND	This study compared the learning outcome and risk of error after a course in drug dose calculations for nurses with the two methods .
METHODS	In a randomised controlled open study , nurses from hospitals and primary healthcare were randomised to either e-learning or classroom teaching .
METHODS	Before and after a @-day course , the nurses underwent a multiple choice test in drug dose calculations : @ tasks with four alternative answers ( score @-@ ) , and a statement regarding the certainty of each answer ( score @-@ ) .
METHODS	High risk of error was being certain that incorrect answer was correct .
METHODS	The results are given as the mean ( SD ) .
RESULTS	@ men and @ women participated in the study , aged @ ( @ ) years with a working experience of @ ( @ ) years .
RESULTS	The number of correct answers after e-learning was @ ( @ ) and after classroom teaching @ ( @ ) ( p = @ , NS ) ; improvement were @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) , respectively ( p = @ , NS ) .
RESULTS	Classroom learning was significantly superior to e-learning among participants with a pretest score below @ .
RESULTS	In support of e-learning was evaluation of specific value for the working situation .
RESULTS	There was no difference in risk of error between groups after the course ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The study showed no differences in learning outcome or risk of error between e-learning and classroom teaching in drug dose calculations .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall learning outcome was small .
CONCLUSIONS	Weak precourse knowledge was associated with better outcome after classroom teaching .

BACKGROUND	Previous investigation showed that the volume-time curve technique could be an alternative for endotracheal tube ( ETT ) cuff management .
BACKGROUND	However , the clinical impact of the volume-time curve application has not been documented .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence and intensity of a sore throat , cough , thoracic pain , and pulmonary function between these @ techniques for ETT cuff management : volume-time curve technique versus minimal occlusive volume ( MOV ) technique after coronary artery bypass grafting .
METHODS	A total of @ subjects were randomized into @ groups for cuff management after intubation : MOV group ( n = @ ) and volume-time curve group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	We measured cuff pressure before extubation .
METHODS	We performed spirometry @ h before and after surgery .
METHODS	We graded sore throat and cough according to a @-point scale at @ , @ , @ , and @ h after extubation and assessed thoracic pain at @ h after extubation and quantified the level of pain by a @-point scale .
RESULTS	The volume-time curve group presented significantly lower cuff pressure ( @ @ vs @ @ cm H@O ) , less incidence and intensity of sore throat ( @ h , @ vs @ % ; and @ h , @ vs @ % , P < @ ) , cough ( @ h , @ vs @ % ; and @ h , @ vs @ % , P < @ ) , thoracic pain ( @ @ vs @ @ ) , better preservation of FVC ( @ @ vs @ @ % , P = @ ) , and FEV@ ( @ @ vs @ @ % , P = @ ) compared with the MOV group .
CONCLUSIONS	The subjects who received the volume-time curve technique for ETT cuff management presented a significantly lower incidence and severity of sore throat and cough , less thoracic pain , and minimally impaired pulmonary function than those subjects who received the MOV technique during the first @ h after coronary artery bypass grafting .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate age at attaining Tanner stages in Ugandan/Zimbabwean HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in older childhood and investigate predictors of delayed puberty , particularly age at ART initiation .
METHODS	Observational analysis within a randomized trial .
METHODS	Tanner staging was assessed every @ weeks from @ years of age , menarche every @ weeks and height every @-@ weeks .
METHODS	Age at attaining different Tanner stages was estimated using normal interval regression , considering predictors using multivariable regression .
METHODS	Growth was estimated using multilevel models with child-specific intercepts and trajectories .
RESULTS	Median age at ART initiation was @ years ( inter-quartile range @ , @ ) ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	At the first assessment , the majority ( @ % ) were in Tanner stage @ ; median follow-up with staging was @ years .
RESULTS	There was a strong delaying effect of older age at ART initiation on age at attaining all Tanner stages ( P < @ ) and menarche ( P = @ ) ; in boys the delaying effect generally weakened with older age .
RESULTS	There were additional significant delays associated with greater impairments in pre-ART height-for-age Z-score ( P < @ ) in both sexes and pre-ART BMI-for-age in girls ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no evidence that pre-ART immuno-suppression independently delayed puberty or menarche .
RESULTS	However , older children/adolescents had significant growth spurts in intermediate Tanner stages , and were still significantly increasing their height when in Tanner stage @ ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Delaying ART initiation until older childhood substantially delays pubertal development and menarche , independently of immuno-suppression .
CONCLUSIONS	This highlights that factors other than CD@ , such as pubertal development , need consideration when making decisions about timing of ART initiation in older children .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of a patient oriented decision aid for prioritising treatment goals in diabetes compared with usual care on patient empowerment and treatment decisions .
METHODS	Pragmatic randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	@ general practices in the north of the Netherlands .
METHODS	@ patients with type @ diabetes aged @ years at the time of diagnosis and managed in primary care between April @ and August @ : @ were allocated to the intervention group and @ to the usual care group .
METHODS	The intervention comprised a decision aid for people with diabetes , with individually tailored risk information and treatment options for multiple risk factors .
METHODS	The aid was intended to empower patients to prioritise between clinical domains and to support treatment decisions .
METHODS	It was offered to participants before a regular diabetes check-up and to their healthcare provider during the consultation .
METHODS	Four different formats of the decision aid were included for additional explorative analyses .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the effects on patient empowerment for setting and achieving goals .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes were changes in the prescribing of drugs to regulate glucose , blood pressure , lipids , and albuminuria .
METHODS	Data were collected through structured questionnaires and automated data extraction from electronic health records during six months before and after the intervention .
RESULTS	Of all intervention participants , @ ( @ % ) reported to have received the basic elements of the intervention .
RESULTS	For the primary outcome analysis , @ intervention and @ control patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data could be included .
RESULTS	The mean empowerment score increased @ on a @ point scale in the overall intervention group , which was not significantly different from that of the control group ( mean difference after adjusting for baseline @ , @ % confidence interval -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Lipid regulating drug treatment was intensified in @ % of intervention and @ % of control participants with increased cholesterol levels , which did not reach significance when the intervention was compared with the usual care group ( odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Prespecified explorative analyses showed that this effect was significant for the printed version of the decision aid in comparison to usual care ( @ , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	No relevant or significant changes were seen for other treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no evidence that the patient oriented treatment decision aid improves patient empowerment by an important amount .
CONCLUSIONS	The aid was not used to its full extent in a substantial number of participants .

BACKGROUND	Bicalutamide blocks androgen action and is frequently used in men with non-metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) .
BACKGROUND	By reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone , dutasteride ( dual @-alpha reductase inhibitor ) could increase the effectiveness of bicalutamide in this setting .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the study is therefore to prospectively evaluate dutasteride plus bicalutamide in men with asymptomatic , non-metastatic CRPC with rising prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) .
METHODS	Prostate cancer patients with rising PSA whilst on first-line androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) were randomised ( @:@ ) in a double-blind trial to receive bicalutamide @mg plus placebo or bicalutamide @mg plus dutasteride @ mg once daily for @ months .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by centre ; treatment assignments were generated using GlaxoSmithKline 's RandAll System .
METHODS	Subjects who completed @ months could participate in the @-year extension .
METHODS	Central laboratory and study sites/monitors remained treatment-blinded .
METHODS	Primary end-point was time to disease progression ( TDP ) up to @ months ( defined as PSA progression from baseline or nadir , radiographic disease progression , death from prostate cancer or receipt of rescue medication ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in @ men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride ( n = @ ) compared with bicalutamide/placebo ( n = @ ) ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @ , @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The estimated median TDP was @ days ( @ % CI @ , @ ) in the bicalutamide/placebo group and @ days ( @ % CI @ , @ ) in the bicalutamide/dutasteride group .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for any secondary efficacy end-points , including time to treatment failure or PSA response .
RESULTS	In the multivariate analysis , age , non-White race , higher baseline testosterone and lower baseline PSA were associated with longer TDP .
RESULTS	Adverse events were comparable between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In men with non-metastatic CRPC , adding dutasteride to bicalutamide did not significantly prolong TDP .
CONCLUSIONS	Prospective data are provided concerning the common practice of using bicalutamide in this setting .

BACKGROUND	Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops , and is a part of every woman 's life .
BACKGROUND	It usually occurs between the ages of @ and @ years , and is associated with hormonal , physical , and psychological changes .
BACKGROUND	Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause .
BACKGROUND	In this stage , the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone .
BACKGROUND	When the body produces less of these hormones , the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women .
METHODS	A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block , Kanchipuram District , Tamil Nadu , India .
METHODS	A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study .
METHODS	Of @ menopausal women identified , @ were allocated to a study group and @ to a control group .
METHODS	The study group underwent yoga training for @ hours per day on @ consecutive days .
METHODS	After the @-day intensive yoga training program , the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for @-@ minutes a day .
METHODS	Along with daily yoga practice , they underwent group yoga practice for @ days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until @ weeks .
METHODS	The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas , Pranayama ( breathing exercises ) , and meditation .
METHODS	The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women 's quality of life .
METHODS	We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women 's self-reference at home after the @ days of continuous yoga practice .
METHODS	A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga .
METHODS	The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program ; however , on completion of the study , these women received intensive yoga training for @ days .
RESULTS	There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life after @ , @ , and @ weeks of yoga therapy .
RESULTS	The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks @ , @ , and @ .
RESULTS	The overall mean gain score in the study group was @ versus @ in the control group .
RESULTS	The overall mean gain score difference was @ in all domains of quality of life between the study group and the control group .
RESULTS	In the study group , the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life were greatly improved by practicing yoga for @ weeks .
RESULTS	No adverse events were reported by the women after yoga practice .
CONCLUSIONS	Quality of life in menopausal women was greatly improved after @ weeks of yoga practice .

BACKGROUND	Tubal ectopic pregnancy can be surgically treated by salpingectomy , in which the affected Fallopian tube is removed , or salpingotomy , in which the tube is preserved .
BACKGROUND	Despite potentially increased risks of persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy , salpingotomy is often preferred over salpingectomy because the preservation of both tubes is assumed to offer favourable fertility prospects , although little evidence exists to support this assumption .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether salpingotomy would improve rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy .
METHODS	In this open-label , multicentre , international , randomised controlled trial , women aged @ years and older with a laparoscopically confirmed tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube were randomly assigned via a central internet-based randomisation program to receive salpingotomy or salpingectomy .
METHODS	The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy by natural conception .
METHODS	Differences in cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates were expressed as a fecundity rate ratio with @ % CI , calculated by Cox proportional-hazards analysis with a time horizon of @ months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy ( expressed as relative risks -LSB- RRs -RSB- with @ % CIs ) and ongoing pregnancy after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF .
METHODS	The researchers who collected data for fertility outcomes were masked to the assigned intervention , but patients and the investigators who analysed the data were not .
METHODS	All endpoints were analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	We also did a ( non-prespecified ) meta-analysis that included the findings from the present trial .
METHODS	This trial is registered , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	@ women were randomly assigned between Sept @ , @ , and Nov @ , @ , with @ allocated to salpingotomy and @ to salpingectomy .
RESULTS	Follow-up was discontinued on Feb @ , @ .
RESULTS	The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was @ % after salpingotomy and @ % after salpingectomy ( fecundity rate ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; log-rank p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Persistent trophoblast occurred more frequently in the salpingotomy group than in the salpingectomy group ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- < @ % -RSB- ; RR @ , @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurred in @ women ( @ % ) in the salpingotomy group and @ ( @ % ) women in the salpingectomy group ( RR @ , @-@ ) .
RESULTS	The number of ongoing pregnancies after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF did not differ significantly between the groups .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) women in the salpingotomy group were converted to salpingectomy during the initial surgery because of persistent tubal bleeding .
RESULTS	Our meta-analysis , which included our own results and those of one other study , substantiated the results of the trial .
CONCLUSIONS	In women with a tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube , salpingotomy does not significantly improve fertility prospects compared with salpingectomy .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury and troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial infarction .
METHODS	@ patients randomised to the point-of-care testing arm of the Randomised Assessment of Panel Assay of Cardiac markers ( RATPAC ) study in six emergency departments of low-risk patients presenting with chest pain were studied .
METHODS	Blood samples were obtained on admission and @ min from admission .
METHODS	Myocardial infarction was defined by the universal definition of myocardial infarction .
METHODS	The following diagnostic strategies were compared by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and comparison of area under the curve : individual marker values and the combination of presentation heart fatty acid binding protein ( HFABP ) and copeptin with troponin .
RESULTS	@ patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction .
RESULTS	Admission samples were available from @/@ patients enrolled in the study .
RESULTS	Areas under the curve were as follows ( CIs in parentheses ) : cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) Stratus CS @ ( @ to @ ) , cTnI Beckmann @ ( @ to @ ) , cTnI Siemens ultra @ ( @ to @ ) , cardiac troponin T high sensitivity @ ( @ to @ ) , HFABP @ @ ( @ to @ ) copeptin @ ( @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	HFABP and copeptin were diagnostically inferior to troponin .
RESULTS	The combination of HFABP ( at the @th percentile ) and troponin ( at the @th percentile ) increased diagnostic sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the best single marker .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of HFABP to high-sensitivity troponin increased diagnostic sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional measurement of copeptin is not useful in the chest pain population .

BACKGROUND	Multidimensional tinnitus models describe dysfunctional cognitions as a complicating factor in the process of tinnitus habituation .
BACKGROUND	However , this concept has rarely been investigated in previous research .
OBJECTIVE	The present study investigated the effects of two cognitive-behavioral treatments on dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions in patients with chronic tinnitus .
OBJECTIVE	Furthermore , dysfunctional cognitions were examined as possible predictors of the therapeutic effect on tinnitus distress .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with chronic tinnitus were randomly assigned to either an Internet-delivered guided self-help treatment ( Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy , ICBT ) , a conventional face-to-face group therapy ( cognitive-behavioral group therapy , GCBT ) , or an active control group in the form of a web-based discussion forum ( DF ) .
METHODS	To assess tinnitus-related dysfunctional thoughts , the Tinnitus Cognitions Scale ( T-Cog ) was used at pre - and post-assessment , as well as at the @ - and @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Multivariate ANOVAs with post hoc tests revealed significant and comparable reductions of dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions for both treatments ( GCBT and ICBT ) , which remained stable over a @ - and @-month period .
RESULTS	Negative correlations were found between the catastrophic subscale of the T-Cog and therapy outcome for ICBT , but not for GCBT .
RESULTS	This means a higher degree of catastrophic thinking at baseline was associated with lower benefit from ICBT directly after the treatment .
RESULTS	Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed catastrophizing as a predictor of poorer therapy outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT .
RESULTS	No associations were detected in the follow-up assessments .
CONCLUSIONS	Both forms of CBT are successful in reducing dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions .
CONCLUSIONS	Catastrophizing significantly predicted a less favorable outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical implications of these results are described .
CONCLUSIONS	Dysfunctional cognitions could be targeted more intensively in therapy and in future research on tinnitus .

OBJECTIVE	Handling emergency telephone consultations ( ETCs ) is a challenging and very important task for doctors .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of the study were to document insecurity in medical students during ETCs and to identify the reasons for that insecurity .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that insecurity is associated with advising more urgent action ( e.g. advice to call for an ambulance ) in ETCs .
METHODS	We used ETCs with simulated patients ( SPs ) , with each student randomly allocated two of four possible cases .
METHODS	After the training , @ students reported on any insecurity that they had in the various ETC phases .
METHODS	We analysed the reasons for insecurity using descriptive statistics .
METHODS	The association between the students ' advice that urgent action was needed and their insecurity was analysed with Spearman rank correlation .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % of the students felt insecure in at least one phase of their ETC. .
RESULTS	History taking was the phase in which students felt most insecure ( @ % ) , followed by the phase of analysing the information given by the patient ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Perceived insecurity was associated with more urgent advice in one case scenario ( abdominal pain ; correlation r = @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The other two cases ( child with fever ; chest pain ) also had a positive , but not statistically significant , correlation trend ( p < @ ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Insecurity is highly prevalent among medical students in their ETC decision-making .
CONCLUSIONS	ETC training in medical schools , with a focus on structured history taking and formulating discriminating questions , might help decrease insecurity in ETCs .
CONCLUSIONS	Medical education should also teach management of insecurity .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the efficacy of intravenous ( IV ) preemptive paracetamol on postoperative total fentanyl consumption and fentanyl-related side effects in patients undergoing open nephrectomy .
METHODS	A total of @ patients scheduled for elective open nephrectomy under general anesthesia were included .
METHODS	All patients received Patient-controlled IV analgesia with fentanyl postoperatively .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated into three equal groups : The fentanyl group received @ mL of IV normal saline as a placebo , with the first dose ending @ min before intubation .
METHODS	In paracetamol group , IV @ g paracetamol was given to the patients @ min after extubation with repeated doses every @ h totally @ times a day .
METHODS	In preemptive paracetamol group , patients received IV @ g paracetamol every @ h , with the first dose ending @ min before intubation .
RESULTS	Postoperative cumulative fentanyl consumption for @ h was significantly higher in the fentanyl group ( @ @ g ) than those of paracetamol ( @ @ g ) and preemptive paracetamol groups ( @ @ g ) ( P = @ for both ) .
RESULTS	In early postoperative period ( @-@ h ) ; whereas total fentanyl consumption showed no statistically significant difference among groups ( P = @ ) , the nausea-vomiting scores were significantly higher in the fentanyl group compared with other groups ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients undergoing open nephrectomy , use of preemptive or postoperative paracetamol reduces fentanyl related nausea-vomiting without a decrease in total fentanyl consumption in the early postoperative period .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , use of preemptive or postoperative paracetamol reduces total fentanyl requirements in the first @ h postoperatively providing a safe and effective postoperative analgesia .

BACKGROUND	Brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) are frequently found after carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) , but their clinical relevance remains unclear .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to investigate whether periprocedural ischemic DWI lesions after CAS or carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) are associated with an increased risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events .
METHODS	In the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) substudy of ICSS ( International Carotid Stenting Study ) , @ patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to undergo CAS ( n = @ ) or CEA ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	MRIs were performed @ to @ days before and @ to @ days after treatment .
METHODS	The primary outcome event was stroke or transient ischemic attack in any territory occurring between the post-treatment MRI and the end of follow-up .
METHODS	Time to occurrence of the primary outcome event was compared between patients with ( DWI + ) and without ( DWI - ) new DWI lesions on the post-treatment scan in the CAS and CEA groups separately .
RESULTS	Median time of follow-up was @ years ( interquartile range : @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	In the CAS group , recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred more often among DWI + patients ( @ of @ ) than among DWI - patients ( @ of @ ) , with a cumulative @-year incidence of @ % ( standard error -LSB- SE -RSB- : @ % ) and @ % ( SE : @ % ) , respectively ( unadjusted hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In DWI + and DWI - patients , @ and @ events , respectively , occurred within @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	In the CEA group , there was no difference in recurrent cerebrovascular events between DWI + and DWI - patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Ischemic brain lesions discovered on DWI after CAS seem to be a marker of increased risk for recurrent cerebrovascular events .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with periprocedural DWI lesions might benefit from more aggressive and prolonged antiplatelet therapy after CAS .
CONCLUSIONS	( A Randomised Comparison of the Risks , Benefits and Cost Effectiveness of Primary Carotid Stenting With Carotid Endarterectomy : International Carotid Stenting Study ; ISRCTN@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Misoprostol is established for the treatment of incomplete abortion but has not been systematically assessed when provided by midwives at district level in a low-resource setting .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the effectiveness and safety of midwives diagnosing and treating incomplete abortion with misoprostol , compared with physicians .
METHODS	We did a multicentre randomised controlled equivalence trial at district level at six facilities in Uganda .
METHODS	Eligibility criteria were women with signs of incomplete abortion .
METHODS	We randomly allocated women with first-trimester incomplete abortion to clinical assessment and treatment with misoprostol either by a physician or a midwife .
METHODS	The randomisation ( @:@ ) was done in blocks of @ and was stratified for study site .
METHODS	Primary outcome was complete abortion not needing surgical intervention within @-@ days after initial treatment .
METHODS	The study was not masked .
METHODS	Analysis of the primary outcome was done on the per-protocol population with a generalised linear-mixed effects model .
METHODS	The predefined equivalence range was -@ % to @ % .
METHODS	The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	From April @ , @ , to July @ , @ , @ women were assessed for eligibility .
RESULTS	@ women were randomly assigned to each group ( @ to midwife group and @ to physician group ) .
RESULTS	@ women ( @ in the midwife group and @ in the physician group ) were included in the per-protocol analysis .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) of women in the midwife group had complete abortion and @ ( @ % ) in the physician group .
RESULTS	The model-based risk difference for midwife versus physician group was -@ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) , falling within the predefined equivalence range ( -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	The overall proportion of women with incomplete abortion was @ % ( @/@ ) , similarly distributed between the two groups ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- in the midwife group , @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- in the physician group ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were recorded .
CONCLUSIONS	Diagnosis and treatment of incomplete abortion with misoprostol by midwives is equally safe and effective as when provided by physicians , in a low-resource setting .
CONCLUSIONS	Scaling up midwives ' involvement in treatment of incomplete abortion with misoprostol at district level would increase access to safe post-abortion care .

BACKGROUND	Much of the existing literature on physical activity ( PA ) interventions involves physically inactive individuals recruited from community settings rather than clinical practice settings .
BACKGROUND	Recruitment of patients into interventions in clinical practice settings is difficult due to limited time available in the clinic , identification of appropriate personnel to efficiently conduct the process , and time-consuming methods of recruitment .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this report is to describe the approach used to identify and recruit veterans from the Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Pittsburgh Healthcare System Primary Care Clinic into a randomized controlled PA study .
METHODS	A sampling frame of veterans was developed using the VA electronic medical record .
METHODS	During regularly scheduled clinic appointments , primary care providers ( PCPs ) screened identified patients for safety to engage in moderate-intensity PA and willingness to discuss the study with research staff members .
METHODS	Research staff determined eligibility with a subsequent telephone screening call and scheduled a research study appointment , at which time signed informed consent and baseline measurements were obtained .
RESULTS	Of the @,@ veterans in the sampling frame who were scheduled for a primary care appointment during the study period , @,@ ( @ % ) were seen in the clinic and screened by the PCP ; moderate-intensity PA was deemed safe for @,@ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) agreed to be contacted for further screening , @ ( @ % ) were eligible for the study , and @ ( @ % ) enrolled .
CONCLUSIONS	Using a semiautomated screening approach that combined an electronically-derived sampling frame with paper and pencil prescreening by PCPs and research staff , VA-STRIDE was able to recruit @ in @ veterans in the sampling frame .
CONCLUSIONS	Using this approach , a high proportion of potentially eligible veterans were screened by their PCPs .

OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that clevidipine , a rapidly acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , is not inferior to nitroglycerin ( NTG ) in controlling blood pressure before cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) during coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .
METHODS	In this double-blind study from October @ , @ to April @ , @ , @ patients undergoing CABG with CPB were randomized at four centres to receive intravenous infusions of clevidipine ( @-@gkg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) or NTG ( @ gkg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) to a clinician-determined maximum dose rate ) from induction of anesthesia through @hr postoperatively .
METHODS	The study drug was titrated in the pre-CPB period with the aim of maintaining mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) within @mmHg of a clinician-predetermined target .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the area under the curve ( AUC ) for the total time each patient 's MAP was outside the target range from drug initiation to the start of CPB , normalized per hour ( AUCMAP-D ) .
METHODS	The predefined non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint was a @ % confidence interval ( CI ) upper limit no greater than @ for the geometric means ratio between clevidipine and NTG .
RESULTS	Total mean -LSB- standard deviation ( SD ) -RSB- dose pre-bypass was @ ( @ ) mg for clevidipine and @ ( @ ) mg for NTG ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The geometric mean AUCMAP-D for clevidipine was @mmHgminhr ( -@ ) ( n = @ ) and for NTG was @mmHgminhr ( -@ ) ( n = @ ) ; the geometric means ratio was @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The geometric mean AUCMAP-D during aortic cannulation was @ mmHgminhr ( -@ ) for clevidipine compared with @ mmHgminhr ( -@ ) for NTG .
RESULTS	Mean ( SD ) heart rate with clevidipine was @ ( @ ) beatsmin ( -@ ) compared with @ ( @ ) beatsmin ( -@ ) for NTG .
RESULTS	There were no clinically important differences between groups in adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	During CABG , clevidipine was not inferior to NTG for blood pressure control pre-bypass .

BACKGROUND	Postnatal common mental disorders among women are an important public health problem internationally .
BACKGROUND	Interventions to prevent postnatal depression have had limited success .
BACKGROUND	What Were We Thinking ( WWWT ) is a structured , gender-informed , psychoeducational group programme for parents and their first infant that addresses two modifiable risks to postnatal mental health .
BACKGROUND	This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WWWT when implemented in usual primary care .
METHODS	@ maternal and child health ( MCH ) centres from six diverse Local Government Areas , in Victoria , Australia are randomly allocated to the intervention group ( usual care plus WWWT ) or the control group ( usual care ) .
METHODS	The required sample size is @ women in each group .
METHODS	English-speaking primiparous women receiving postpartum healthcare in participating MCH centres complete two computer-assisted telephone interviews : baseline at @weeks and outcome at @months postpartum .
METHODS	Women attending intervention MCH centres are invited to attend WWWT in addition to usual care .
METHODS	The primary outcome is meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) diagnostic criteria for major depressive episode ; generalised anxiety disorder ; panic disorder with or without agoraphobia , agoraphobia with or without panic , social phobia , adult separation anxiety or adjustment disorder with depressed mood , anxiety or mixed depressed mood and anxiety within the past @days at @months postpartum .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes are self-rated general and emotional health , infant sleep problems , method of infant feeding , quality of mother-infant relationship and intimate partner relationship , and healthcare costs and outcomes .

BACKGROUND	To evaluate the efficacy of the surgical fat-filling procedure ( SFFP ) in the treatment of refractory cough and quality of life ( QOL ) after systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy in patients with right lung cancer .
METHODS	This is a blinded , randomized , controlled clinical trial to evaluate refractory cough and QOL in patients after mediastinal lymphadenectomy for lung cancer .
METHODS	One hundred eligible lung cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups : the fat-filling group and non-filling group .
METHODS	In the fat-filling group , post-lymphadenectomy residual cavities ( PLRCs ) were filled with fatty tissue autografts after lymph node dissection .
METHODS	In the non-filling group , the PLRCs remained unfilled .
METHODS	Clinical endpoints were postoperative cough score and QOL .
RESULTS	The SFFP did not increase intraoperative bleeding , extend operation time , or hospital stay .
RESULTS	Further , night cough was significantly improved after @wk in the fat-filling group after the removal of a chest drainage tube .
RESULTS	QOL issues , such as emotional condition , functional status , and additional concerns , demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the fat-filling group at postoperative @mo compared with the non-filling ( control ) group .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates that filling PLRCs with fatty tissue autografts is a safe and partially effective treatment for refractory cough after major pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	This novel procedure significantly improved patient QOL and may prove useful as a relatively safe preventive surgical adjunct operation for refractory cough .

OBJECTIVE	Modafinil has been reported to benefit a subgroup of patients suffering severe fatigue while undergoing chemotherapy .
OBJECTIVE	Docetaxel is associated with fatigue that may lead to premature therapy withdrawal .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether modafinil could reduce fatigue during docetaxel chemotherapy .
METHODS	This multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of modafinil in patients with metastatic prostate or breast cancer undergoing docetaxel chemotherapy ( every @ days ; minimum dose @ mg/m ( @ ) ) .
METHODS	At the start of their third or subsequent chemotherapy cycle , patients with significant docetaxel-associated fatigue were randomized to receive concurrent modafinil @ mg/day or placebo for @ days ( `` treatment periods '' ( TP ) ) .
METHODS	Docetaxel was continued for up to four further cycles .
METHODS	Fatigue was evaluated with the fatigue component of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was cumulative MDASI area under the curve ( AUC ) during the first @ days of study medication during TP@ and TP@ .
RESULTS	Evaluable data were available from @ patients ( @ with prostate cancer ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms for the primary endpoint ( MSADI AUC@-@ @ vs @ ; @ % confidence interval -@ , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall toxicity was comparable between treatment groups ; however , the incidence of grade @ nausea and vomiting was higher in the modafinil arm ( @ vs @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Assessing and managing chemotherapy-related fatigue remains a major challenge .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a lack of difference between the two arms in the planned primary endpoint .
CONCLUSIONS	However , there was a modest but consistent trend towards improvement of docetaxel-related fatigue in those treated with modafinil .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the study findings , modafinil for the treatment of fatigue associated with docetaxel chemotherapy elicits modest improvements .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger , longer term , randomized , controlled studies are required to clarify the exact role of modafinil in the treatment of docetaxel-related fatigue .

BACKGROUND	Sympathectomy is currently used as the fourth step of the modified World Health Organization ( WHO ) analgesic ladder .
BACKGROUND	Sympathectomy can be performed early , before the second step on the ladder .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that early sympathectomy would reduce pain and opioid consumption and improve quality of life .
METHODS	One hundred nine patients , with inoperable abdominal or pelvic cancer , reporting visceral pain of @-@ on a visual analogue scale and taking nonopioid analgesics were allocated randomly into two groups : either blocks were performed before Step @ of the WHO ladder , then analgesics were managed according to the ladder ( Group I ) or analgesics were given according to the WHO ladder , and blocks were performed as the fourth step after failure of strong opioids to control pain ( Group II ) .
METHODS	Visual analogue scale scores , responder analysis , daily opioid consumption , related side effects , and quality of life were assessed .
RESULTS	Responders were significantly higher in Group I ( P < @ ) , and partial responders and nonresponders significantly increased in Group II ( P < @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Opioid consumption significantly decreased in Group I ( P < @ during first @ months and @ at the last assessment time ) , with concomitant significant reduction in related side effects .
RESULTS	The number of patients who had a good analgesic response on tramadol significantly increased in Group I during the first five months ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core @ global quality-of-life subscale scores revealed significant improvement until the fifth month in Group I ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Sympathectomy before Step @ on the WHO analgesic ladder seems to lead to better pain control , less opioid consumption , and better quality of life in cancer patients .

BACKGROUND	Several studies have demonstrated that local ischemic preconditioning can reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac surgery patients ; however , preconditioning has not become a standard cardioprotective intervention , primarily because of the increased risk of atheroembolism during repetitive aortic cross-clamping .
BACKGROUND	In the present study , we aimed to describe and validate a novel technique of preconditioning induction .
METHODS	Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( @ women and @ men ; mean age , @years ) were randomized into @ groups : ( @ ) Controls ( n = @ ) , ( @ ) Perfusion ( n = @ ) , and ( @ ) Preconditioning ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	All patients were operated under cardiopulmonary bypass using normothermic blood cardioplegia .
METHODS	Preconditioning was induced by subjecting the hemodynamically unloaded heart to @cycles of @min of ischemia and @min of reperfusion with normokalemic blood prior to cardioplegia .
METHODS	In the Perfusion group , the heart perfusion remained unaffected for @min .
METHODS	Troponin I ( TnI ) levels were analyzed before surgery , and @ , @ , @h , and @days after surgery .
METHODS	The secondary endpoints included the cardiac index , plasma natriuretic peptide level , and postoperative use of inotropes .
RESULTS	Preconditioning resulted in a significant reduction in the TnI level on the @th postoperative day only ( @ and @ ng/ml in Preconditioning and Perfusion groups , respectively , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , cardiac index was significantly higher in the Preconditioning group than in the Control and Perfusion groups just after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass .
RESULTS	The number of patients requiring inotropic support with@ agents after surgery was significantly lower in the Preconditioning and Perfusion group than in the Control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No complications of the procedure were recorded in the Preconditioning group .
CONCLUSIONS	The preconditioning procedure described can be performed safely in cardiac surgery patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The application of this technique of preconditioning was associated with certain benefits , including improved left ventricular function after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and a reduced need for inotropic support .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the infarct-limiting effect of preconditioning in the early postoperative period was not evident .
CONCLUSIONS	The procedure does not involve repetitive aortic cross-clamping , thus avoiding possible embolic complications .

BACKGROUND	Minimal-change nephrotic syndrome ( MCNS ) is a common cause of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) with frequent relapse .
BACKGROUND	Although steroids and calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) are the cornerstone treatments , the use of rituximab ( RTX ) , a monoclonal antibody targeting B cells , is an efficient and safe alternative in childhood .
METHODS	Because data from adults remain sparse , we conducted a large retrospective and multicentric study that included @ adults with MCNS and receiving RTX .
RESULTS	Complete ( NS remission and withdrawal of all immunosuppressants ) and partial ( NS remission and withdrawal of at least one immunosuppressants ) clinical responses were obtained for @ and @ patients , respectively ( overall response @ % ) , including @ patients that only received RTX and had a complete clinical response .
RESULTS	After a follow-up time of @ months ( @-@ ) , relapses occurred in @ responder patients -LSB- @ % , median time @ months ( @-@ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	Seventeen of these received a second course of RTX and then had a complete ( n = @ ) or partial ( n = @ ) clinical response .
RESULTS	From multivariate analysis , on-going mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) therapy at the time of RTX was the only predictive factor for RTX failure -LSB- HR = @ @ % CI ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Interestingly , nine patients were still in remission at @ months ( @-@ ) after B-cell recovery .
RESULTS	No significant early or late adverse event occurred after RTX therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	RTX is safe and effective in adult patients with MCNS and could be an alternative to steroids or CNIs in patients with a long history of relapsing MCNS .

OBJECTIVE	Extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) of blood during cardiopulmonary surgery has been shown to stimulate various proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines and chemokines .
OBJECTIVE	The biochemical oxidation/reduction pathways of - lipoic acid suggest that it may have antioxidant properties .
METHODS	In this study we aimed to evaluate only patients with coronary heart disease and those planned for coronary artery bypass graft operation .
METHODS	Blood samples were obtained from the patients before the operation ( P@ ) and one ( P@ ) , four ( P@ ) , @ ( P@ ) and @ hours ( P@ ) after administration of - lipoic acid ( LA ) .
METHODS	The patients were divided into two groups , control and LA treatment group .
METHODS	Levels of interleukin - @ ( IL-@ ) and -@ ( IL-@ ) , complement @ ( C@ ) and @ ( C@ ) , anti-streptolysin ( ASO ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and haptoglobin were assessed in the blood samples .
RESULTS	Cytokine IL-@ and IL-@ levels were significantly higher after surgery .
RESULTS	Compared with the control groups , LA significantly decreased IL-@ and IL-@ levels in a time-dependent manner .
RESULTS	CRP levels did not show significant variation in the first three time periods .
RESULTS	CRP levels were higher after surgery , especially in the later periods .
RESULTS	These results demonstrate that CRP formation depends on cytokine release .
RESULTS	C@ and C@ levels were significantly higher after surgery than in the pre-operative period .
RESULTS	LA treatment decreased C@ and C@ levels .
RESULTS	Therefore , LA administration may be useful for the treatment of diseases and processes where excessive cytokine release could cause oxidative damage .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest a possible benefit of using LA during cardiac surgery to reduce cytokine levels .

OBJECTIVE	To study the intraocular distribution and safety of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin after posterior subtenon injection in humans .
METHODS	Prospective , interventional , comparative case series .
METHODS	Six patients ( mean age : @ @ years ) , scheduled to undergo planned uniocular enucleation in aninstitutional setting , were randomly divided into @ groups .
METHODS	Each group received a @mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated .
METHODS	Two eyes were enucleated @ , @ and @ hours post injection .
METHODS	Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation .
METHODS	The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy .
METHODS	The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy .
RESULTS	The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas ( @ @ mg/g ) , up to @ hours post treatment .
RESULTS	The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until @ hours ( @ @ mg/g ) .
RESULTS	The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after @ hours , with negligible amounts at @ hours .
RESULTS	No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy .
RESULTS	Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin , with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans .
CONCLUSIONS	The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity andclinical efficacy .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate effects of preoperative high-dose glucocorticoid on the inflammatory response and recovery after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) .
BACKGROUND	The postimplantation syndrome after EVAR may delay recovery due to the release of proinflammatory mediators .
BACKGROUND	Glucocorticoids may reduce postoperative inflammatory responses and enhance recovery , but with limited information on EVAR .
METHODS	A single-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of @ patients undergoing elective EVAR between November @ and January @ .
METHODS	Patients received @ mg/kg of methylprednisolone ( MP ) ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) preoperatively .
METHODS	Primary outcome was a modified version of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures were the effect on inflammatory biomarkers , morbidity , and time to meet discharge criteria .
RESULTS	Of @ randomized patients , @ ( @ % ) were evaluated for the primary outcome .
RESULTS	MP reduced systemic inflammatory response syndrome from @ % to @ % ( P < @ ) ( number needed to treat = @ ) , maximal plasma interleukin @ from @ pg/mL -LSB- interquartile range ( IQR ) = @-@ pg/mL -RSB- to @ pg/mL ( IQR = @-@ pg/mL ) ( P < @ ) and fulfillment of discharge criteria was shorter -LSB- @ days ( IQR = @-@ days ) vs @ days ( IQR = @-@ days ) -RSB- ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	C-reactive protein , temperature , interleukin @ , and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor were also reduced ( P < @ ) by MP .
RESULTS	Myeloperoxidase , D-dimer , and matrix metalloproteinase @ were not modified .
RESULTS	No differences in @-day medical ( @ % vs @ % ) ( P = @ ) or surgical ( @ % vs @ % ) morbidity were found in the active group versus the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative MP attenuates the inflammatory response with a faster recovery after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysms .
CONCLUSIONS	Further safety and dose-response studies are required to allow recommendations for general practice .

BACKGROUND	Asians are prone to develop epidermal pigmentary lesions as a result of photoaging .
BACKGROUND	Solar lentigines , especially those which are light in color , show somewhat limited response to pigment lasers and intense pulsed light sources .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to compare the early effects as well as side effects of Q-switched Nd : YAG and Er : YAG micropeel in treating light solar lentigines in Asians .
METHODS	This was a split-face , evaluator-blind , randomized controlled study .
METHODS	A single session of treatment was performed on Asian patients with light facial lentigines .
METHODS	Q-switched Nd : YAG laser was allocated to one half of the face , and Er : YAG micropeel to the other half .
METHODS	The response to therapy was evaluated by two independent dermatologists with standardized photographs taken @ weeks and @ month after the laser treatment .
METHODS	Patients ' satisfaction and preference in treatment were also assessed .
RESULTS	Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed .
RESULTS	A reduction in pigment was observed with both lasers during the study period .
RESULTS	The degree of pigment reduction in the Q-switched Nd : YAG treated side of the face was significantly higher than that of the Er : YAG micropeel treated side at @-week follow-up ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The degree of pigment reduction between the Q-switched Nd : YAG-treated side and the Er : YAG micropeel-treated side was similar at @-month follow-up ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While there is no perfect therapy for light solar lentigines , a single session of Q-switched Nd : YAG laser and Er : YAG micropeel was shown to reduce pigmentation .
CONCLUSIONS	The immediate effects ( @-week follow-up ) were better with the Q-switched Nd : YAG laser but there was no great difference between the two laser types at @-month follow-up due to the greater degree of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following Q-switched Nd : YAG .
CONCLUSIONS	Both laser types could be applied either singly in turns , or in combination for maximal efficacy in future .

OBJECTIVE	Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the - subunit of the interleukin-@ receptor with demonstrated benefits in the treatment of multiple sclerosis .
OBJECTIVE	The present work aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab high-yield process ( HYP ) in healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Three double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , phaseI studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab HYP in healthy volunteers following single subcutaneous administration ( @ , @ , or @mg ) , multiple subcutaneous administrations ( @ or @mg biweekly with a @mg loading dose ) , or single intravenous administration ( @ or @mg ) .
METHODS	Measurable serum concentrations ( n = @ ) from @ subjects treated with daclizumab HYP in the three studies were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling .
RESULTS	A two-compartment model with a first-order absorption and elimination adequately described daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetics .
RESULTS	Daclizumab HYP clearance , inter-compartmental clearance , and central and peripheral volumes of distribution were @mL/h , @mL/h , @ L , and @ L , respectively , scaled by -LSB- bodyweight ( kg ) / @ -RSB- with @ and @ exponents for clearance and volume parameters , respectively .
RESULTS	Lag-time , mean absorption time , and absolute bioavailability ( @-@mg ) for subcutaneous administration were @h , @ days , and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Bodyweight explained only ~ @ % of daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetic variability .
RESULTS	With this limited dataset , sex , age , race , or presence of antibodies did not correlate with daclizumab HYP clearance .
RESULTS	The estimated effective half-life was @-@days .
RESULTS	The developed model was robust in bootstrap evaluation and predicted the data adequately in stochastic simulations .
CONCLUSIONS	Daclizumab HYP is characterized by slow clearance , linear pharmacokinetics ( at doses@mg ) , high subcutaneous bioavailability , and a half-life suitable for monthly administration .

BACKGROUND	The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least @ mm Hg during initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock .
BACKGROUND	However , whether this blood-pressure target is more or less effective than a higher target is unknown .
METHODS	In a multicenter , open-label trial , we randomly assigned @ patients with septic shock to undergo resuscitation with a mean arterial pressure target of either @ to @ mm Hg ( high-target group ) or @ to @ mm Hg ( low-target group ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was mortality at day @ .
RESULTS	At @ days , there was no significant between-group difference in mortality , with deaths reported in @ of @ patients in the high-target group ( @ % ) and @ of @ patients in the low-target group ( @ % ) ( hazard ratio in the high-target group , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was also no significant difference in mortality at @ days , with @ deaths ( @ % ) and @ deaths ( @ % ) , respectively ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups ( @ events -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ events -LSB- @ % -RSB- , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was higher in the high-target group than in the low-target group .
RESULTS	Among patients with chronic hypertension , those in the high-target group required less renal-replacement therapy than did those in the low-target group , but such therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Targeting a mean arterial pressure of @ to @ mm Hg , as compared with @ to @ mm Hg , in patients with septic shock undergoing resuscitation did not result in significant differences in mortality at either @ or @ days .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by the French Ministry of Health ; SEPSISPAM ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

OBJECTIVE	The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect on subjects ' temperature measurement readings when using the infrared tympanic thermometer after correct earphone placement and use , with or without music transmission through the earphone .
METHODS	A comparative study design was adopted .
METHODS	A sample of @ healthy people was randomly divided into three groups .
METHODS	Subjects in all groups used an earphone that had been correctly placed in the right ear only : Group @ : listened to heavy metal music through the earphone ( @ participants ) ; Group @ : listened to classical music through the earphone ( @ participants ) ; Group @ : no music or sound was transmitted through the earphone ( @ participants ) .
METHODS	Average differences ( CI @ % ) and Pearson correlations for the temperature measured in the right ear , which was exposed to the different independent variables , and the left ear which was not exposed , were calculated at different times : ( @ ) after @ minutes compared to the baseline measurement ; ( @ ) after @ minutes compared to the @ minutes measurement ; and ( @ ) after @ minutes compared to the baseline measurement .
RESULTS	The inter-ear temperature correlation at the baseline was Pearson r @ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant decrease in the correlations between right and left ear temperatures in Group @ and in Group @ which was demonstrated after @ minutes of earphone use , and reached critical values after @ minutes of use in all groups .
RESULTS	The average warmth in the right ear , as perceived by participants after @ minutes , was reported .
RESULTS	Using the Numerical Rating Score the average was @ + / - @ for Group @ , for Group @ was @ + / - @ and for Group @ was @ + / - @ ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Within the limitations of the study , which involved a limited number of healthy people the results show that it is best to not measure tympanic temperature in an ear that has very recently had an earphone in place .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant anastrozole and fulvestrant treatment of large operable or locally advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer not eligible for initial breast-conserving surgery , and to identify genomic changes occurring after treatment .
METHODS	One hundred and twenty post-menopausal patients were randomised to receive @mg anastrozole ( @ patients ) or @mg fulvestrant ( @ patients ) for @ months .
METHODS	Genomic DNA copy number profiles were generated for a subgroup of @ patients before and after treatment .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were evaluable for efficacy and @ for toxicity .
RESULTS	The objective response rate determined by clinical palpation was @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) in the anastrozole arm and @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) in the fulvestrant arm .
RESULTS	The breast-conserving surgery rate was @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) in the anastrozole arm and @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) in the fulvestrant arm .
RESULTS	Pathological responses > @ % occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) in the anastrozole arm and @ ( @ % ) in the fulvestrant arm .
RESULTS	The Ki-@ score fell after treatment but there was no significant difference between the reduction in the two arms ( anastrozole @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) before , @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) after , n = @ ; fulvestrant @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) before , @ % ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ) after , n = @ ) or between the reduction in Ki-@ in clinical responders and non-responders .
RESULTS	Genomic analysis appeared to show a reduction of clonal diversity following treatment with selection of some clones with simpler copy number profiles .
CONCLUSIONS	Both anastrozole and fulvestrant were effective and well-tolerated , enabling breast-conserving surgery in over @ % of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Clonal changes consistent with clonal selection by the treatment were seen in a subgroup of patients .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the impact of a health psychology-led bariatric rehabilitation service ( BRS ) on patient weight loss following bariatric surgery at @ year .
METHODS	A single-site open-randomised parallel group control trial based at St. Richard 's Hospital in Chichester in the UK .
METHODS	Patients ( n = @ ) were recruited immediately prior to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual ( n = @ ) or the BRS ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The BRS involved three @-min one-to-one sessions with a health psychologist and provided information , support and mentoring pre and post surgery addressing psychological issues such as dietary control , self esteem , coping and emotional eating .
METHODS	Weight loss was assessed at @ year .
METHODS	The key outcome variable was BMI and change in BMI .
RESULTS	Follow-up weight was available for @ patients .
RESULTS	Intention-to-treat analysis ( n = @ ) using last measured weights showed that mean change in BMI by @ year post surgery was -@ .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two groups ( control group = -@ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; intervention = -@ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; p ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , explanatory analysis ( n = @ ) showed a mean change in BMI of -@ .
RESULTS	The difference between the two groups was not significant ( control group = -@ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; intervention = -@ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; p ( @ ) = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Psychological support pre and post bariatric surgery had no impact on weight loss as measured by BMI and change in BMI by @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	It is argued that psychological support should be targeted to patients who start to demonstrate weight regain at a later stage .

BACKGROUND	The Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent is a newly developed third-generation drug-eluting stent , featuring a unique dual-polymer mix .
BACKGROUND	An active bioabsorbable polymer delivers the anti-proliferative drug , sirolimus , via controlled release , while a passive biocompatible polymeric coating shields the metallic strut from surrounding tissue , preventing interaction .
BACKGROUND	To date , the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent has excelled in terms of late lumen loss at @ months in a first-in-man single-arm trial .
BACKGROUND	However , the efficacy and safety data for Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stents in a broader population of all-comers are limited .
BACKGROUND	The present study offers an angiographic and clinical comparison of the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent and the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease .
METHODS	The ORIENT trial is a multicenter , randomized , open-label , parallel-arm study designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent relative to the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with a spectrum of coronary artery disease will undergo prospective , random assignment to a Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent or Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent ( @:@ ratio ) , for a primary endpoint of in-stent late lumen loss at @ months by quantitative coronary angiography .
METHODS	Secondary @-month clinical endpoints are death , target lesion revascularization , target vessel revascularization , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis and target lesion failure ( a composite of cardiac death , target lesion revascularization and target vessel-related myocardial infarction ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The ORIENT trial is the first study to date comparing the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent with the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent for efficacy and safety in a population of all-comers with coronary artery disease .

BACKGROUND	Patients receiving oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) who undergo drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation require additional dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel .
BACKGROUND	Such triple therapy confers an elevated bleeding risk , and its optimal duration is not known .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to evaluate whether shortening the duration of clopidogrel therapy from @ months to @ weeks after DES implantation was associated with a superior net clinical outcome in patients receiving concomitant aspirin and OAC .
METHODS	In this randomized , open-label trial , we enrolled patients receiving OAC who underwent DES implantation at @ European centers between September @ and December @ .
METHODS	A total of @ patients receiving concomitant aspirin and OAC were randomized to either @-week clopidogrel therapy ( n = @ ) or @-month clopidogrel therapy ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was a composite of death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , definite stent thrombosis , stroke , or Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) major bleeding at @ months .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) in the @-week group compared with @ patients ( @ % ) in the @-month group ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences for the secondary combined ischemic endpoint of cardiac death , MI , definite stent thrombosis , and ischemic stroke ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) or the secondary bleeding endpoint of TIMI major bleeding ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Six weeks of triple therapy was not superior to @ months with respect to net clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that physicians should weigh the trade-off between ischemic and bleeding risk when choosing the shorter or longer duration of triple therapy .

BACKGROUND	The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial previously showed that intensive glucose lowering , as compared with standard therapy , did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events among @ military veterans ( median follow-up , @ years ) .
BACKGROUND	We report the extended follow-up of the study participants .
METHODS	After the conclusion of the clinical trial , we followed participants , using central databases to identify procedures , hospitalizations , and deaths ( complete cohort , with follow-up data for @ % of participants ) .
METHODS	Most participants agreed to additional data collection by means of annual surveys and periodic chart reviews ( survey cohort , with @ % follow-up ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the time to the first major cardiovascular event ( heart attack , stroke , new or worsening congestive heart failure , amputation for ischemic gangrene , or cardiovascular-related death ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality .
RESULTS	The difference in glycated hemoglobin levels between the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group averaged @ percentage points during the trial ( median level , @ % vs. @ % ) and declined to @ to @ percentage points by @ years after the trial ended .
RESULTS	Over a median follow-up of @ years , the intensive-therapy group had a significantly lower risk of the primary outcome than did the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ) , with an absolute reduction in risk of @ major cardiovascular events per @ person-years , but did not have reduced cardiovascular mortality ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No reduction in total mortality was evident ( hazard ratio in the intensive-therapy group , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ; median follow-up , @ years ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After nearly @ years of follow-up , patients with type @ diabetes who had been randomly assigned to intensive glucose control for @ years had @ fewer major cardiovascular events per @ person-years than those assigned to standard therapy , but no improvement was seen in the rate of overall survival .

OBJECTIVE	To determine inter - and intra-tester reliability of strength measurements during maximal electrically induced contractions ( MEIC ) using a hand-held dynamometer ( HHD ) .
METHODS	Thirty-seven healthy young female adults , mean age ( SD ) @ ( @ ) years , were tested by two examiners during two sessions , with order of examiners randomized .
METHODS	Biphasic pulses ( phase duration -- @s ; pulse frequency -- @Hz ) were employed in order to induce contractions of the quadriceps femoris muscle at a maximally tolerated current level .
METHODS	Strength of maximal voluntary isometric contractions ( MVIC ) and of MEIC was recorded with a HHD utilizing a stabilization belt .
RESULTS	Good to excellent inter - and intra-tester reliability were determined with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging between @ and @ , and no bias in the Bland-Altman plots .
RESULTS	The @ % repeatability ranged between @ and @ kg for the MVIC and MEIC , and between @ and @ % for the % MVIC .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results confirm previous findings indicating good to excellent reliability of quadriceps femoris muscle MVIC assessment with a HHD .
CONCLUSIONS	However , a high @ % repeatability range indicates the HHD is not sufficiently reliable as an indicator of the force level attained during electrically induced contractions .
CONCLUSIONS	Other methods need to be investigated to assist in determining whether MEIC have reached therapeutic levels .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of a @-week supplementation between two different mixtures of antioxidants and placebo on aerobic exercise performance in acute normobaric hypoxia .
METHODS	Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive a broad-based antioxidants supplement containing beta-carotene , ascorbic acid , d-alpha-tocopherol-succinate , N-acetylcysteine , riboflavin , zinc , and selenium ( antioxidant capsule group -LSB- AO group -RSB- ) , or a combination of alpha-ketoglutaric acid ( - KG ) and @-hydroxymethylfurfural ( @-HMF ; CYL concentrate supplementation group -LSB- CS group -RSB- ) , or placebo ( PL group ) .
METHODS	Before and after supplementation , subjects performed two incremental cycle-exercise tests until exhaustion .
METHODS	The first test was conducted under normoxic conditions ( LA , FiO@ of @ % , ~ @ m ) and the second after the @-week supplementation period under normobaric hypoxic conditions ( AHA , FiO@ of @ % , ~ @m ) .
RESULTS	In CS peak cycling performance ( peak power ) declined from LA to AHA @ % ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) less compared with PL ( p = @ ) and @ % ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) less compared with AO ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Better maintenance of aerobic exercise capacity in CS was associated with an attenuated reduction in maximal heart rate in hypoxia .
CONCLUSIONS	Aerobic exercise performance was less impaired in acute normobaric hypoxia after @ weeks with supplementation of - KG and @-HMF compared with a broad-based antioxidants supplement or PL .

BACKGROUND	Transradial access ( TRA ) has been associated with reduced access site-related bleeding complications and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
BACKGROUND	It is unclear , however , whether these observed benefits are influenced by baseline bleeding risk .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the relationship between baseline bleeding risk , TRA utilization , and procedure-related outcomes in patients undergoing PCI enrolled in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database .
METHODS	Baseline bleeding risk was calculated by using modified Mehran bleeding risk scores in @,@ PCI procedures performed between @ and @ .
METHODS	Four categories for bleeding risk were defined for the modified Mehran risk score ( MMRS ) : low ( < @ ) , moderate ( @ to @ ) , high ( @ to @ ) , and very high ( @ ) .
METHODS	The impact of baseline bleeding risk on @-day mortality and its relationship with access site were studied .
RESULTS	TRA was independently associated with a @ % reduction in @-day mortality risk ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- : @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ to @ -RSB- ; p < @ ) , with the magnitude of mortality reduction related to baseline bleeding risk ( MMRS < @ , OR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @ to @ -RSB- ; MMRS @ , OR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @ to @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	In patients with an MMRS < @ , TRA was used in @,@ ( @ % ) of @,@ PCI procedures ; TRA was used in @,@ ( @ % ) of @,@ PCI procedures in patients with an MMRS @ , illustrating that TRA was used less in those at highest risk from bleeding complications ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	TRA was independently associated with reduced @-day mortality , and the magnitude of this effect was related to baseline bleeding risk ; those at highest risk of bleeding complications gained the greatest benefit from adoption of TRA during PCI .

BACKGROUND	Patients with severe acute exacerbations of asthma often receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to determine whether serum procalcitonin ( PCT ) levels can effectively and safely reduce antibiotic exposure in patients experiencing exacerbations of asthma .
METHODS	In this randomized controlled trial , a total of @ patients requiring hospitalization for severe acute exacerbations of asthma were screened for eligibility to participate and @ completed the @-month follow-up visit .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to either PCT-guided ( PCT group ) or standard ( control group ) antimicrobial therapy .
METHODS	In the control group , patients received antibiotics according to the attending physician 's discretion ; in the PCT group , patients received antibiotics according to an algorithm based on serum PCT levels .
METHODS	The primary end point was antibiotic exposure ; secondary end points were clinical recovery , length of hospital stay , clinical and laboratory parameters , spirometry , number of asthma exacerbations , emergency room visits , hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma .
RESULTS	PCT guidance reduced antibiotic prescription ( @ % versus @ % , respectively ; P < @ ) and antibiotic exposure ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P < @ ) compared to standard therapy .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in clinical recovery , length of hospital stay or clinical , laboratory and spirometry outcomes in both groups .
RESULTS	Number of asthma exacerbations , emergency room visits , hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma were similar during the @-month follow-up period .
CONCLUSIONS	A PCT-guided strategy allows antibiotic exposure to be reduced in patients with severe acute exacerbation of asthma without apparent harm .

BACKGROUND	Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) bronchiolitis in infancy is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma .
BACKGROUND	Because azithromycin attenuated neutrophilic airway inflammation in a murine viral bronchiolitis model , demonstration of similar effects in human subjects might provide a strategy for the prevention of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to investigate whether azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduces serum and nasal lavage IL-@ levels and the occurrence of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing .
METHODS	We performed a randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial in @ otherwise healthy infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis who were treated with azithromycin or placebo for @ days .
METHODS	IL-@ levels were measured in nasal lavage fluid and serum on randomization , day @ , and day @ ( nasal lavage only ) .
METHODS	The occurrence of wheezing episodes was assessed monthly over the ensuing @ weeks .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , azithromycin treatment did not reduce serum IL-@ levels at day @ ( P = @ ) but resulted in a greater decrease in nasal lavage fluid IL-@ levels by day @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Twenty-two percent of azithromycin-treated participants experienced at least @ wheezing episodes compared with @ % of participants in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Azithromycin treatment resulted in prolonged time to the third wheezing episode ( P = @ ) and in fewer days with respiratory symptoms over the subsequent year in comparison with placebo ( @ vs @ days , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this proof-of-concept study azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduced upper airway IL-@ levels , prolonged the time to the third wheezing episode , and reduced overall respiratory morbidity over the subsequent year .

OBJECTIVE	Changes in pulmonary dynamics following laparotomy are well documented .
OBJECTIVE	Deep breathing exercises , with or without incentive spirometry , may help counteract postoperative decreased vital capacity ; however , the evidence for the role of incentive spirometry in the prevention of postoperative atelectasis is inconclusive .
OBJECTIVE	Furthermore , data are scarce regarding the prevention of postoperative atelectasis in sub-Saharan Africa .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of the use of incentive spirometry on pulmonary function following exploratory laparotomy as measured by forced vital capacity ( FVC ) .
METHODS	This was a single-center , randomized clinical trial performed at Kamuzu Central Hospital , Lilongwe , Malawi .
METHODS	Study participants were adult patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy and were randomized into the intervention or control groups ( standard of care ) from February @ to November @ , @ .
METHODS	All patients received routine postoperative care , including instructions for deep breathing and early ambulation .
METHODS	We used bivariate analysis to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups .
METHODS	Adult patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy participated in postoperative deep breathing exercises .
METHODS	Patients in the intervention group received incentive spirometers .
METHODS	We assessed pulmonary function using a peak flow meter to measure FVC in both groups of patients .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes , such as hospital length of stay and mortality , were obtained from the medical records .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were randomized ( @ in each arm ) .
RESULTS	The median age in the intervention and control groups was @ years ( interquartile range , @-@ years ) and @ years ( interquartile range , @-@ years ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Men predominated in both groups , and most patients underwent emergency procedures ( @ % in the intervention group and @ % in the control group ) .
RESULTS	Mean initial FVC did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups ( @ and @ L , respectively ; P = @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Although patients in the intervention group tended to have higher final FVC measurements , the change between the first and last measured FVC was not statistically significant ( @ and @ L , respectively ; P = @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Likewise , hospital length of stay did not differ significantly between groups .
RESULTS	Overall postoperative mortality was @ % , with a higher mortality rate in the control group compared with the intervention group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ; P = @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Education and provision of incentive spirometry for unmonitored patient use does not result in statistically significant improvement in pulmonary dynamics following laparotomy .
CONCLUSIONS	We would not recommend the addition of incentive spirometry to the current standard of care in this resource-constrained environment .

BACKGROUND	Antisocial behaviour and adult criminality often have their origins in childhood and are best addressed early in the child 's life using evidence-based treatments such as the ` Incredible Years Parent Programme ' .
BACKGROUND	However , families with additional risk factors who are at highest risk for poor outcomes do not always make sufficient change while attending such programmes .
BACKGROUND	Additional support to address barriers and improve implementation of positive parenting strategies while these families attend the Incredible Years Programme may improve overall outcomes.The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of adding a structured home visiting intervention ( Home Parent Support ) to improve outcomes in families most at risk of poor treatment response from the Incredible Years intervention .
BACKGROUND	This study will inform the design of a larger prospective randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	A pilot single-blind , parallel , superiority , randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Randomisation will be undertaken using a computer-generated sequence in a @:@ ratio to the two treatments arranged in permuted blocks with stratification by age , sex , and ethnicity .
METHODS	One hundred and twenty six participants enrolled in the Incredible Years Parent Programme who meet the high-risk criteria will be randomly allocated to receive either Incredible Years Parent Programme and Home Parent Support , or the Incredible Years Parent Programme alone .
METHODS	The Home Parent Support is a @-session structured home visiting intervention provided by a trained therapist , alongside the usual Incredible Years Parent Programme , to enhance the adoption of key parenting skills .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the change in child behaviour from baseline to post-intervention in parent reported Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory Problem Scale .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first formal evaluation of adding Home Parent Support alongside Incredible Years Parent Programme for families with risk factors who typically have poorer treatment outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	We anticipate that the intervention will help vulnerable families stay engaged , strengthen the adoption of effective parenting strategies , and improve outcomes for both the children and families .

BACKGROUND	Childhood obesity is a growing concern in Sweden .
BACKGROUND	Children with overweight and obesity run a high risk of becoming obese as adults , and are likely to develop comorbidities .
BACKGROUND	Despite the immense demand , there is still a lack of evidence-based comprehensive prevention programmes targeting pre-school children and their families in primary health care settings .
BACKGROUND	The aims are to describe the design and methodology of the PRIMROSE cluster-randomised controlled trial , assess the relative validity of a food frequency questionnaire , and describe the baseline characteristics of the eligible young children and their mothers .
METHODS	The PRIMROSE trial targets first-time parents and their children at Swedish child health centres ( CHC ) in eight counties in Sweden .
METHODS	Randomisation is conducted at the CHC unit level .
METHODS	CHC nurses employed at the participating CHC received training in carrying out the intervention alongside their provision of regular services .
METHODS	The intervention programme , starting when the child is @-@months of age and ending at age @ , is based on social cognitive theory and employs motivational interviewing .
METHODS	Primary outcomes are children 's body mass index and waist circumference at fouryears .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes are children 's and mothers ' eating habits ( assessed by a food frequency questionnaire ) , and children 's and mothers ' physical activity ( measured by accelerometer and a validated questionnaire ) , and mothers ' body mass index and waist circumference .
CONCLUSIONS	The on-going population-based PRIMROSE trial , which targets childhood obesity , is embedded in the regular national ( routine ) preventive child health services that are available free-of-charge to all young families in Sweden .
CONCLUSIONS	Of the participants ( n = @ ) , @ intervention and @ control mothers ( @ % ) responded to the validated physical activity and food frequency questionnaire at baseline ( i.e. , before the first intervention session , or , for children in the control group , before they reached @months of age ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The food frequency questionnaire showed acceptable relative validity when compared with an @-day food diary .
CONCLUSIONS	We are not aware of any previous RCT , concerned with the primary prevention of childhood obesity through sessions at CHC that addresses healthy eating habits and physical activity in the context of a routine child health services programme .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of lutein supplementation on plasma lutein concentrations and the macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) in central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) .
METHODS	In this double-masked placebo-controlled study , @ patients received lutein @ mg/d and @ received placebo .
METHODS	The plasma lutein concentration and MPOD using autofluorescence spectrometry ( density unit , DU ) were measured at baseline and @ and @ months .
RESULTS	The mean plasma lutein concentrations and MPOD values in the lutein and control groups , respectively , were @ and @ ng/mL and @ and @ DU at baseline ; @ and @ ng/mL and @ and @ DU at @ month ; and @ and @ ng/mL and @ and @ DU at @ months .
RESULTS	The plasma concentration in the lutein group was significantly higher than in controls at @ and @ months ( P < @ for both comparisons ) ; however , the MPOD values did not differ significantly between groups at @ ( P = @ ) or @ months ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In patients with a plasma lutein concentration below the mean level in @ age-matched healthy subjects ( mean @ ng/mL ; n = @ in lutein group , n = @ in control group ) , the control MPOD values significantly ( P = @ ) decreased at @ months ( mean baseline , @ DU ; @ months , @ DU ) .
RESULTS	The MPOD in the lutein group remained at the baseline level ( mean baseline , @ DU ; @ months , @ DU ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The MPOD did not increase in patients with CSC with short-term lutein supplementation ; however , among patients with low plasma lutein , supplemental lutein prevented a decline in MPOD that was observed in control subjects ( www.umin.ac.jp/ctr number , UMIN@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Fluid therapy is widely used in critically ill patients to restore effective intravascular volume and improve organ perfusion .
BACKGROUND	Recent studies have questioned the administration of colloid-based solutions , especially if containing hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) , in different ICU populations ; however , there is still uncertainty on the use of colloids as initial fluid therapy for early resuscitation .
METHODS	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different resuscitation fluid strategies on the mortality of patients with shock .
METHODS	In a multicentric ( @ ICUs ) , controlled , open-label trial ( from February @ to August @ ) , the authors randomized patients with signs of acute hypovolemia , defined by the combination of hypotension , evidence of low filling pressures or cardiac index and at least two signs of tissue hypoperfusion ( such as altered consciousness , mottled skin , oliguria , lactate levels > @ mmol/L ) , to received either a colloid - or crystalloid-based therapy .
METHODS	Both cohorts received maintenance fluids consisting in isotonic crystalloids and albumin in case of severe hypoalbuminemia ( < @ g/dL ) .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria included previous fluid therapy , pregnancy , brain death , extended burns , chronic hemodialysis or liver disease , known coagulopathy , acute anaphylaxis , dehydration and hypotension due to sedative drugs .
RESULTS	Among the @ eligible patients , @ were eventually randomized in one of the two groups .
RESULTS	The @-day mortality was @ % in the colloid and @ % in the crystalloid group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the sub-group analysis , similar mortality rates were reported for shock due to hypovolemia , sepsis or trauma .
RESULTS	Also , the use of continuous renal replacement therapy was similar between groups ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were more days alive without mechanical ventilation or vasopressors during the first @ and @ days and a lower @-day mortality in the colloid group .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that mortality was not increased and probably decreased with the use of colloids in different forms of shock requiring early fluid resuscitation .
CONCLUSIONS	We discussed herein some methodological issues that may explain the discrepancies of this trial with the other studies developed in the same field .

BACKGROUND	Cochlear implantation with the aim of hearing preservation for combined electric-acoustic stimulation ( EAS ) is the therapy of choice for patients with residual low-frequency hearing .
BACKGROUND	Preserved residual acoustic hearing has a positive effect on speech intelligibility in difficult noise conditions .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to assess speech reception thresholds in various complex noise conditions for patients with EAS in comparison with patients using bilateral cochlear implants ( CI ) .
METHODS	Speech perception in noise was measured for bilateral CI and EAS patient groups .
METHODS	A total of @ listeners with normal hearing served as a control group .
METHODS	Speech reception thresholds ( SRT ) were measured using a closed-set sentence matrix test .
METHODS	Speech was presented with a single source in frontal position ; noise was presented in frontal position or in a multisource noise field ( MSNF ) consisting of a four-loudspeaker array with independent noise sources .
METHODS	Modulated speech-simulating noise and pseudocontinuous noise served respectively as interference signal with different temporal characteristics .
RESULTS	The average SRTs in the EAS group were significantly better in all test conditions than those of the group with bilateral CI .
RESULTS	Both user groups showed significant improvement in the MSNF condition compared with the frontal noise condition as a result of bilateral interaction .
RESULTS	The normal-hearing control group was able to use short temporal gaps in modulated noise to improve speech perception in noise ( gap listening ) .
RESULTS	This effect was absent in both implanted user groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with combined EAS in one ear and a hearing aid in the contralateral ear show significantly improved speech perception in complex noise conditions compared with bilateral CI recipients .

BACKGROUND	Patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) are particularly relevant in influenza vaccine trials in the elderly where reduction in symptom severity could prevent illness-related functional impairment .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate PROs in people aged @ years receiving two different vaccines .
METHODS	This was a phase III , randomised , observer-blind study ( NCT@ ) of the AS@-adjuvanted inactivated trivalent split-virion influenza vaccine ( AS@-TIV ) versus non-adjuvanted vaccine ( TIV ) .
METHODS	Using the FluiiQ questionnaire , symptom ( systemic , respiratory , total ) and life impact ( activities , emotions , relationships ) scores were computed as exploratory endpoints , with minimal important difference ( MID ) in influenza severity between vaccines considered post-hoc as > @ % .
METHODS	Vaccine efficacy of AS@-TIV relative to TIV in severe influenza ( hospitalisation , complication , most severe one-third of episodes based on the area under the curve for systemic symptom score ) was calculated post-hoc .
METHODS	The main analyses ( descriptive ) were conducted in the according-to-protocol cohort ( n = @ AS@-TIV , n = @ TIV ) for influenza confirmed by culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction .
RESULTS	Mean systemic symptom , total symptom and impact on activities scores were lower with AS@-TIV versus TIV .
RESULTS	Mean respiratory symptom , impact on emotions and impact on relationships scores were similar .
RESULTS	Influenza tended to be less severe with AS@-TIV , but the MID was reached only for impact on activities ( mean @ % ) .
RESULTS	Relative vaccine efficacy in severe influenza was @ % ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	AS@-TIV had advantages over TIV in impact on systemic symptoms and activities as measured by the FluiiQ in elderly people .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher efficacy of AS@-TIV relative to TIV was shown for prevention of severe illness .

BACKGROUND	Dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of fruits and vegetables , whole grains , low-fat dairy products , and low glycemic load have been associated with lower type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) risk .
BACKGROUND	In contrast , dietary patterns that include high intakes of refined grains , processed meats , and high amounts of added sugars have been associated with increased T@DM risk .
OBJECTIVE	This randomized , @-period crossover trial compared the effects of dairy and sugar-sweetened product ( SSP ) consumption on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic - cell function in men and women at risk of the development of T@DM who habitually consume sugar-sweetened beverages .
METHODS	In a randomized , controlled crossover trial , participants consumed dairy products ( @ mL/d @ % milk and @ g/d low-fat yogurt ) and SSPs ( @ mL/d nondiet soda and @ g/d nondairy pudding ) , each for @ wk , with a @-wk washout between treatments .
METHODS	A liquid meal tolerance test ( LMTT ) was administered at baseline and the end of each period .
RESULTS	Participants were @ % female with a mean age and body mass index of @ y and @ kg/m ( @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Changes from baseline were significantly different between dairy product and SSP conditions for median homeostasis model assessment @-insulin sensitivity ( HOMA@ - % S ) ( @ vs. -@ % , respectively , P = @ ; baseline = @ % ) , mean LMTT disposition index ( -@ vs. -@ , respectively , P = @ ; baseline = @ ) , mean HDL cholesterol ( @ vs. -@ % , respectively , P = @ ; baseline = @ mg/dL ) , and mean serum @-hydroxyvitamin D -LSB- @ ( OH ) D -RSB- ( @ vs. -@ , respectively , P = @ ; baseline = @ g/L ) .
RESULTS	Changes from baseline in LMTT Matsuda insulin sensitivity index ( -@ vs. -@ , respectively ; baseline = @ ) and mean HOMA@ -- cell function ( -@ vs. @ % , respectively ; baseline = @ % ) did not differ significantly between treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that SSP consumption is associated with less favorable values for HOMA@ - % S , LMTT disposition index , HDL cholesterol , and serum @ ( OH ) D in men and women at risk of T@DM vs. baseline values and values during dairy product consumption .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Progressive decline of psychophysical cone-mediated measures has been reported in type @ ( USH@ ) and type @ ( USH@ ) Usher syndrome .
OBJECTIVE	Conventional cone electroretinogram ( ERG ) responses in USH demonstrate poor signal-to-noise ratio .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated cone signals in USH@ and USH@ by recording microvolt level cycle-by-cycle ( CxC ) ERG .
METHODS	Responses of molecularly genotyped USH@ ( n = @ ) and USH@ ( n = @ ) subjects ( age range , @-@ years ) were compared with those of controls ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	A subset of USH@ ( n = @ ) and USH@ ( n = @ ) subjects was examined two to four times over @ to @ years .
METHODS	Photopic CxC ERG and conventional @-Hz flicker ERG were recorded on the same visits .
RESULTS	Usher syndrome subjects showed considerable cone flicker ERG amplitude losses and timing phase delays ( P < @ ) compared with controls .
RESULTS	USH@ and USH@ had similar rates of progressive logarithmic ERG amplitude decline with disease duration ( -@ log V/y ) .
RESULTS	Of interest , ERG phase delays did not progress over time .
RESULTS	Two USH@C subjects retained normal response timing despite reduced amplitudes .
RESULTS	The CxC ERG method provided reliable responses in all subjects , whereas conventional ERG was undetectable in @ of @ subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Cycle-by-cycle ERG showed progressive loss of amplitude in both USH@ and USH@ subjects , comparable to that reported with psychophysical measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Usher subjects showed abnormal ERG response latency , but this changed less than amplitude with time .
CONCLUSIONS	In USH syndrome , CxC ERG is more sensitive than conventional ERG and warrants consideration as an outcome measure in USH treatment trials .

METHODS	This was a single-center , openlabel , multiple-dose , two-period , complete crossover study that randomized healthy Japanese and , age and weight matched Caucasian subjects to QMF@ @/@ g or @/@ g once daily ( o.d. ) for @ days in each period .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) were assessed up to @ hours on days @ and @ .
RESULTS	@ Japanese and @ Caucasian healthy subjects were enrolled .
RESULTS	Indacaterol and MF had similar PK profiles across both the doses and both ethnic groups .
RESULTS	The maximum geometric mean ratios ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) ) for Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects for Cmax were @ ( @ - @ ) and @ ( @ - @ ) for indacaterol and MF , respectively .
RESULTS	For AUC , the maximum ratios were @ ( @ - @ ) and @ ( @ - @ ) for indacaterol and MF , respectively .
RESULTS	The mild trend towards higher exposure in Japanese subjects could be explained by the fact that the mean body weight was @ % higher for Caucasians compared to their Japanese counterparts .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events or discontinuations related to study medication were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	The study demonstrated increase of mean exposure parameters in Japanese subjects vs. Caucasian subjects , which ranged between @ - @ % and @ - @ % , for indacaterol and MF components , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Multiple doses of both the QMF@ dose levels were safe and well-tolerated in all subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Body weight was considered a key contributory factor for the observed difference in exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest no dose adjustment for QMF@ is required in Asian populations .

BACKGROUND	Sarcopenia is currently best described as an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function .
BACKGROUND	However , no consensus exists as to how to best quantify muscle function in older adults .
BACKGROUND	The muscle quality index ( MQI ) was recently recommended as an ideal evidence-based assessment of functional status in older adults .
BACKGROUND	Nevertheless , the usefulness of MQI to assess physical function is limited by whether it is reflective of muscle qualitative changes to an intervention .
BACKGROUND	Thus , the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MQI changes in response to resistance exercise training and detraining and how such changes correspond to other recommended measures of physical function proposed by suggested definitions of sarcopenia .
METHODS	Twenty-five older adults ( @ y ; BMI = @ kgm ( -@ ) ) completed a @-week resistance training program in a wait-list controlled , cross-over design .
METHODS	MQI was determined as power output from timed sit to stand ( STS ) , body mass , and leg length .
METHODS	Gait speed , hand grip strength , get-up-and-go and lean body mass ( LBM ) were evaluated before and after exercise training and detraining .
METHODS	MQI and functional changes to training and detraining were evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA and clinical interpretations of magnitude based inferences .
RESULTS	Short term resistance training significantly and clinically improved MQI ( @ to @ W ) , gait time ( @ to @ s ) and sit to stand performance ( @ to @ s ) .
RESULTS	Changes in LBM and hand grip strength were not significant or clinically meaningful .
RESULTS	De-training for @-weeks did not result in significant changes in any measure from post-training performance .

BACKGROUND	The decreased number and senescence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) are considered markers of vascular senescence associated with aging , atherosclerosis , and coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in elderly .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we explore the role of vascular senescence in premature CAD ( PCAD ) in a developing country by comparing the numerical status and senescence of circulating EPCs in PCAD patients to controls .
METHODS	EPCs were measured by flow cytometry in @ patients with angiographically documented CAD , and @ controls without evidence of CAD , recruited from random patients @ years of age at All India Institute of Medical Sciences .
METHODS	EPC senescence as determined by telomere length ( EPC-TL ) and telomerase activity ( EPC-TA ) was studied by real time polymerase chain reaction ( q PCR ) and PCR - ELISA respectively .
RESULTS	The number of EPCs ( @ % Vs. @ % of total WBCs , p < @ ) , and EPC-TL ( @ Vs. @ kb/genome , p = @ ) were markedly lower in PCAD patients compared to controls .
RESULTS	These differences persisted after adjustment for age , sex , BMI , smoking and medications .
RESULTS	EPC-TA was reduced in PCAD patients , but was statistically significant only after adjustment for confounding factors ( @ Vs. @ IU/cell , unadjusted p = @ , adjusted p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We observed an association between increased vascular cell senescence with PCAD in a sample of young patients from India .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that early accelerated vascular cell senescence may play an important mechanistic role in CAD epidemic in developing countries like India where PCAD burden is markedly higher compared to developed countries .

BACKGROUND	Inpatient medical settings offer an opportunistic environment for initiating smoking cessation interventions to patients reflecting on their health .
BACKGROUND	Current evidence has shown the superior efficacy of varenicline tartrate ( VT ) for smoking cessation compared with other tobacco cessation therapies ; however , recent evidence also has highlighted concerns about the safety and tolerability of VT. .
BACKGROUND	Given these apprehensions , we aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VT plus quitline-counseling compared to quitline-counseling alone in the inpatient medical setting .
METHODS	Adult patients ( n = @ , @-@ years ) admitted with a smoking-related illnesses to @ hospitals were randomized to receive either @ weeks of varenicline tartrate ( titrated from @ mg daily to @mg twice daily ) plus quitline-counseling ( VT+C ) , ( n = @ ) or quitline-counseling alone ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	VT was well tolerated in the inpatient setting among subjects admitted with acute smoking-related illnesses ( mean age @ and @ years in the VT+C and counseling alone groups , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The most common self-reported adverse event during the @-week treatment phase was nausea ( @ % in the VT+C group compared with @ % in the counseling alone group ) .
RESULTS	Thirteen deaths occurred during the study period ( n = @ were in the VT+C arm compared with n = @ in the counseling alone arm ) .
RESULTS	All of these subjects had known comorbidities or developed underlying comorbidities .
CONCLUSIONS	VT appears to be a safe and well-tolerated opportunistic treatment for inpatient smokers who have related chronic disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the proven efficacy of varenicline from outpatient studies and our recent inpatient evidence , we suggest it be considered as part of standard care in the hospital setting .

OBJECTIVE	Although the VITA @D-Master ( @D ) shade guide offers improved shade-matching performance , many dental materials are only available in VITA Classical ( VC ) shades .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to clarify whether it is possible to convert @D shades determined by observers into VC shades ( indirect method ) without adding a clinically significant error in comparison with direct shade determination using the VC shade guide .
METHODS	Forty ceramic specimens were fabricated .
METHODS	L * a * b * values were recorded using a spectroradiometer .
METHODS	Sixty participants ( @ dentists , @ technicians , and @ students ) were recruited and asked to determine the shades of specimens using the VC and @D shade guides under standardized conditions .
METHODS	Conversion tables were constructed by allocating the closest VC shade tab to every matched @D shade and by use of an optimization algorithm ( indirect methods ) .
METHODS	Differences between E values for VC matches and for the indirect methods were evaluated using t tests .
RESULTS	A mean E ( SD ) of @ ( @ ) for VC and @ ( @ ) for @D was observed ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with direct shade matching using VC , the indirect method with the optimized tables resulted in a mean E of @ ( @ ) , which was not significantly different ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Within the limitations of this study , the conversion tables were suitable for the determination of tooth color using the @D shade guide followed by conversion into VC shades without adding a clinically significant error .

BACKGROUND	It has been well documented that the maturing oocyte is very vulnerable to changes in its micro-environment , the follicular fluid ( FF ) .
BACKGROUND	Recent research has focused on different components within this FF , like hormones , growth factors and metabolites , and how their concentrations are altered by diet and the metabolic health of the mother .
BACKGROUND	It has been proposed that fatty acids ( FAs ) are potential factors that influence oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development .
BACKGROUND	However , a thorough study of the specific FF FA composition per lipid fraction and how this may be affected by BMI is currently lacking .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we investigated the BMI-related concentration of FAs in the phospholipid ( PL ) , cholesteryl-ester ( CHE ) , triglyceride ( TG ) and non-esterified ( NE ) lipid fraction in the FF of women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment ( ART ) .
METHODS	In this descriptive cross-sectional study , the FF of normal weight ( @ BMI < @ kg/m ( @ ) , n = @ ) , overweight ( @ BMI < @ kg/m ( @ ) , n = @ ) and obese ( BMI@ @ kg/m ( @ ) , n = @ ) women , undergoing ART , was sampled and analyzed for @ specific FAs in the PL , CHE , TG and NEFA fraction , using a gas chromatographic analysis method .
METHODS	Differences between BMI-groups were studied by means of univariate general linear models and post hoc Sheff tests .
RESULTS	Total FA concentrations in the PL and CHE fraction did not differ between BMI groups .
RESULTS	Total TG concentrations tended to differ and total NEFA concentrations differed significantly between BMI groups .
RESULTS	Interestingly , @ % and @ % of the total FAs was esterified in the PL and CHE fraction , respectively , while only @ % were present in both the TG and NEFA fraction .
RESULTS	Only few individual FA concentrations differed in the PL , CHE and TG fraction between BMI groups , whereas abundant BMI-related differences were found in the NEFA fraction .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data show that differences in BMI are associated with alterations in the FA composition of the FF , an effect most pronounced in the NEFA fraction .
CONCLUSIONS	These BMI-related variations could possibly affect granulosa cell viability , oocyte developmental competence and subsequent embryo quality possibly explaining differences in oocyte quality in obese patients described by others .

BACKGROUND	This randomised phase II trial compared dose-escalated weekly paclitaxel ( wPTX ) vs standard-dose wPTX for patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) .
METHODS	Ninety patients were randomised to a standard dose of wPTX ( @mgm ( -@ ) ) or an escalated dose of wPTX ( @-@mgm ( -@ ) ) to assess the superiority of overall survival ( OS ) with a one-sided alpha error of @ and a power of @ .
RESULTS	The median OS showed a trend towards longer survival in the dose-escalated arm ( @ vs @ months ; hazard ratio ( HR ) , @ ; one-sided P = @ ) , although it was statistically not significant .
RESULTS	The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was significantly longer in the dose-escalated arm ( @ vs @ months , HR , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Objective response rate was @ % with dose escalation and @ % with standard dose ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The frequency of all grades of neutropenia was significantly higher with dose escalation ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) ; however , no significant difference was observed in the proportion of patients experiencing grade @ or more ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dose-escalated wPTX in patients with pretreated AGC met our predefined threshold of primary end point , OS ( P < @ ) ; however , it did not show a significantly longer OS .
CONCLUSIONS	Progression-free survival was significantly better with dose escalation .

BACKGROUND	Abdominal obesity and exaggerated postprandial lipemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and mortality , and both are affected by dietary behavior .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether dietary supplementation with whey protein and medium-chain saturated fatty acids ( MC-SFAs ) improved postprandial lipid metabolism in humans with abdominal obesity .
METHODS	We conducted a @-wk , randomized , double-blinded , diet intervention study .
METHODS	Sixty-three adults were randomly allocated to one of @ diets in a @ @ factorial design .
METHODS	Participants consumed @ g milk protein ( whey or casein ) and @ g milk fat ( with high or low MC-SFA content ) daily .
METHODS	Before and after the intervention , a high-fat meal test was performed .
METHODS	We measured changes from baseline in fasting and postprandial triacylglycerol , apolipoprotein B-@ ( apoB-@ ; reflecting chylomicrons of intestinal origin ) , free fatty acids ( FFAs ) , insulin , glucose , glucagon , glucagon-like peptide @ ( GLP-@ ) , and gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) .
METHODS	Furthermore , changes in the expression of adipose tissue genes involved in lipid metabolism were investigated .
METHODS	Two-factor ANOVA was used to examine the difference between protein types and fatty acid compositions , as well as any interaction between the two .
RESULTS	Fifty-two participants completed the study .
RESULTS	We found that the postprandial apoB-@ response decreased significantly after whey compared with casein ( P = @ ) independently of fatty acid composition .
RESULTS	Furthermore , supplementation with casein resulted in a significant increase in the postprandial GLP-@ response compared with whey ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	We found no difference in postprandial triacylglycerol , FFA , insulin , glucose , glucagon , or GIP related to protein type or MC-SFA content .
RESULTS	We observed no interaction between milk protein and milk fat on postprandial lipemia .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that a whey protein supplement decreased the postprandial chylomicron response compared with casein in persons with abdominal obesity , thereby indicating a beneficial impact on CVD risk .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Compare the effects of resistance training volume on the maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , functional performance , and muscle strength in elderly women .
METHODS	Thirty elderly women were randomly assigned to a group performing either single sets ( @-SET ) or three sets ( @-SET ) of exercises .
METHODS	The sit-to-stand test , MIP , MEP , and muscle strength were assessed before and after @ training sessions .
METHODS	Progressive resistance training was performed two times per week for a total of @-@ repetitions , using the main muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs .
RESULTS	The main results showed that the participants significantly increased their MEP ( P < @ ; @-SET : @ % ; @-SET : @ % ) and MIP ( P < @ ; @-SET : @ % ; @-SET : @ % ) .
RESULTS	Both groups also improved in the sit-to-stand test ( P < @ ; @-SET : @ % ; @-SET : @ % ) .
RESULTS	After @ training sessions , muscle strength also significantly increased ( P < @ ; @ % -@ % ) in both groups .
RESULTS	An intergroup comparison did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the parameters analyzed .
CONCLUSIONS	Single - and multiple-set resistance training programs increased MIP , MEP , muscle strength , and sit-to-stand test performance in elderly women after @ sessions of training .
CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , our results suggested that elderly women who are not in the habit of physical activity may start with single-set resistance training programs as a short-term strategy for the maintenance of health .

OBJECTIVE	Infliximab , a tumor necrosis factor antagonist , is effective for treating patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to determine whether dosing based on therapeutic drug monitoring increases rate of remission and whether continued concentration-based dosing is superior to clinically based dosing of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with CD and UC .
METHODS	We performed a @-year randomized controlled trial at a tertiary referral center , including @ adults ( @ with CD and @ with UC ) with stable responses to maintenance infliximab therapy .
METHODS	Doses were escalated or reduced using an algorithm to reach a target trough concentration ( TC ) of @-@ g/mL in all patients ( optimization phase ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to groups that received infliximab dosing based on their clinical features ( n = @ ) or continued dosing based on TCs ( n = @ ) ( maintenance phase ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was clinical and biochemical remission at @ year after the optimization phase .
RESULTS	At screening , @ of @ patients had a TC of infliximab of @-@ g/mL ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Of @ patients with TCs < @ g/mL , @ patients ( @ % ) achieved TCs of @-@ g/mL after dose escalation .
RESULTS	This resulted in a higher proportion of CD patients in remission than before dose escalation ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) and a decrease in the median concentration of C-reactive protein , compared with before the dose increase ( @ vs @ mg/L ; P < @ ) ; these changes were not observed in patients with UC .
RESULTS	Of @ patients with TCs > @ g/mL , @ patients ( @ % ) achieved TCs of @-@ g/mL after dose reduction .
RESULTS	This resulted in a @ % reduction in drug cost from before dose reduction ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Sixty-six percent of patients whose dosing was based on clinical features and @ % whose dosing was based on TC achieved remission , the primary end point ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Disease relapsed in @ patients who received clinically based dosing ( @ % ) and @ patients who received concentration-based dosing ( @ % ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Targeting patients ' infliximab TCs to @-@ g/mL results in a more efficient use of the drug .
CONCLUSIONS	After dose optimization , continued concentration-based dosing was not superior to clinically based dosing for achieving remission after @ year , but was associated with fewer flares during the course of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu number : @-@-@ .

RESULTS	The overall dose of intravenous morphine after @ h ( mean -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- ) was lower in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group ( @ -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- g/kg ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Continuous morphine infusion was less frequent in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group ( @ patient -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ patients -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Three patients in the Saline group had an episode of oxygen desaturation requiring oxygen therapy .
RESULTS	There were no technical failures or immediate complications of the SMB .
RESULTS	Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters , doses of sufentanil , pain scores , and postoperative hydroxyzine requirements were not different between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Bilateral SMB is an easy regional anesthesia technique that reduces total morphine consumption at @ h after cleft palate repair in children and the use of continuous infusion of morphine and may decrease postoperative respiratory complications .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AVP-@ , a drug-device combination of low-dose sumatriptan powder ( @mg loaded dose ) delivered intranasally through a targeted Breath Powered device vs an identical device containing lactose powder ( placebo device ) in the treatment of migraine headache .
BACKGROUND	Early treatment of migraine headaches is associated with improved outcome , but medication absorption after oral delivery may be delayed in migraineurs because of reduced gastric motility .
BACKGROUND	Sumatriptan powder administered with an innovative , closed-palate , Bi-Directional , Breath Powered intranasal delivery mechanism is efficiently absorbed across the nasal mucosa and produces fast absorption into the circulation .
BACKGROUND	Results from a previously conducted placebo-controlled study of AVP-@ showed a high degree of headache relief with an early onset of action ( eg , @ % AVP-@ vs @ % placebo device at @ hour , P < @ ) .
METHODS	In this double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura , participants were randomized via computer-generated lists to AVP-@ or placebo device to treat a single migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was headache relief ( defined as reduction of headache pain intensity from severe or moderate migraine headache to mild or none ) at @ hours post-dose .
RESULTS	Two hundred and thirty patients ( @ AVP-@ and @ placebo device ) were randomized , of whom @ ( @ and @ , respectively ) experienced a qualifying migraine headache ( their next migraine headache that reached moderate or severe intensity ) .
RESULTS	A significantly greater proportion of AVP-@ patients reported headache relief at @ hours post-dose compared with those using the placebo device ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ , odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Between-group differences in headache relief were evident as early as @ minutes , reached statistical significance at @ minutes post-dose ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , and were sustained at @ hours ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and @ hours ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Thirty-four percent of patients treated with AVP-@ were pain-free at @ hours compared with @ % using the placebo device ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	More AVP-@ patients reported meaningful pain relief ( patient interpretation ) of migraine within @ hours of treatment vs placebo device ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) , and fewer required rescue medication ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Total migraine freedom ( patients with no headache , nausea , phonophobia , photophobia , or vomiting ) reached significance following treatment with AVP-@ at @ hour ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events ( AEs ) , and no systemic AEs occurred in more than one patient .
RESULTS	Chest pain or pressure was not reported , and only one patient taking AVP-@ reported mild paresthesia .
RESULTS	No other triptan sensations were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Targeted delivery of a low-dose of sumatriptan powder via a novel , closed-palate , Breath Powered , intranasal device ( AVP-@ ) provided fast relief of moderate or severe migraine headache in adults that reached statistical significance over placebo by @ minutes .
CONCLUSIONS	The treatment was well tolerated with a low incidence of systemic AEs .

OBJECTIVE	To characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and pharmacodynamics ( PD ) of a new insulin glargine comprising @ units mL ( -@ ) ( Gla-@ ) , compared with insulin glargine @ units mL ( -@ ) ( Gla-@ ) at steady state in people with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , crossover study ( N = @ ) was conducted , applying the euglycemic clamp technique over a period of @ h.
METHODS	In this multiple-dose to steady-state study , participants received once-daily subcutaneous administrations of either @ ( cohort @ ) or @ units kg ( -@ ) ( cohort @ ) Gla-@ for @ days in one treatment period and @ units kg ( -@ ) Gla-@ for @ days in the other .
METHODS	Here we focus on the results of a direct comparison between @ units kg ( -@ ) of each treatment .
METHODS	PK and PD assessments performed on the last treatment day included serum insulin measurements using a radioimmunoassay and the automated euglycemic glucose clamp technique over @ h.
RESULTS	At steady state , insulin concentration ( INS ) and glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) profiles of Gla-@ were more constant and more evenly distributed over @ h compared with those of Gla-@ and lasted longer , as supported by the later time ( @ h ) to @ % of the area under the serum INS and GIR time curves from time zero to @ h post dosing .
RESULTS	Tight blood glucose control ( @ mg dL ( -@ ) ) was maintained for approximately @ h longer ( median of @ h ) with Gla-@ compared with Gla-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Gla-@ provides more even steady-state PK and PD profiles and a longer duration of action than Gla-@ , extending blood glucose control well beyond @ h.

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate intramuscular ketorolac compared with placebo saline injection for pain control with intrauterine device ( IUD ) placement .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial between July @ and March @ .
METHODS	Patients received @ mg ketorolac or placebo saline intramuscular injection @ minutes before IUD placement .
METHODS	The primary outcome was pain with IUD placement on a @-cm visual analog scale .
METHODS	Sample size was calculated to provide @ % power to show a @-cm difference ( = @ ) in the primary outcome .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included pain with study drug injection , speculum insertion , tenaculum placement , uterine sounding , and at @ and @ minutes after IUD placement .
RESULTS	A total of @ women participated in the study , @ in the ketorolac arm and @ in the placebo arm .
RESULTS	There were no differences in baseline demographics including age , body mass index , and race .
RESULTS	There were no differences in median pain scores for IUD placement in the placebo compared with ketorolac groups ( @ compared with @ cm , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a decrease in median pain scores at @ minutes ( @ compared with @ cm , P. @ ) and @ minutes ( @ compared with @ cm , P. @ ) after IUD placement but no difference for all other time points .
RESULTS	Nulliparous participants ( n = @ , eight per arm ) had a decrease in pain scores with IUD placement ( @ compared with @ cm , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In this study , @ % of participants in the placebo group and @ % in the ketorolac group reported injection pain was as painful as IUD placement .
CONCLUSIONS	Ketorolac does not reduce pain with IUD placement but does reduce pain at @ and @ minutes after placement .

OBJECTIVE	To study activin signaling and its blockade in sporadic inclusion body myositis ( sIBM ) through translational studies and a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	We measured transforming growth factor signaling by SMAD@/@ phosphorylation in muscle biopsies of @ patients with neuromuscular disease ( @ with sIBM ) .
METHODS	We tested inhibition of activin receptors IIA and IIB ( ActRII ) in @ patients with sIBM using one dose of bimagrumab ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the change in right thigh muscle volume by MRI at @ weeks .
METHODS	Lean body mass , strength , and function were secondary outcomes .
METHODS	Twelve of the patients ( @ bimagrumab , @ placebo ) participated in a subsequent @-week observation phase .
RESULTS	Muscle SMAD@/@ phosphorylation was higher in sIBM than in other muscle diseases studied ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Eight weeks after dosing , the bimagrumab-treated patients increased thigh muscle volume ( right leg +@ % compared with placebo , p = @ ; left leg +@ % , p = @ ) and lean body mass ( +@ % compared with placebo , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Subsequently , bimagrumab-treated patients had improved @-minute walking distance , which peaked at @ weeks ( +@ % , p = @ ) compared with placebo .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events ; the main adverse events with bimagrumab were mild acne and transient involuntary muscle contractions .
CONCLUSIONS	Transforming growth factor superfamily signaling , at least through ActRII , is implicated in the pathophysiology of sIBM .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of ActRII increased muscle mass and function in this pilot trial , offering a potential novel treatment of sIBM .
METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with inclusion body myositis , bimagrumab increases thigh muscle volume at @ weeks .

BACKGROUND	Although dental care settings provide an exceptional opportunity to reach smokers and provide brief cessation advice and treatment to reduce oral and other tobacco-related health conditions , dental care providers demonstrate limited adherence to evidence-based guidelines for treatment of tobacco use and dependence .
METHODS	Guided by a multi-level , conceptual framework that emphasizes changes in provider beliefs and organizational characteristics as drivers of improvement in tobacco treatment delivery , the current protocol will use a cluster , randomized design and multiple data sources ( patient exit interviews , provider surveys , site observations , chart audits , and semi-structured provider interviews ) to study the process of implementing clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco dependence in @ public dental care clinics in New York City .
METHODS	The specific aims of this comparative-effectiveness research trial are to : compare the effectiveness of three promising strategies for implementation of tobacco use treatment guidelines-staff training and current best practices ( CBP ) , CBP + provider performance feedback ( PF ) , and CBP+PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment ( pay-for-performance , or P@P ) ; examine potential theory-driven mechanisms hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation ; and identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics .
METHODS	The primary outcome is change in providers ' tobacco treatment practices and the secondary outcomes are cost per quit , use of tobacco cessation treatments , quit attempts , and smoking abstinence .
CONCLUSIONS	We hypothesize that the value of these promising implementation strategies is additive and that incorporating all three strategies ( CBP , PF , and P@P ) will be superior to CBP alone and CBP+PF in improving delivery of cessation assistance to smokers .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings will improve knowledge pertinent to the implementation , dissemination , and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment in dental practices .

METHODS	Multicenter , randomized , controlled trial on preoperative pain neuroscience education ( NE ) for lumbar radiculopathy .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if the addition of NE to usual preoperative education would result in superior outcomes with regard to pain , function , surgical experience , and health care utilization postsurgery .
BACKGROUND	One in @ patients after lumbar surgery ( LS ) for radiculopathy experience persistent pain and disability , which is nonresponsive to perioperative treatments .
BACKGROUND	NE focusing on the neurophysiology of pain has been shown to decrease pain and disability in populations with chronic low back pain .
METHODS	Eligible patients scheduled for LS for radiculopathy were randomized to receive either preoperative usual care ( UC ) or a combination of UC plus @ session of NE delivered by a physical therapist ( verbal one-on-one format ) and a NE booklet .
METHODS	Sixty-seven patients completed the following outcomes prior to LS ( baseline ) , and @ , @ , @ , and @ months after LS : low back pain ( numeric rating scale ) , leg pain ( numeric rating scale ) , function ( Oswestry Disability Index ) , various beliefs and experiences related to LS ( @-item survey with Likert scale responses ) , and postoperative utilization of health care ( utilization of health care questionnaire ) .
RESULTS	At @-year follow-up , there were no statistical differences between the experimental and control groups with regard to primary outcome measure of low back pain ( P = @ ) , leg pain ( P = @ ) , and function ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In a majority of the categories regarding surgical experience , the NE group scored significantly better : better prepared for LS ( P = @ ) ; preoperative session preparing them for LS ( P < @ ) and LS meeting their expectations ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Health care utilization post-LS also favored the NE group ( P = @ ) resulting in @ % less health care expenditure compared with the control group in the @-year follow-up period .
CONCLUSIONS	NE resulted in significant behavior change .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite a similar pain and functional trajectory during the @-year trial , patients with LS who received NE viewed their surgical experience more favorably and used less health care facility in the form of medical tests and treatments .

OBJECTIVE	To compare extra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision at cesarean delivery with in situ repair .
METHODS	The present study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted at a university hospital in Egypt during @-@ , and included women with an indication for cesarean delivery .
METHODS	Extra-abdominal repair was used in group @ ( n = @ ) and in situ repair in group @ ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the surgery duration .
RESULTS	Surgery duration was significantly longer in group @ than group @ ( @ minutes vs @ minutes ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	More patients in group @ than in group @ had postoperative moderate-to-severe pain ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) and needed additional postoperative analgesia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , mean time to bowel movement was longer in group @ than in group @ ( @ hours vs @ hours ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In situ uterine closure is more advantageous than extra-abdominal repair in terms of surgery duration , postoperative pain and need for additional analgesia , and return of bowel movement .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT@ .

###24685085
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) combined with graduated compression stockings ( GCS ) with GCS alone as prophylactic measures for venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) in post-operative patients with gynecologic cancer .
METHODS	Patients diagnosed with gynecologic cancer undergoing primary major surgery between @ and @ in our institute were randomized to receive LMWH+GCS or GCS as VTE prophylaxis post-operatively .
RESULTS	Altogether @ patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	The incidence of VTE in patients treated with LMWH + GCS was significantly lower than that in patients using GCS alone ( @ % Vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no severe bleeding complications in the patients with prophylactic use of LMWH and the occurrence rate of wound dehiscence was comparable between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age over @ years ( P = @ ) , duration of operation over @ hours ( P = @ ) and without prophylactic use of LMWH ( P = @ ) were independent risk factors for VTE .
CONCLUSIONS	Dual prophylaxis with LMWH and GCS should be recommended for gynecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery for its better efficacy than GCS .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic use of LMWH is safe and convenient .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with older age and prolonged operation time are at highest risk of developing VTE post-operatively .

BACKGROUND	Oral ulcers , the hallmark of Behet 's syndrome , can be resistant to conventional treatment ; therefore , alternative agents are needed .
BACKGROUND	Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-@ inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory pathways .
METHODS	We conducted a phase @ , multicenter , placebo-controlled study in which @ patients with Behet 's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive @ mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	This regimen was followed by a @-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a @-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase .
METHODS	The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial .
METHODS	The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week @ .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers ( measured on a @-mm visual-analogue scale , with higher scores indicating worse pain ) , the number of genital ulcers , overall disease activity , and quality of life .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) number of oral ulcers per patient at week @ was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group ( @ vs. @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean decline in pain from oral ulcers from baseline to week @ was greater with apremilast than with placebo ( -@ mm vs. -@ mm ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were more common in the apremilast group ( with @ , @ , and @ incidents , respectively , among @ patients ) than in the placebo group ( with @ , @ , and @ incidents , respectively , among @ patients ) , findings that were similar to those in previous studies of apremilast .
RESULTS	There were two serious adverse events in patients receiving apremilast .
CONCLUSIONS	Apremilast was effective in treating oral ulcers , which are the cardinal manifestation of Behet 's syndrome .
CONCLUSIONS	This preliminary study was neither large enough nor long enough to assess long-term efficacy , the effect on other manifestations of Behet 's syndrome , or the risk of uncommon serious adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by Celgene ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

OBJECTIVE	Leg compression is considered basic treatment for superficial vein thrombosis ( SVT ) , although scientific proof for its efficacy is lacking .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of compression stockings on isolated SVT of the legs .
METHODS	This was a single-center randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Eighty patients with isolated SVT of the legs were instructed to wear compression stockings ( @-@mmHg ) ( CG ) or no compression ( NCG ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	All patients received low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) at prophylactic dosage .
METHODS	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) were allowed .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was the reduction of pain as assessed by a visual analog scale ( VAS ) and the Lowenberg test .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were the consumption of analgesics , thrombus length , skin erythema , D-dimer , and quality of life ( QoL ) .
RESULTS	Seventy-three patients completed the study .
RESULTS	Clinical symptoms and QoL significantly improved from baseline to day @ in both groups ( p < @ for VAS , Lowenberg test , thrombus length , and erythema ; p < @ for QoL ) , and consumption of analgesics and D-dimer significantly decreased ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the groups for all tested variables .
RESULTS	At day @ , patients in the CG revealed a significantly faster thrombus regression ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding compression stockings for @ weeks to LMWH and NSAIDs does not bring significant additional benefit in the treatment of isolated SVT .
CONCLUSIONS	When worn for @ week , compression stockings stimulate significantly faster thrombus regression .

###24766353
OBJECTIVE	Two reports of infants found dead after sleeping in baby hammocks have raised international concern about the safety of infant hammocks .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore tested whether hammock sleep affected oxygenation in infants , when they were at an age of high risk of sudden , unexpected infant death .
METHODS	Healthy , full-term @ - to @-week-old infants were randomised to sleep either in a commercially available hammock ( n = @ ) or a standard bassinet ( n = @ ) , and sleep state , oxygen desaturation ( a fall in peripheral haemoglobin oxygen saturation ( SpO@ ) @ % , for @ sec from baseline to nadir ) , apnoea and hypopnoea , and mean SpO@ were analysed .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in mean SpO@ ( both @ % ) or rate of oxygen desaturation events between the hammock and the bassinet cot ( mean SD , @ @ vs. @ @ events per hour ) , but infants slept less in the hammock ( @ @ vs. @ @ min , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When correctly used , the hammock sleep position did not compromise the upper airway of sleeping infants .
CONCLUSIONS	The significance of shorter duration of sleep in the hammocks is unclear .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings should not be applied to all baby hammocks , nor to older babies , particularly once the infant can roll .
CONCLUSIONS	Given that it is not possible to predict when an infant will be able to roll , we strongly recommend that hammocks should not be used for unsupervised sleep .

OBJECTIVE	We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of intra-articular calcaneus fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation with conventional plate via L-shaped lateral approach ( routine treatment ) versus those with percutaneous plate via a sinus tarsi approach ( minimally invasive treatment ) .
METHODS	One hundred and seventeen displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in @ patients from January @ and September @ were randomly allocated to receive routine treatment ( @ patients ) or minimally invasive treatment ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	Operative time , preoperative and postoperative calcaneal height , width , length , Bhlers angle , Gissanes angle , and incision healing were recorded .
METHODS	Maryland foot score system was used to evaluate clinical functional outcomes .
RESULTS	The operative time of minimally invasive group was significantly shorter than that of the routine group -LSB- @-@ min ( mean , @ min ) vs @-@ min ( mean , @ min ) , p < @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Postoperative X-ray showed the calcaneal height , width , length , Bhlers angle and Gissanes angle were significantly improved in both two groups , and no significant difference was observed between two groups postoperatively .
RESULTS	No feet developed wound complications in minimally invasive group , but incision complications occurred in @ feet in routine group .
RESULTS	The excellent and good rate according to the Maryland foot score was significantly higher in minimally invasive group than that in the routine group ( @ % vs @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with L-shaped lateral approach treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures , sinus tarsi approach for the reduction and internal fixation with percutaneous plate seems to be more safe and effective , with satisfactory clinical therapeutic effects and without postoperative complications .

BACKGROUND	The incidence of acute kidney injury ( AKI ) is estimated at @ to @ % in patients admitted to intensive care units ( ICU ) and often requires renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) .
BACKGROUND	ICU mortality in AKI patients can exceed @ % .
BACKGROUND	Venous catheters are the preferred vascular access method for AKI patients requiring RRT , but carry a risk of catheter thrombosis or infection .
BACKGROUND	Catheter lock solutions are commonly used to prevent such complications .
BACKGROUND	Heparin and citrate locks are both widely used for tunneled , long-term catheters , but few studies have compared citrate versus heparin for patients with short-term , non-tunneled catheters .
BACKGROUND	We aim to compare citrate @ % catheter lock solution versus heparin in terms of event-free survival of the first non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter inserted in ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT .
BACKGROUND	Secondary objectives are the rate of fibrinolysis , incidence of catheter thrombosis and catheter-related infection per @,@ catheter days , length of stay in ICU and in-hospital and @-day mortality .
METHODS	The VERROU-REA study is a randomized , prospective , multicenter , double-blind , parallel-group , controlled superiority study carried out in the medical , surgical and nephrological ICUs of two large university hospitals in eastern France .
METHODS	A catheter lock solution composed of trisodium citrate at @ % will be compared to unfractionated heparin at a concentration of @,@ IU/mL .
METHODS	All consecutive adult patients with AKI requiring extracorporeal RRT , and in whom a first non-tunneled catheter is to be inserted by the jugular or femoral approach , will be eligible .
METHODS	Catheters inserted by the subclavian approach , patients with acute liver failure , thrombopenia or contraindication to systemic anticoagulation will be excluded .
METHODS	Patients will be followed up daily in accordance with standard practices for RRT until death or discharge .
CONCLUSIONS	Data is scarce regarding the use of non-tunneled catheters in the ICU setting in patients with AKI .
CONCLUSIONS	This study will provide an evidence base for recommendations regarding the use of anticoagulant catheter locks for the prevention of dysfunction in non-tunneled hemodialysis catheters in patients with AKI in critical or intensive care .

BACKGROUND	Paradoxically , a breast cancer risk reduction with conjugated equine estrogens ( CEE ) and a risk elevation with CEE plus medroxyprogesterone acetate ( CEE+MPA ) were observed in the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) randomized controlled trials .
BACKGROUND	The effects of hormone therapy on serum sex hormone levels , and on the association between baseline sex hormones and disease risk , may help explain these divergent breast cancer findings .
METHODS	Serum sex hormone concentrations were measured for @ breast cancer cases in the CEE+MPA trial and for @ cases in the CEE trial along with corresponding pair-matched controls , nested within the WHI trials of healthy postmenopausal women .
METHODS	Association and mediation analyses , to examine the extent to which sex hormone levels and changes can explain the breast cancer findings , were conducted using logistic regression .
RESULTS	Following CEE treatment , breast cancer risk was associated with higher concentrations of baseline serum estrogens , and with lower concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin .
RESULTS	However , following CEE+MPA , there was no association of breast cancer risk with baseline sex hormone levels .
RESULTS	The sex hormone changes from baseline to year @ provided an explanation for much of the reduced breast cancer risk with CEE .
RESULTS	Specifically , the treatment odds ratio ( @ % confidence interval ) increased from @ ( @ , @ ) to @ ( @ , @ ) when the year @ measures were included in the logistic regression analysis .
RESULTS	In comparison , the CEE+MPA odds ratio was essentially unchanged when these year @ measures were included .
CONCLUSIONS	Breast cancer risk remains low following CEE use among women having favorable baseline sex hormone profiles , but CEE+MPA evidently produces a breast cancer risk for all women similar to that for women having an unfavorable baseline sex hormone profile .
CONCLUSIONS	These patterns could reflect breast ductal epithelial cell stimulation by CEE+MPA that is substantially avoided with CEE , in conjunction with relatively more favorable effects of either regimen following a sustained period of estrogen deprivation .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may have implications for other hormone therapy formulations and routes of delivery .

BACKGROUND	The role of three factors in drinking outcome after brief intervention among heavily drinking HIV patients were investigated : strength of commitment to change drinking , alcohol dependence , and treatment type : brief Motivational Interview ( MI ) only , or MI plus HealthCall , a technological extension of brief intervention .
METHODS	HIV primary care patients ( N = @ ) who drank @ drinks at least once in the @ days before study entry participated in MI-only or MI+H ealthCall in a randomized trial to reduce drinking .
METHODS	Patients were @ % minority ; @ % female ; @ % alcohol dependent ; mean age @ .
METHODS	Outcome at end of treatment ( @ days ) was drinks per drinking day ( Timeline Follow-Back ) .
METHODS	Commitment strength ( CS ) was rated from MI session recordings .
RESULTS	Overall , stronger CS predicted end-of-treatment drinking ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	After finding an interaction of treatment , CS and alcohol dependence ( p = @ ) , we examined treatmentCS interactions in alcohol dependent and non-dependent patients .
RESULTS	In alcohol dependent patients , the treatmentcommitment strength interaction was significant ( p = @ ) ; patients with low commitment strength had better outcomes in MI+H ealthCall than in MI-only ( lower mean drinks per drinking day ; @ and @ drinks , respectively ) .
RESULTS	In non-dependent patients , neither treatment nor CS predicted outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Among alcohol dependent HIV patients , HealthCall was most beneficial in drinking reduction when MI ended with low commitment strength .
CONCLUSIONS	HealthCall may not merely extend MI effects , but add effects of its own that compensate for low commitment strength .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , HealthCall may also be effective when paired with briefer interventions requiring less skill , training and supervision than MI .
CONCLUSIONS	Replication is warranted .

BACKGROUND	Esophageal resection is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pneumonia .
BACKGROUND	Respiratory complications account for almost half of the readmissions to the critical care unit .
BACKGROUND	Postoperative complications can result in prolonged hospital stay and consequently increase healthcare costs .
BACKGROUND	In cardiac surgery a preoperative inspiratory muscle training program has shown to prevent postoperative pneumonia and reduce length of hospital stay .
BACKGROUND	While in some surgical centers inspiratory muscle training is already used in the preoperative phase in patients undergoing esophageal resection , the added value of this intervention on the reduction of pulmonary complications has not yet been investigated in large surgical populations other than cardiac surgery in a randomized and controlled study design .
METHODS	The effect of a preoperative inspiratory muscle training program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal resection will be studied in a single blind multicenter randomized controlled trial ( the PREPARE study ) .
METHODS	In total @ patients ( age > @years ) undergoing esophageal resection for esophageal cancer will be included in this study .
METHODS	They are randomized to either usual care or usual care with an additional inspiratory muscle training intervention according to a high-intensity protocol which is performed with a tapered flow resistive inspiratory loading device .
METHODS	Patients have to complete @ dynamic inspiratory efforts twice daily for @days a week until surgery with a minimum of @weeks .
METHODS	The starting training load will be aimed to be @ % of maximal inspiratory pressure and will be increased based on the rate of perceived exertion.The main study endpoint is the incidence of postoperative pneumonia .
METHODS	Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of preoperative inspiratory muscle training on length of hospital stay , duration of mechanical ventilation , incidence of other postoperative ( pulmonary ) complications , quality of life , and on postoperative respiratory muscle function and lung function .
CONCLUSIONS	The PREPARE study is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that preoperative inspiratory muscle training leads to decreased pulmonary complications in patients undergoing esophageal resection .

OBJECTIVE	Few data are available on the influence of a colonoscope length for trainees , which could affect both the duration of training and colonoscopy quality .
OBJECTIVE	We conducted this study to validate which scope needs more duration for training to reach technical competence and to shows better quality indicators during diagnostic colonoscopy .
METHODS	We conducted a prospective randomly assigned study from April @ to February @ at Asan Medical Center .
METHODS	Among the @ patients enrolled , @ colonoscopies were analyzed .
METHODS	We compared cecal intubation rate , adenoma detection rate , cecal intubation time ( < @ min ) , and withdrawal time between the trainees using the intermediate-length colonoscope and those using long-length colonoscope .
RESULTS	Trainees who used the long-length colonoscope showed a higher overall cecal intubation rate ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) and adenoma detection rate ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) than those using the intermediate-length colonoscope .
RESULTS	The successful cecal intubation rate improved significantly and reached the requisite standard of competence ( > @ % ) after @ procedures in the long-length colonoscope group .
RESULTS	However , the trainees using the intermediate-length colonoscope reached the requisite standard of competence after @ procedures .
RESULTS	Logistic regression analysis revealed that prolonged cecal intubation was associated with the use of the intermediate-length colonoscope , poor colon preparation , a small number of esophagastroduodenoscopy or sigmoidoscopy procedures conducted , and pain during procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	During the same training period , use of the long-length colonoscope in trainee was better in terms of reaching competency and quality indicators , and was less painful for the patients during colonoscopic procedures .

OBJECTIVE	Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) is an emerging technique for the in vivo assessment of functional activity of the cerebral cortex as well as in the field of brain-computer interface ( BCI ) research .
OBJECTIVE	A common challenge for the utilization of fNIRS in these areas is a stable and reliable investigation of the spatio-temporal hemodynamic patterns .
OBJECTIVE	However , the recorded patterns may be influenced and superimposed by signals generated from physiological processes , resulting in an inaccurate estimation of the cortical activity .
OBJECTIVE	Up to now only a few studies have investigated these influences , and still less has been attempted to remove/reduce these influences .
OBJECTIVE	The present study aims to gain insights into the reduction of physiological rhythms in hemodynamic signals ( oxygenated hemoglobin ( oxy-Hb ) , deoxygenated hemoglobin ( deoxy-Hb ) ) .
METHODS	We introduce the use of three different signal processing approaches ( spatial filtering , a common average reference ( CAR ) method ; independent component analysis ( ICA ) ; and transfer function ( TF ) models ) to reduce the influence of respiratory and blood pressure ( BP ) rhythms on the hemodynamic responses .
RESULTS	All approaches produce large reductions in BP and respiration influences on the oxy-Hb signals and , therefore , improve the contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , for deoxy-Hb signals CAR and ICA did not improve the CNR .
RESULTS	However , for the TF approach , a CNR-improvement in deoxy-Hb can also be found .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study investigates the application of different signal processing approaches to reduce the influences of physiological rhythms on the hemodynamic responses .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition to the identification of the best signal processing method , we also show the importance of noise reduction in fNIRS data .

BACKGROUND	Korean red ginseng ( KRG ) is a processed ginseng from raw ginseng to enhance safety , preservation and efficacy , known having beneficial effects on women 's health due to its estrogen like function .
BACKGROUND	While estrogen supplementation showed some modulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals , bisphenol A ( BPA ) has been focused as a potential endocrine disrupting chemical .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we examined the efficacy and safety outcomes of KRG against BPA , focusing on female quality of life ( QOL ) .
BACKGROUND	Individual variations in susceptibility to KRG were also investigated with the Sasang Typology , the personalized medicine used for hundred years in Korea .
METHODS	We performed a single-blind randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Study subjects were young women ( N = @ ) , consumed @ g of KRG or placebo per day for @ weeks and filled up questionnaires regarding gynecologic complaints at the @ time spots .
METHODS	We analyzed urinary total BPA and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , an oxidative stress biomarker , with GC/MS and HPLC/UVD respectively , and diagnosed their Sasang Typology with the questionnaire for the Sasang constitution Classification ( QSCC II ) .
RESULTS	KRG consumption decreased urinary BPA and MDA levels ( ps < @ ) and alleviated ` menstrual irregularity ' , ` menstrual pain ' , and ` constipation ' ( ps < @ ) .
RESULTS	SoEum type ( Lesser Yin person ) among the Sasang types showed significant alleviation in insomnia , flushing , perspiration and appetite by KRG consumption , rather than other Sasang types .
RESULTS	During the intervention , no one experienced any aggravated side effects .
CONCLUSIONS	We suggest KRG is efficient for protection for female QOL and BPA - exposure and - related oxidative stress .
CONCLUSIONS	However , individual variation in susceptibility to KRG should be further considered for identifying ideal therapy .

OBJECTIVE	Conventional total uncinectomy may be unnecessary in localized maxillary sinus lesion .
OBJECTIVE	Partial removal of the uncinate process and middle meatal antrostomy would be sufficient to eradicate the pathological condition .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of partial uncinectomy versus total removal of the uncinate process in patients with localized maxillary sinus disease .
METHODS	In total , @ patients were assigned randomly to partial and total uncinectomy groups .
METHODS	Preoperative computed tomography established that all patients had localized pathology in the maxillary sinus .
METHODS	The lower half of the uncinate process was removed in the partial uncinectomy group , while the total uncinectomy group underwent the conventional surgery .
METHODS	Time required for the uncinectomy , healing period for the uncinectomy site , incidence of lamina papyracea or nasolacrimal duct injury , obstruction or stenosis of the frontal recess , and incidence of synechia formation in the middle meatus were compared between the groups .
RESULTS	All patients completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis .
RESULTS	Surgical indications included chronic maxillary sinusitis , fungal sinusitis , antrochoanal polyp , and odontogenic sinusitis .
RESULTS	Operation durations and healing periods were significantly shorter in the partial uncinectomy group .
RESULTS	One patient had a minor injury to the lamina papyracea and two patients showed partial synechia formations in the total uncinectomy group .
RESULTS	However , other parameters did not differ significantly between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Partial uncinectomy may be useful in patients with pathological conditions confined to the maxillary sinus .
CONCLUSIONS	Shorter operation duration , more rapid healing , and lower incidence of complications are advantages over a conventional total uncinectomy .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the performance and safety of SGF in subjects with CVU .
METHODS	Open , randomized , standard-of-care-controlled , multi-centre trial .
METHODS	Subjects ( ITT @ patients ) received either SGF in addition to standard treatment or standard-of-care treatment ( S-o-C ) alone .
METHODS	The primary performance variable was the time to healing of the target ulcer until the end of a @ week treatment period .
RESULTS	SGF was well tolerated .
RESULTS	Mean time to healing up to week @ was @ days for the SGF group ( SE @ ) and @ days for the S-o-C group ( SE @ ) ( p-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically relevant difference regarding the incidence of complete healing of the target ulcers by weeks @ and @ between the SGF and the S-o-C groups ( p-value > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	SGF is well tolerated and offers a promising perspective as a carrier substrate for the local release of active pharmaceutical agents into the wound site to promote tissue repair .

METHODS	Genistein from foods or supplements is metabolized by the gut microbiota and the human body , thereby releasing many different metabolites into systemic circulation .
METHODS	The order of their appearance in plasma and the possible influence of food format are still unknown .
METHODS	This study compared the nutrikinetic profiles of genistein metabolites .
RESULTS	In a randomized cross-over trial , @ healthy young volunteers were administered a single dose of @ mg genistein provided as a genistein tablet , a genistein tablet in low fat milk , and soy milk containing genistein glycosides .
RESULTS	A high mass resolution LC-LTQ-Orbitrap FTMS platform detected and quantified in human plasma : free genistein , seven of its phase-II metabolites and @ gut-derived metabolites .
RESULTS	Interestingly , a novel metabolite , genistein-@ ' - glucuronide-@-sulfate ( G-@ ` G-@S ) was identified .
RESULTS	Nutrikinetic analysis using population-based modeling revealed the order of appearance of five genistein phase II metabolites in plasma : ( @ ) genistein-@ ' ,@ - diglucuronide , ( @ ) genistein-@-sulfate , ( @ ) genistein-@ ' - sulfate-@-glucuronide , ( @ ) genistein-@ ' - glucuronide , and ( @ ) genistein-@-glucuronide , independent of the food matrix .
CONCLUSIONS	The conjugated genistein metabolites appear in a distinct order in human plasma .
CONCLUSIONS	The specific early appearance of G-@ ' ,@ - diG suggests a multistep formation process for the mono and hetero genistein conjugates , involving one or two deglucuronidation steps .

BACKGROUND	Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT ) disease type @A is the most common form of CMT .
BACKGROUND	The main clinical features are distal weakness , sensory loss , and skeletal deformities .
BACKGROUND	Although pain is a frequent complaint , small fiber involvement in CMT@A has not been studied extensively .
METHODS	We assessed pain and small fiber involvement in @ CMT@A patients using a variety of pain scales , pain questionnaires , and thermal thresholds .
RESULTS	Forty-three of @ patients ( @ % ) complained of pain .
RESULTS	The pain was localized to the feet in @ % of patients .
RESULTS	Only @ % of patients had neuropathic pain .
RESULTS	Cold and warm detection thresholds were elevated in @ % and @ % of patients , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings confirm that CMT@A patients have significant pain , which is more likely to be multifactorial in origin and suggests that a proportion of patients have small fiber dysfunction affecting mainly thinly myelinated A fibers .

OBJECTIVE	The comparative incidences of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis associated with contemporary ultrasound-guided supraclavicular versus infraclavicular blockade have not received extensive study .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that the infraclavicular approach results in a lower incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis compared with supraclavicular blockade when a standard local anesthetic volume and concentration are used .
METHODS	With institutional human ethics board approval , we enrolled @ patients undergoing right-sided upper extremity surgery in a randomized , blinded , parallel-group trial .
METHODS	Patients were assigned to ultrasound-guided supraclavicular or infraclavicular blockade with @ mL of @ % ropivacaine .
METHODS	The primary end point was complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis at @ minutes , defined as a greater than @ % reduction in diaphragmatic excursion measured with the voluntary sniff test using M-mode ultrasonography .
METHODS	Partial paralysis was defined as a @ % to @ % reduction .
RESULTS	Eleven ( @ % ) of @ patients in the supraclavicular group versus @ ( @ % ) of @ in the infraclavicular group had complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis ( P = @ -LSB- @-tailed -RSB- ; relative risk , @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ) ; @ % versus @ % had any ( complete or partial ) paralysis ( P = @ ; relative risk , @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Eight ( @ % ) of @ patients in the supraclavicular group versus @ ( @ % ) of @ in the infraclavicular group reported dyspnea ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blockade with @ mL of @ % ropivacaine produced complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis in approximately one-third of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The infraclavicular approach greatly reduced this risk but did not eliminate it .
CONCLUSIONS	These data may aid in the selection of the approach to brachial plexus blockade , particularly in ambulatory patients and/or those with respiratory comorbidities .

BACKGROUND	Leucine is a key amino acid involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed the effect of the supplementation of a lower-protein mixed macronutrient beverage with varying doses of leucine or a mixture of branched chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) on myofibrillar protein synthesis ( MPS ) at rest and after exercise .
METHODS	In a parallel group design , @ men ( @ @ y ) completed unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise before the ingestion of @ g whey protein ( W@ ) ( @ g leucine ) , @ g whey protein ( W@ ) ( @ g leucine ) , @ g whey protein supplemented with leucine to @ g total leucine ( W@ + Low-Leu ) , @ g whey protein supplemented with leucine to @ g total leucine ( W@ + High-Leu ) , or @ g whey protein supplemented with leucine , isoleucine , and valine to @ g total leucine .
METHODS	A primed continuous infusion of l - -LSB- ring - ( @ ) C@ -RSB- phenylalanine with serial muscle biopsies was used to measure MPS under baseline fasted and postprandial conditions in both a rested ( response to feeding ) and exercised ( response to combined feeding and resistance exercise ) leg .
RESULTS	The area under the blood leucine curve was greatest for the W@ + High-Leu group compared with the W@ and W@ + Low-Leu groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the postprandial period , rates of MPS were increased above baseline over @-@ @ h in all treatments .
RESULTS	Over @-@ @ h , MPS remained increased above baseline after all treatments but was greatest after W@ ( @ % ) and W@ + High-Leu ( @ % ) treatments ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A low-protein ( @ g ) mixed macronutrient beverage can be as effective as a high-protein dose ( @ g ) at stimulating increased MPS rates when supplemented with a high ( @ g total leucine ) amount of leucine .
CONCLUSIONS	These results have important implications for formulations of protein beverages designed to enhance muscle anabolism .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT @ .

BACKGROUND	People with prediabetes are at increased risk for developing type @ diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	Weight reduction through lifestyle modification can significantly reduce diabetes risk .
BACKGROUND	Yet , weight loss varies among individuals and some people do not achieve clinically meaningful weight loss after treatment .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate the time point and threshold for achieving @ % weight loss after completion of a @-week worksite , lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention .
METHODS	Weight change before and after the behavioral intervention among participants randomized to the experimental group was examined .
METHODS	Individuals with prediabetes aged @ to @ years with a body mass index ( calculated as kg/m ( @ ) ) of @ to @ at Ohio State University were eligible .
METHODS	The @-week , group-based intervention , adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program , was delivered to @ participants in the experimental group .
METHODS	Percent weight loss was assessed weekly during the intervention and at @ - and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Linear regression modeled the relationship between percent weight loss during month @ of the intervention and percent weight loss at @ and @ months .
METHODS	Logistic regression modeled failure to lose @ % weight loss at @ and @ months using weekly weight change during the first month of intervention .
RESULTS	Percent weight loss at intervention week @ was significantly associated with percent weight loss at @ and @ months ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Only @ % and @ % of participants who failed to achieve a @ % weight-loss threshold during month @ achieved @ % weight loss at months @ and @ , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	The first month of lifestyle treatment is a critical period for helping participants achieve weight loss .
CONCLUSIONS	Otherwise , individuals who fail to achieve at least @ % weight loss may benefit from more intensive rescue efforts or stepped-care interventions .

OBJECTIVE	Mealtime insulin is commonly added to manage hyperglycemia in type @ diabetes when basal insulin is insufficient .
OBJECTIVE	However , this complex regimen is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia .
OBJECTIVE	This study compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide twice daily or mealtime insulin lispro in patients inadequately controlled by insulin glargine and metformin despite up-titration .
METHODS	In this @-week , open-label , multicenter , randomized , noninferiority trial with @ weeks prior insulin optimization , @ patients with insufficient postoptimization glycated hemoglobin A@c ( HbA@c ) were randomized to exenatide ( @-@ g/day ) or thrice-daily mealtime lispro titrated to premeal glucose of @-@ @ mmol/L , both added to insulin glargine ( mean @ units/day at randomization ) and metformin ( mean @,@ mg/day ) .
RESULTS	Randomization HbA@c and fasting glucose ( FG ) were @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) and @ mmol/L for exenatide and @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) and @ mmol/L for lispro .
RESULTS	At @ weeks postrandomization , mean HbA@c changes were noninferior for exenatide compared with lispro ( -@ and -@ % , respectively ) ; treatment differences were -@ ( @ % CI -@ , @ ) in per-protocol ( n = @ ) and -@ ( @ % CI -@ , @ ) in intent-to-treat ( n = @ ) populations .
RESULTS	FG was lower with exenatide than lispro ( @ vs. @ mmol/L ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Weight decreased with exenatide and increased with lispro ( -@ vs. +@ kg ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	More patients reported treatment satisfaction and better quality of life with exenatide than lispro , although a larger proportion of patients with exenatide experienced treatment-emergent adverse events .
RESULTS	Exenatide resulted in fewer nonnocturnal hypoglycemic episodes but more gastrointestinal adverse events than lispro .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding exenatide to titrated glargine with metformin resulted in similar glycemic control as adding lispro and was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support exenatide as a noninsulin addition for patients failing basal insulin .

OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effect of the MD-Logic system on overnight glycemic control at patients ' homes .
METHODS	Twenty-four patients ( aged @-@ years ; average A@c @ @ % , @ @ mmol/mol ) were randomly assigned to participate in two overnight crossover periods , each including @ weeks of consecutive nights : one under closed loop and the second under sensor-augmented pump ( SAP ) therapy at patients ' homes in real-life conditions .
METHODS	The primary end point was time spent with sensor glucose levels below @ mg/dL ( @ mmol/L ) overnight .
RESULTS	Closed-loop nights significantly reduced time spent in hypoglycemia ( P = @ ) and increased the percentage of time spent in the target range of @-@ mg/dL ( P = @ ) compared with nights when the SAP therapy was used .
RESULTS	The time spent in substantial hyperglycemia above @ mg/dL was reduced by a median of @ % ( interquartile range -LSB- IQR -RSB- @ , @ % ; P = @ ) under closed-loop control compared with SAP therapy .
RESULTS	Overnight total insulin doses were lower in the closed-loop nights compared with the SAP nights ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The average daytime glucose levels after closed-loop operation were reduced by a median of @ mg/dL ( IQR -@ , @ ; P = @ ) while lower total insulin doses were used ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No severe adverse events occurred during closed-loop control ; there was a single event of severe hypoglycemia during a control night .
CONCLUSIONS	The long-term home use of automated overnight insulin delivery by the MD-Logic system was found to be a feasible , safe , and an effective tool to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia and improve overnight glycemic control in subjects with type @ diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to describe pretreatment patient characteristics and baseline quality-of-life scores as they relate to the development of grade @ or @ toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent cervical cancer .
METHODS	The study sample was drawn from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols @ and @ .
METHODS	Grade @ or @ toxicities were considered in @ specified categories as follows : peripheral neuropathy , fatigue , hematological , and gastrointestinal ( GI ) .
METHODS	The data variables explored included age , stage , pretreatment radiation , performance status ( PS ) at treatment initiation , and baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix ( FACT-Cx ) score .
METHODS	A logistic regression model was developed with various adverse events as binary ( @/@ ) outcomes .
RESULTS	Six hundred seventy-three patient-reported questionnaires were used in the analyses .
RESULTS	At baseline , pain was the most severe patient-reported symptom .
RESULTS	Baseline line-item patient concerns did demonstrate specific correlations with the development of individual toxicities .
RESULTS	In @ patients who were enrolled on Gynecologic Oncology Group @ ( fatigue not measured on @ ) , a worse PS predicted the development of grade @ or @ fatigue ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Exposure to previous radiation , treatment regimen , and a worse FACT-Cx score were associated with the reporting of both grade @ or @ leukopenia ( P < @ ) and anemia ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Performance status and treatment regimen ( P < @ ) were associated with the development of grade @ or @ thrombocytopenia .
RESULTS	Age and treatment regimen ( P < @ ) were associated with the development of grade @ or @ neutropenia .
RESULTS	The FACT-Cx score ( P = @ ) predicted grade @ or @ GI toxicity .
CONCLUSIONS	The development of fatigue , hematological , and GI toxicity might be predictable based on factors other than treatment assignment such as age , PS , and patient-reported quality-of-life measurement .

BACKGROUND	The ongoing scale-up of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in sub-Saharan Africa has prompted the interest in surveillance of transmitted and acquired HIV drug resistance .
BACKGROUND	Resistance data on virological failure and mutations in HIV infected populations initiating treatment in sub-Saharan Africa is sparse .
METHODS	HIV viral load ( VL ) and resistance mutations pre-ART and after @ months were determined in a prospective cohort study of ART-nave HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Jimma , Ethiopia .
METHODS	VL measurements were done at baseline and after @ and @ months .
METHODS	Genotypic HIV drug resistance ( HIVDR ) was performed on patients exhibiting virological failure ( > @ copies/mL at @ months ) or slow virological response ( > @ copies/mL at @ months and < @ copies/mL at @ months ) .
RESULTS	Two hundred sixty five patients had VL data available at baseline and at @ months .
RESULTS	Virological failure was observed among @ ( @ % ) participants out of @ patients .
RESULTS	Twelve samples were genotyped and six had HIV drug resistance ( HIVDR ) mutations at baseline .
RESULTS	Among virological failures , @/@ ( @ % ) harbored one or more HIVDR mutations at @ months .
RESULTS	The most frequent mutations were K@N and M@VI .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data confirm that the currently recommended first-line ART regimen is efficient in the vast majority of individuals initiating therapy in Jimma , Ethiopia eight years after the introduction of ART .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the documented occurrence of transmitted resistance and accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations among failing patients justify increased vigilance by improving the availability and systematic use of VL testing to monitor ART response , and underlines the need for rapid , inexpensive tests to identify the most common drug resistance mutations .

BACKGROUND	Mirror therapy ( MT ) and electromyography-triggered neuromuscular stimulation ( ETMS ) are both effective treatments for impaired upper limbs following stroke .
BACKGROUND	A combination of these two treatments ( ETMS-MT ) may result in greater gain than either treatment alone .
OBJECTIVE	The feasibility and possible effects of ETMS-MT upon upper extremity function were investigated in stroke patients .
METHODS	Thirteen post-acute stroke patients were randomly assigned to an immediate ETMS-MT group or a delayed ETMS-MT group and then underwent an @-week training program .
METHODS	The immediate ETMS-MT group received ETMS-MT in addition to physical and occupational therapy ( PT+OT ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	They then received only PT+OT for the next @ weeks .
METHODS	In the delayed ETMS-MT group , interventions were provided in the reverse order .
METHODS	The main outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) .
RESULTS	The immediate ETMS-MT group showed significantly greater gain in FMA in the first @ weeks .
RESULTS	The delayed ETMS-MT group showed significantly greater gain in active range of motion during the latter @ weeks .
RESULTS	No adverse effects were reported following ETMS-MT .
CONCLUSIONS	ETMS-MT might be as effective as independent MT or ETMS without causing any side effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should focus upon the direct comparisons between independent and combined interventions .

BACKGROUND	Gold-standard assessment of acute wound healing has traditionally been through histological analysis of biopsied tissue .
BACKGROUND	However , this process is invasive with recognized side-effects .
BACKGROUND	Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) is a noninvasive technique generating high-resolution real-time images of cutaneous architecture .
OBJECTIVE	To compare OCT with histological assessment of in vivo acute wound healing and ascertain the level of agreement between modalities for measurement of defined cutaneous structures .
METHODS	Punch biopsies ( @mm ) were harvested from @ healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Wounds healed by secondary intention until they were re-excised @ , @ , @ or @days later depending on random group allocation .
METHODS	Wounds were assessed weekly for @weeks using OCT and compared with histological findings derived from time-matched biopsies .
METHODS	Dimensions of four cutaneous structures were measured using both modalities and the level of agreement was established by Bland-Altman analysis .
METHODS	The mean greyscale value ( MGV ) of the upper reticular dermis was derived from OCT images at all time points .
RESULTS	Both techniques showed anatomical congruity in normal and wounded skin with correlating architectural changes associated with inflammatory , proliferative and remodelling wound healing phases .
RESULTS	MGV was significantly increased @weeks after wounding ( P = @ ) and may represent a novel measure of wound fibrosis .
RESULTS	Despite good association of histomorphometric values with low but consistent bias ( range -@ to @m ) , Bland-Altman plots demonstrated poor agreement between OCT and histology .
CONCLUSIONS	Optical coherence tomography enabled accurate assessment of healing tissue comparable with histological analysis of biopsy specimens .
CONCLUSIONS	This noninvasive tool is highly suited to wound assessment and may represent a diagnostic alternative to punch biopsies .

OBJECTIVE	Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is commoner in patients with fluid-retaining states than in those without fluid retention , in men than in women , and worsens with aging .
OBJECTIVE	In men , OSA severity is related to the amount of fluid shifting out of the legs overnight , but a cause-effect relationship is not established .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to test the hypothesis that mimicking fluid overload during sleep would increase severity of OSA more in older ( @ years ) than in younger men ( < @ years ) .
METHODS	Randomized , single-blind , double crossover study .
METHODS	Research sleep laboratory .
METHODS	Seven older and @ younger men with non-severe or no sleep apnea , matched for body mass index .
METHODS	During the control arm , normal saline was infused to keep the vein open .
METHODS	During intervention , subjects received an intravenous bolus of normal saline ( @ mL/kg body weight ) after sleep onset while they were wearing compression stockings to prevent fluid accumulation in the legs .
RESULTS	Compared to younger men , infusion of similar amounts of saline in older men caused a greater increase in neck circumference ( P < @ ) and in the AHI ( @ @ vs. @ @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Older men are more susceptible to the adverse effects of intravenous fluid loading on obstructive sleep apnea severity than younger men .
CONCLUSIONS	This may be due to age-related differences in the amount of fluid accumulating in the neck or upper airway collapsibility in response to intravenous fluid loading .
CONCLUSIONS	These possibilities remain to be tested in future studies .

OBJECTIVE	Biopsy confirmed that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) may naturally regress or progress .
OBJECTIVE	Currently , the risk assessment for CIN progression to cervical cancer is still not satisfactory in clinical practice .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated copy number and protein expression of TP@ and MYC and explored the possibility to use them as progression biomarkers .
METHODS	Copy numbers of TP@ and MYC , as well as human papilloma virus ( HPV ) integration status , were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in @ patients with CIN and @ patients with cervical cancer .
METHODS	Corresponding protein expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry .
METHODS	Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to measure the diagnostic test performance for the detection of cervical cancer from CIN .
METHODS	Sensitivity and specificity values of biomarkers were calculated .
RESULTS	The average copy number and expression of TP@ and MYC , as well as the HPV integration rate , increased in the progression of CIN to cervical cancer .
RESULTS	Receiver operating characteristic analysis for detection of cervical cancer resulted in area under the curve ( AUC ) values of TP@ copy number ( AUC , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ) , MYC copy number ( AUC , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , TP@ expression ( AUC , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and HPV-@ integration ( AUC , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	MYC expression was not able to statistically distinguish cancer from CIN ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The combinations increased the specificity slightly but not sensitivity .
RESULTS	Among them , TP@ amplification showed the best diagnostic performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Amplification and overexpression of TP@ and MYC , and HPV integration rate , are associated with the transition of CIN to cervical cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies on these biomarkers will help to assess the risk of CIN progression .

BACKGROUND	Discontinuations and/or interruptions in aspirin therapy for secondary cardioprotection due to upper gastrointestinal ( UGI ) complications or symptoms have been shown to increase the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events .
BACKGROUND	PA@ is a coordinated-delivery , combination tablet consisting of enteric-coated aspirin ( EC-ASA ) @ mg and immediate-release ( IR ) omeprazole @ mg .
METHODS	Two identically-designed , @-month , randomized , double-blind trials evaluated PA@ vs. EC-ASA @ mg in a secondary cardiovascular disease prevention population taking aspirin @ mg daily for @ months and at risk for ASA-associated gastric ulcers ( GUs ) .
METHODS	The combined study population was @ subjects ( @ randomized to PA@ , @ to EC-ASA @ mg ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of endoscopically-determined gastric ulceration over @ months .
METHODS	Safety outcomes included the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) and UGI symptoms .
RESULTS	Significantly fewer PA@-treated subjects ( @ % ) developed endoscopic GUs vs. EC-ASA @ mg-treated subjects ( @ % ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall occurrence of MACE was low ( @ % ) , with no significant differences between treatments in types or incidence of MACE .
RESULTS	PA@-treated subjects had significantly fewer UGI symptoms ( P < @ ) and significantly fewer discontinuations due to pre-specified UGI adverse events ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	PA@ reduced the incidence of endoscopic GUs compared to EC-ASA @ mg , but with a similar cardiovascular event profile .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to fewer UGI symptoms , continuation on aspirin therapy was greater in the PA@ treatment arm .

BACKGROUND	Our aim was to demonstrate the potential effects of diet on gas-related symptoms .
METHODS	The effect of a low-flatulogenic test diet ( restricted to foodstuffs low in fermentable residues ; n = @ ) was compared to that of a balanced control diet ( Mediterranean type ; n = @ ) in @ patients complaining of flatulence and other abdominal symptoms using a randomized parallel design .
METHODS	The following outcomes were measured daily : number of anal gas evacuations by an event marker , severity of gas-related symptoms by @-@ scales , and sensation of digestive comfort by a -@ ( unpleasant ) to +@ ( pleasant ) scale .
METHODS	Measurements were taken pretreatment for @days on their habitual diet and for @days during the treatment phase .
RESULTS	No pretreatment differences were detected between patients allocated to the control or test diets .
RESULTS	The test diet significantly reduced the number of gas evacuations ( by @ % ; p = @ vs basal diet ) whereas the control diet had a lesser effect ( reduction by @ % ; p = @ vs basal diet ; p = @ vs test diet ) .
RESULTS	Compared to the control diet , the test diet significantly reduced flatulence ( by @ % vs @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) , abdominal distension ( by @ % vs @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) , and enhanced digestive well-being ( by @ % vs @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with gas-related symptoms , a low-flatulogenic diet produces immediate beneficial effects with digestive , cognitive , and emotive dimensions .
CONCLUSIONS	The number of gas evacuations is an objective biological marker of response to dietary treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To test if TIA/stroke electronic decision support in primary care improves management .
METHODS	Multicenter , single-blind , parallel-group , cluster randomized , controlled trial comparing TIA/stroke electronic decision support guided management with usual care .
METHODS	Main outcomes were guideline adherence and @-day stroke risk .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were cerebrovascular/vascular/death / adverse events , cost , and user feedback .
METHODS	Main analysis was logistic regression with a normal random effect for clusters using a generalized linear mixed model .
RESULTS	Twenty-nine clinics were randomized to intervention , @ to control , recruiting @ and @ eligible patients .
RESULTS	More intervention patients received guideline-adherent care ( @/@ ; @ % ) than control patients ( @/@ ; @ % ) ( adjusted odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Ninety-day stroke occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) intervention and @/@ ( @ % ) control patients ( OR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ninety-day TIA or stroke occurrence was lower in the intervention group , @/@ ( @ % ) compared to @/@ ( @ % ) control ( adjusted OR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fewer vascular events/deaths occurred in intervention , @/@ ( @ % ) , than in control patients , @/@ ( @ % ) ( adjusted OR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Treatment cost ratio of @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) favored the intervention without increased adverse events .
RESULTS	Clinician feedback was positive .
CONCLUSIONS	Primary care use of the TIA/stroke electronic decision support tool improves guideline adherence , safely reduces treatment cost , achieves positive user feedback , and may reduce cerebrovascular and vascular event risk following TIA/stroke .
METHODS	This study provides Class II evidence that a primary care electronic decision support tool improves guideline adherence and might reduce @-day stroke risk .

BACKGROUND	Nicotine is a known analgesic .
BACKGROUND	Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that intranasal nicotine administered intraoperatively reduces the need for postoperative opioids .
BACKGROUND	The secondary outcomes included evaluation of both postoperative pain and nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) .
METHODS	Nonsmoking female patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric operations were randomized to receive either @ mg intranasal nicotine ( N = @ ) or placebo spray ( N = @ ) at the conclusion of surgery .
METHODS	Postoperative opioid use converted to intravenous morphine equivalents ( iv MEQ ) and PONV rates were recorded during both the recovery room postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) stay and the first @ postoperative hours .
METHODS	All patients received multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis .
RESULTS	Total iv MEQ were not significantly reduced during the PACU stay in patients receiving nicotine ( median -LSB- interquartile range ( IQR ) -RSB- , @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for nicotine vs. @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for placebo , one-tailed P = @ ) or for the first @ h following PACU discharge ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for nicotine vs. @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for placebo , one-tailed P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For the combined period ( PACU + @-h post-PACU discharge ) , iv MEQ were @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for nicotine and @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg for placebo , one-tailed P = @ .
RESULTS	Compared to placebo , a higher percentage of patients administered nicotine received antiemetics in the PACU ( @ vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intraoperative intranasal nicotine did not exhibit opioid-sparing effect in nonsmoking bariatric female patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite antiemetic prophylaxis , the use of nicotine was associated with the higher frequency of the use of rescue antiemetics in PACU .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of Shugan Jiangu Recipe ( SJR ) on bone mineral density ( BMD ) and serum bone metabolic biochemical markers in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with osteopenia .
METHODS	Totally @ patients of postmenopausal women with breast cancer , who received aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) , were assigned to the treatment group ( @ cases ) and the control group ( @ cases ) by using random digit table .
METHODS	All patients took Caltrate D Tablet ( containing Ca @ mg and Vit D@ @ IU ) , one tablet daily .
METHODS	Patients in the treatment group took SJR , @ g each time , twice daily for @ successive months .
METHODS	The bone mineral density ( BMD ) level was detected before treatment and at months @ after treatment .
METHODS	Levels of bone alkaline phosphatase ( BALP ) , bone gla protein ( BGP ) , tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , and C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen ( CTX-II ) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
METHODS	The drug safety was also assessed .
RESULTS	Compared with before treatment , BMD of L@-@ and femur neck obviously increased in the treatment group at month @ after treatment ( P < @ ) , serum BALP and TRAP decreased ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with before treatment , BMD of L@-@ and femur neck obviously decreased in the control group at month @ after treatment ( P < @ ) , serum BALP and TRAP increased ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the control group , lumbar and femur neck BMD obviously increased , serum levels of BGP and BALP obviously decreased , and serum levels of CTX-II and TRAP obviously increased in the treatment group at month @ after treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse event occurred during the treatment period .
RESULTS	Bone fracture occurred in one case of the control group ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	SJR could attenuate bone loss of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received AIs , increase BMD and improve abnormal bone metabolism .

BACKGROUND	School-based influenza immunization can effectively address accessibility barriers , but injected inactivated influenza vaccines ( IIV ) may not be acceptable to some children and parents in school settings .
OBJECTIVE	To better understand the feasibility of offering intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines ( LAIV ) through schools , we assessed uptake , stakeholder acceptability , and cost of school-based delivery of LAIV compared to IIV .
METHODS	We piloted an open-label cluster randomized trial involving @ elementary schools in Peterborough , Ontario during the @-@ influenza vaccination campaign .
METHODS	Schools were randomized to having students receive IIV or LAIV at publicly-funded school-based clinics organized by the local public health department .
METHODS	We measured the percentage of students vaccinated with at least one dose of influenza vaccine at school .
METHODS	Stakeholder acceptability was evaluated through a questionnaire of parents and interviews of public health department personnel and school principals .
METHODS	We compared the costs per dose of vaccine administered , including staff time and costs of vaccines and supplies .
RESULTS	Single-dose influenza vaccine uptake was higher for the five schools offering LAIV than for the five offering IIV ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Interviews with nine school principals and five public health department personnel suggested that the clinics ran smoothly with little disruption to school routines , and that LAIV was associated with increased efficiency and calmer children .
RESULTS	All interviewees cited unfamiliarity with LAIV and the study recruitment package length as potential reasons for low uptake .
RESULTS	The cost per vaccine dose administered was $ @ for IIV and $ @ for LAIV .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of LAIV in school-based clinics was associated with increased vaccine uptake and the perception among immunizing staff of reduced child anxiety , but also slightly higher vaccine administration costs , compared to IIV .
CONCLUSIONS	However , uptake was low for both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	More effective strategies to promote influenza vaccines and to obtain parent consent may improve vaccine uptake .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the long-term effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention on physical function using a randomized post-test design in the Look AHEAD trial .
METHODS	Overweight and obese ( BMI @ kg m ( -@ ) ) middle-aged and older adults ( aged @-@ years at enrollment ) with type @ diabetes ( n = @ ) at four clinics in Look AHEAD , a trial evaluating an intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) designed to achieve weight loss through caloric restriction and increased physical activity compared to diabetes support and education ( DSE ) , underwent standardized assessments of performance-based physical function including an expanded short physical performance battery ( SPPBexp ) , @-m and @-m walk , and grip and knee extensor strength @ years post-randomization , during the trial 's weight maintenance phase .
RESULTS	Eight years post-randomization , individuals randomized to ILI had better SPPBexp scores -LSB- adjusted mean ( SE ) difference : @ ( @ ) , P = @ -RSB- and faster @-m and @-m walk speeds -LSB- @ ( @ ) m s ( -@ ) , P = @ , and @ ( @ ) m s ( -@ ) , P = @ , respectively -RSB- compared to those randomized to DSE .
RESULTS	Achieved weight loss greatly attenuated the group differences in physical function , and the intervention effect was no longer significant .
CONCLUSIONS	An intensive lifestyle intervention has long-term benefits for mobility function in overweight and obese middle-aged and older individuals with type @ diabetes .

CONCLUSIONS	Although children vaccinated with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) had fewer episodes of acute otitis media ( AOM ) , this trial was unable to prove a simultaneous decrease in nasopharyngeal carriage .
OBJECTIVE	Carriage rates of AOM pathogens in the nasopharynx are high among children , and colonization is the first step towards infection .
OBJECTIVE	The possible impact of PCV on carriage is therefore of interest , particularly in children with recurrent AOM .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to examine the effect of heptavalent PCV on carriage of AOM pathogens in children at high risk of developing recurrent disease , and to monitor carriage of resistant pathogens in vaccinated and unvaccinated children .
METHODS	A total of @ children with an onset of AOM before @ months of age , @ of whom developed recurrent disease , were enrolled in a trial .
METHODS	Fifty-two children were vaccinated and all were closely monitored for @ years .
RESULTS	There was no difference statistically between vaccinated children and controls concerning the carriage of any of the major AOM pathogens .
RESULTS	There was evidence of within-child clustering for S. pneumoniae ( p = @ ) and H. influenzae ( p < @ ) , indicating that children continued to carry either species over time .
RESULTS	Resistance rates were generally low and comparable with national levels .

OBJECTIVE	Locoregional anesthesia is an effective method for evaluating cerebral function during carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) .
OBJECTIVE	Landmark-guided regional anesthesia ( RA ) is currently used for CEA and can provoke substantial perioperative hypertension .
OBJECTIVE	Ultrasound-guided RA ( US-RA ) is a new method for performing RA in CEA ; however , the effect on sympathetic activity and blood pressure is uncertain .
OBJECTIVE	This study assessed early sympathetic activity during CEA in US-RA compared with general anesthesia ( GA ) .
METHODS	Patients were prospectively randomized to receive US-RA ( n = @ ) or GA ( n = @ ) for CEA .
METHODS	The primary end point was the change in systolic arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia ( just before starting surgery ) comparing US-RA with GA. .
METHODS	We also recorded heart rate and analyzed concentrations of plasma blood hormones , including cortisol , metanephrine , and normetanephrine at five different times .
METHODS	Creatinine kinase , troponin I , and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were analyzed to detect potential changes in cardiac biomarkers during the procedure .
RESULTS	Systolic arterial blood pressure ( mean standard deviation ) increased significantly in US-RA patients compared with GA patients even before surgery was initiated ( @ @ mm Hg vs @ @ mm Hg ; P < @ ) , then remained elevated during the entire surgery and returned to baseline values @ hour after admission to the postoperative anesthesia care unit .
RESULTS	Heart rate ( US-RA : @ @ beats/min , GA : @ @ beats/min ; P < @ ) and cortisol levels ( US-RA : @ @ g/L , GA : @ @ g/L ; P = @ ) were also significantly higher in the US-RA group after induction of anesthesia .
RESULTS	Other values did not differ .
CONCLUSIONS	The US-RA technique for CEA induces temporary intraoperative hypertension and an increase in stress hormone levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , US-RA is a feasible , effective , and safe form of locoregional for CEA that enables targeted placement of low volumes of local anesthesia under direct visualization .

BACKGROUND	Adults living in the sunny Australian climate are at high risk of skin cancer , but vitamin D deficiency ( defined here as a serum @-hydroxyvitamin D ( @ ( OH ) D ) concentration of less than @ nmol/L ) is also common .
BACKGROUND	Vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for a range of diseases .
BACKGROUND	However , the optimal strategies to achieve and maintain vitamin D adequacy ( sun exposure , vitamin D supplementation or both ) , and whether sun exposure itself has benefits over and above initiating synthesis of vitamin D , remain unclear .
BACKGROUND	The Sun Exposure and Vitamin D Supplementation ( SEDS ) Study aims to compare the effectiveness of sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation for the management of vitamin D insufficiency , and to test whether these management strategies differentially affect markers of immune and cardio-metabolic function .
METHODS	The SEDS Study is a multi-centre , randomised controlled trial of two different daily doses of vitamin D supplementation , and placebo , in conjunction with guidance on two different patterns of sun exposure .
METHODS	Participants recruited from across Australia are aged @-@ years and have a recent vitamin D test result showing a serum @ ( OH ) D level of @-@ nmol/L .
CONCLUSIONS	This paper discusses the rationale behind the study design , and considers the challenges but necessity of data collection within a non-institutionalised adult population , in order to address the study aims .
CONCLUSIONS	We also discuss the challenges of participant recruitment and retention , ongoing engagement of referring medical practitioners and address issues of compliance and participant retention .

OBJECTIVE	Patching of the operative eye is occasionally used in pediatric strabismus surgery .
OBJECTIVE	The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological and physiologic effects of patching after operation by multifactorial methods .
METHODS	We analyzed the perioperative behaviors of @ children with strabismus conducted from June @ to July @ in this prospective longitudinal study .
METHODS	The children were randomized into @ groups .
METHODS	Patients in the patching group underwent postoperative patching and others received no patching .
METHODS	Main outcome measures included The Faces Pain Scale-Revised score or numerical rating scales score , Children 's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) score , crying time , and preoperative and postoperative physiologic parameters .
RESULTS	Crying time was significantly longer in the patching group than in the no patching group , but self-report scores showed no difference in the groups .
RESULTS	Repeated-measures analysis of variance on ranks revealed that postoperative CHEOPS score was lower in the no patching group than in the patching group , whereas no physiologic parameters were significantly different in the @ groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Patching is not necessary for reducing postoperative pain or the risk of infection in children undergoing strabismus surgery .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of a physical activity ( PA ) intervention on brain and behavioral indices of executive control in preadolescent children .
METHODS	Two hundred twenty-one children ( @-@ years ) were randomly assigned to a @-month afterschool PA program or a wait-list control .
METHODS	In addition to changes in fitness ( maximal oxygen consumption ) , electrical activity in the brain ( P@-ERP ) and behavioral measures ( accuracy , reaction time ) of executive control were collected by using tasks that modulated attentional inhibition and cognitive flexibility .
RESULTS	Fitness improved more among intervention participants from pretest to posttest compared with the wait-list control ( @ mL/kg per minute , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ to @ ; d = @ for group difference in pre-to-post change score ) .
RESULTS	Intervention participants exhibited greater improvements from pretest to posttest in inhibition ( @ % , @ % CI : @ to @ ; d = @ ) and cognitive flexibility ( @ % , @ % CI : @ to @ ; d = @ for group difference in pre-to-post change score ) compared with control .
RESULTS	Only the intervention group increased attentional resources from pretest to posttest during tasks requiring increased inhibition ( @ V , @ % CI : @ to @ ; d = @ ) and cognitive flexibility ( @ V , @ % CI : @ to @ ; d = @ ) .
RESULTS	Finally , improvements in brain function on the inhibition task ( r = @ ) and performance on the flexibility task correlated with intervention attendance ( r = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention enhanced cognitive performance and brain function during tasks requiring greater executive control .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings demonstrate a causal effect of a PA program on executive control , and provide support for PA for improving childhood cognition and brain health .

BACKGROUND	Recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( R/M-SCCHN ) overexpresses v@ integrin .
BACKGROUND	Cilengitide selectively inhibits v@ and v@ integrins and is investigated as a treatment strategy .
METHODS	The phase I/II study ADVANTAGE evaluated cilengitide combined with cisplatin , @-fluorouracil , and cetuximab ( PFE ) in R/M-SCCHN .
METHODS	The phase II part reported here was an open-label , randomized , controlled trial investigating progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
METHODS	Patients received up to six cycles of PFE alone or combined with cilengitide @ mg once ( CIL@W ) or twice ( CIL@W ) weekly .
METHODS	Thereafter , patients received maintenance therapy ( cilengitide arms : cilengitide plus cetuximab ; PFE-alone arm : cetuximab only ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
RESULTS	One hundred and eighty-two patients were treated .
RESULTS	Median PFS per investigator read was similar for CIL@W + PFE , CIL@W + PFE , and PFE alone ( @ , @ , and @ months , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Accordingly , median overall survival and objective response rates were not improved with cilengitide ( @ months/@ % , @ months/@ % , and @ months/@ % , respectively ) .
RESULTS	No clinically meaningful safety differences were observed between groups .
RESULTS	None of the tested biomarkers ( expression of integrins , CD@ , Ki-@ , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor @ , vascular endothelial-cadherin , type IV collagen , epidermal growth factor receptor , or p@ for human papillomavirus ) were predictive of outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Neither of the cilengitide-containing regimens demonstrated a PFS benefit over PFE alone in R/M-SCCHN patients .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine changes in physical inactivity from baseline to @ years and to identify factors associated with and predictive of physical inactivity among individuals with type @ diabetes enrolled in the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics ( DIAD ) study .
METHODS	DIAD was a prospective randomized screening trial that assessed the prevalence of silent ischemia in asymptomatic patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	Subjects were recruited from diabetes and primary care practices at @ centers throughout the United States and Canada .
METHODS	This is a secondary data analysis of the physical activity data ( type and hours/week ) collected .
METHODS	No intervention was conducted .
RESULTS	In all subjects , physical inactivity rose from @ % at baseline to @ % at @ years ( S = @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	This change was significant in both men ( S = @ ; P < @ ) , increasing from @ % to @ % , and women ( S = @ ; P < @ ) , increasing from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	Gender differences were noted in several factors associated with baseline physical inactivity as well as in factors predictive of physical inactivity at @ years .
RESULTS	Important factors associated at both time points included lower level of education , current employment , presence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy , and indicators of overweight/obesity .
RESULTS	Baseline physical inactivity was strongly predictive of physical inactivity at @ years ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Gender-related differences were noted in factors associated with and predictive of physical inactivity .

BACKGROUND	We have previously observed that intravaginal prasterone ( dehydroepiandrosterone , DHEA ) improved all domains of female sexual dysfunction ( FSD ) .
OBJECTIVE	Investigate the influence of moderate/severe pain at sexual activity ( dyspareunia ) ( MSD ) at baseline on FSD following prasterone administration .
METHODS	The effect of daily administration of prasterone ( @ , @ mg , @ mg or @mg ) for @ weeks on FSD in @ postmenopausal women with or without MSD at baseline was evaluated in a prospective , randomized , double-blind , and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial .
METHODS	Differences were examined on desire , arousal and orgasm .
RESULTS	Comparable benefits were observed in women not having MSD ( n = @ ) vs. those having MSD ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The benefits over placebo in prasterone-treated women for desire , avoiding intimacy and vaginal dryness as well as for the total sexual domain of the MENQOL ( Menopause Specific Quality of Life ) questionnaire , ranged between @ % and @ % with P values of < @ or < @ except in one out of @ subgroups .
RESULTS	For the arousal/sensation , arousal/lubrication and summary score of the ASF ( Abbreviated Sexual Function ) questionnaire , in the MSD + group , improvements of @ % ( P = @ ) , @ % ( P = @ ) and @ % ( P = @ ) were observed over placebo , respectively , while similar differences ( @ % , @ % and @ % ) did not reach statistical significance in the MSD - group having up to only @ prasterone-treated women compared with @ in the MSD + group .
CONCLUSIONS	No MSD at baseline does not apparently affect the effects of intravaginal prasterone on sexual dysfunction .
CONCLUSIONS	Knowing the absence of significant effects of estrogens on FSD , the present data suggest that vulvovaginal atrophy ( VVA ) and vulvovaginal sexual dysfunction ( VVSD ) are two different consequences of sex steroid deficiency at menopause which can respond independently .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the present data seriously question the justification of pain being part of FSD as well as the separation of FSD into separate domains .

BACKGROUND	Functional neck/shoulder stiffness is one of the most well-known indications for acupuncture treatment in Japan .
BACKGROUND	There is little evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for functional neck/shoulder stiffness .
BACKGROUND	Research using two different placebos may allow an efficient method to tease apart the components of real acupuncture from various kinds of ` non-specific ' effects such as ritual with touch or ritual alone .
BACKGROUND	Herein , we describe a protocol of an ongoing , single-centre , randomised , placebo-controlled trial which aims to assess whether , in functional neck/shoulder stiffness , acupuncture treatment with skin piercing has a specific effect over two types of placebo : skin-touching plus ritual or ritual alone .
METHODS	Six acupuncturists and @ patients with functional neck/shoulder stiffness are randomly assigned to four treatment groups : genuine acupuncture penetrating the skin , skin-touch placebo or no-touch placebo needles in a double-blind manner ( practitioner-patient blinding ) or no-treatment control group .
METHODS	Each acupuncturist applies a needle to each of four acupoints ( Bladder@ , Small Intestine@ , Gallbladder@ and Bladder@ ) in the neck/shoulder to @ patients .
METHODS	Before , immediately after and @ hours after the treatment , patients are asked about the intensity of their neck/shoulder stiffness .
METHODS	After the treatment , practitioners and patients are asked to guess whether the treatment is `` penetrating '' , `` skin-touch '' or `` no-touch '' or to record `` can not identify the treatment '' .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition to intention-to-treat analysis , we will conduct subgroup analysis based on practitioners ' or patients ' guesses to discuss the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments with skin piercing and various placebo controls .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of practitioner and patient blinding will be discussed .
CONCLUSIONS	We believe this study will further distinguish the role of different components of acupuncture .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the effects of @ weeks of CT and AT , which training impulse ( total external workload and perceived exertion ) , are similar on power associated at VO@ peak ( pVO@ peak ) and cardiorespiratory responses of patient with CAD .
METHODS	Eighteen male with CAD ( @ @ years , @ @ cm , @ @ kg , fraction of ejection = @ @ ) performed @ weeks of CT ( n = @ ) or AT ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	pVO@ peak , maximal and first ventilatory threshold values of oxygen uptake ( VO@ peak , VO@-vt ) and heart rate ( HRmax , HR-vt ) were measured before and after training session .
METHODS	Total training impulse ( exercise rehabilitation and other paramedical actions ) were evaluated and harmonized between AT and CT according to Foster et al. formula ( @ ) RESULTS : No significant difference were found in training impulse between AT and CT ( @ @ vs @ @ U , P = NS ) .
METHODS	VO@ pic increased after AT ( @ @ vs @ @ mL O@/min/kg , P < @ ) and remained unchanged after CT ( @ @ vs @ @ , P = NS ) .
METHODS	Four weeks of training induced significant increase in pVO@ peak , VO@-vt and FC-vt , expressed in absolute or relative value ( P < @,@ ) , without any difference between AT and CT modalities ( P = NS ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Improving pVO@ pic following an exercise training does not necessarily preclude an improvement in coronary VO@ pic .
CONCLUSIONS	pVO@ peak was not improved with the same cardiorespiratory adaptations between AT and CT. .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , there seems important to measure gas exchanges of subject with CAD during the incremental test and identify the respective part of muscular and cardiorespiratory functions in exercise exhaustion .

BACKGROUND	The UK lags behind many European countries in terms of cancer survival .
BACKGROUND	Initiatives to address this disparity have focused on barriers to presentation , symptom recognition , and referral for specialist investigation .
BACKGROUND	Selection of patients for further investigation has come under particular scrutiny , although preferences for referral thresholds in the UK population have not been studied .
BACKGROUND	We investigated preferences for diagnostic testing for colorectal , lung , and pancreatic cancers in primary-care attendees .
METHODS	In a vignette-based study , researchers recruited individuals aged at least @ years attending @ general practices in three areas of England between Dec @ , @ , and Aug @ , @ .
METHODS	Participants completed up to three of @ vignettes ( four for each of lung , pancreatic , and colorectal cancers ) , which were randomly assigned .
METHODS	The vignettes outlined a set of symptoms , the risk that these symptoms might indicate cancer ( @ % , @ % , @ % , or @ % ) , the relevant testing process , probable treatment , possible alternative diagnoses , and prognosis if cancer were identified .
METHODS	Participants were asked whether they would opt for diagnostic testing on the basis of the information in the vignette .
RESULTS	@ participants completed @ vignettes .
RESULTS	@ individuals ( @ % ) opted for investigation in their first vignette .
RESULTS	We recorded no strong evidence that participants were more likely to opt for investigation with a @ % increase in risk of cancer ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) , although the association between risk and opting for investigation was strong when colorectal cancer was analysed alone ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In multivariable analysis , age had an effect in all three cancer models : participants aged @-@ years were significantly more likely to opt for investigation than were those aged @-@ years , and those aged @ years or older were less likely .
RESULTS	Other variables associated with increased likelihood of opting for investigation were shorter travel times to testing centre ( colorectal and lung cancers ) , a family history of cancer ( colorectal and lung cancers ) , and higher household income ( colorectal and pancreatic cancers ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants in our sample expressed a clear preference for diagnostic testing at all risk levels , and individuals want to be tested at risk levels well below those stipulated by UK guidelines .
CONCLUSIONS	This willingness should be considered during design of cancer pathways , particularly in primary care .
CONCLUSIONS	The public engagement with our study should encourage general practitioners to involve patients in referral decision making .

OBJECTIVE	Little is known about the benefit of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) - positive patients with high viral load and normal levels of alanine aminotransferase .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effects of single and combination therapies in immune-tolerant patients with chronic hepatitis B.
METHODS	In a double-blind study , nucleos ( t ) ide-nave patients with high levels of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA who were positive for HBeAg and had normal levels of alanine aminotransferase were randomly assigned to groups given either oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF , @ mg ) and placebo ( n = @ ) or a combination of TDF ( @ mg ) and emtricitabine ( @ mg , n = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	The primary end point was proportion of patients with serum levels of HBV DNA < @ IU/mL at week @ .
RESULTS	The study population ( mean age was @ years ; @ % were Asian ) was predominantly infected with HBV genotypes B and C ( @ % ) , @ % were HBeAg positive with a mean baseline level of HBV DNA of @ log@ IU/mL .
RESULTS	At week @ , @ % of patients ( @ of @ ) in the TDF + placebo group and @ % of patients ( @ of @ ) in the TDF + emtricitabine group had levels of HBV DNA < @ IU/mL ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No patients were found to have viral resistance to therapy .
RESULTS	HBeAg seroconversion occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) , all in the TDF + placebo group ; no patient had loss of hepatitis B surface antigen .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , female sex ( odds ratio = @ ; P = @ ) and TDF + emtricitabine treatment ( odds ratio = @ ; P = @ ) were associated with a favorable response .
RESULTS	Both regimens were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	In HBeAg-positive patients with chronic HBV infection , high viral loads , normal levels of alanine aminotransferase , and therapy with the combination of TDF and emtricitabine provided better viral suppression than TDF alone , although rates of HBeAg seroconversion and hepatitis B surface antigen loss were low .

BACKGROUND	Previous global studies examined etanercept ( ETN ) + methotrexate ( MTX ) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , but included few subjects from Latin America .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETN + MTX versus a standard-of-care disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) + MTX in Latin American subjects with moderate to severe active RA despite MTX therapy .
METHODS	This open-label , active-comparator study ( NCT@ ) randomized subjects @:@ to ETN @ mg/wk + MTX or investigator-selected DMARD ( sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine ) + MTX ( ETN + MTX , n = @ ; DMARD + MTX , n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was the proportion achieving American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) @ at week @ .
METHODS	Secondary end points included ACR@/@ , disease activity score ( DAS ) @ measures , and mean change in modified total Sharp score .
METHODS	Patient-reported outcomes were the Health Assessment Questionnaire , @-item Short-Form , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , Work Productivity and Activity Impairment : RA ( WPAI : RA ) , and Caregiver Burden and Resource Utilization .
METHODS	Statistical analyses were stratified by country ; test and analysis of covariance were used .
METHODS	Adverse events were monitored .
RESULTS	More subjects achieved ACR@ at week @ with ETN + MTX versus DMARD + MTX ( @ % vs @ % , respectively ) , in addition to secondary end points ( P < @ for all ) ; mean change in modified total Sharp score was lower for the ETN + MTX group ( @ vs @ , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Improvements in patient-reported outcomes favored ETN + MTX for Health Assessment Questionnaire , @-item Short-Form , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for depression , WPAI : RA , and Caregiver Burden and Resource Utilization emergency department visits for RA ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall , adverse events were similar between the groups ( @ % vs @ % , ) ; serious adverse events were also similar ( @ % vs @ % ) .
RESULTS	The rate of overall infections was higher with ETN + MTX ( @ % ) than DMARD + MTX ( @ % , P @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Consistent with published global data among RA patients with inadequate response to MTX , adding ETN to MTX demonstrated better efficacy than adding one other conventional DMARD to MTX .
CONCLUSIONS	No new safety issues were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	ETN + MTX provided favorable benefit-risk profile among RA patients from LA region .

BACKGROUND	Despite national guidelines recommending bone mineral density screening with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) in women aged @ years and older , many women do not receive initial screening .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effectiveness of health system and patient-level interventions designed to increase appropriate DXA testing and osteoporosis treatment through ( @ ) an invitation to self-refer for DXA ( self-referral ) ; ( @ ) self-referral plus patient educational materials ; and ( @ ) usual care ( UC , physician referral ) .
METHODS	Parallel , group-randomized , controlled trials performed at Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) and Kaiser Permanente Georgia ( KPG ) .
METHODS	Women aged @ years and older without a DXA in past @ years .
METHODS	DXA completion rates @ days after intervention mailing and osteoporosis medication receipt @ days after initial intervention mailing .
RESULTS	From > @,@ eligible women , those randomized to self-referral were significantly more likely to receive a DXA than UC ( @ % -@ % self-referral vs. @ % -@ % UC , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	DXA rates did not significantly increase with patient educational materials .
RESULTS	Osteoporosis was detected in a greater proportion of self-referral women compared with UC ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The number needed to receive an invitation to result in a DXA in KPNW and KPG regions was approximately @ and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	New osteoporosis prescription rates were low ( @ % -@ % ) but significantly greater among self-referral versus UC in KPNW .
CONCLUSIONS	DXA rates significantly improved with a mailed invitation to schedule a scan without physician referral .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing women the opportunity to self-refer may be an effective , low-cost strategy to increase access for recommended osteoporosis screening .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to characterize trastuzumab population pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor @-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer and the relationship of trastuzumab PK with patient response .
METHODS	A nonlinear mixed effects PK model was built using data from the ToGA study .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to intravenous trastuzumab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone .
METHODS	The influence of demographic , laboratory , and disease characteristics on PK parameters was assessed .
METHODS	An exploratory exposure-response analysis compared various PK parameters at steady state with best overall tumor response and overall survival ( OS ) .
RESULTS	Trastuzumab PK was best described by a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear ( Michaelis-Menten ) elimination from the central compartment .
RESULTS	Total clearance ( and half-life ) of trastuzumab was concentration-dependent .
RESULTS	Body weight , prior gastrectomy , and serum albumin had the greatest influence on trastuzumab PK ; increasing weight and decreasing albumin levels were associated with increased clearance , while prior gastrectomy correlated with decreased clearance .
RESULTS	Median values for AUC , Cmax , and Cmin were lower in patients with progressive disease ( PD ) than other response categories , although the @ interquartile ranges overlapped .
RESULTS	Patients with the lowest Cmin had the highest PD rate and a shorter OS .
CONCLUSIONS	In the advanced gastric cancer population , trastuzumab PK was best described by a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination .
CONCLUSIONS	Predicted PK exposure was lower than previously reported for breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with the lowest Cmin had a shorter OS and the highest PD rate , but a distinct correlation was not observed for tumor response .

BACKGROUND	Whilst surgery will face an imminent workforce shortage , an increasing majority of students decide against a surgical career .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the current career expectations of medical students and tested a hands-on virtual reality ( VR ) intervention as a tool to increase their interest in surgery .
METHODS	Randomly selected medical students of the University of Basel received a short questionnaire to rank their interest in five different postgraduate working environments prior to a lecture .
METHODS	After the lecture they participated in a hands-on VR demonstration .
METHODS	Thereafter an online questionnaire regarding workplace expectations , surgery and VR was sent to the students .
RESULTS	The online questionnaire response rate was @ % ( @/@ ) .
RESULTS	Before using the VR intervention , a nonsurgical career was preferred by the majority of students , followed by a surgical career , cross-disciplinary specialties , research and , finally , nonclinical work .
RESULTS	Surgery ( n = @ , @ % ) and emergency medicine ( n = @ , @ % ) were rated as incompatible with a good work-life balance .
RESULTS	Further drawbacks to surgery were apprehension of competitive mentality , unclear career perspectives and longer working hours .
RESULTS	The VR intervention had limited impact on re-ranking the five working sectors and slightly increased the students ' interest in surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Students ' work environment expectations , their declining interest in a surgical career and the increasing need for surgeons represent challenges for surgical societies to address , in order to improve the attractiveness of surgery amongst students .
CONCLUSIONS	VR sessions may be integrated as part of the actions required to improve students ' interest in a surgical career and should be further evaluated within controlled study designs .

OBJECTIVE	Prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary bypass aggravates the degree of inflammation and coagulopathy .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the influence of @ % hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) @/@ @ on coagulation and inflammation compared with albumin when used for both cardiopulmonary bypass priming and perioperative fluid therapy in patients undergoing complex valvular heart surgery .
METHODS	Fifty four patients were randomly allocated into albumin-HES , albumin-nonHES , and HES-HES groups .
METHODS	The cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was primed with @ % albumin in the albumin-HES and albumin-nonHES group , and with HES in the HES-HES group .
METHODS	As perioperative fluid , only plasmalyte was used in the albumin-nonHES group whereas HES was used up to @ mL/kg in the albumin-HES and albumin-HES group .
METHODS	Serial assessments of coagulation profiles using the rotational thromboelastometry and inflammatory markers ( tissue necrosis factor - , interleukin-@ , and interleukin-@ ) were performed .
RESULTS	Patients ' characteristics and the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass ( albumin-HES ; @ min , HES-HES ; @ min , albumin-nonHES ; @ min ) were all similar among the groups .
RESULTS	Postoperative coagulation profiles demonstrated sporadic increases in clot formation time and coagulation time , without any differences in the actual amount of perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements among the groups .
RESULTS	Also , inflammatory markers showed significant activation after cardiopulmonary bypass without any differences among the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Even in the presence of prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary bypass , HES seemed to yield similar influence on the ensuing coagulopathy and inflammatory response when used for priming and perioperative fluid therapy following complex valvular heart surgery compared with conventional fluid regimen including albumin and plasmalyte .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the reproducibility of brain-activation and eye-movement patterns in a saccade paradigm when comparing subjects , tasks , and magnetic resonance ( MR ) systems .
METHODS	Forty-five healthy adults at two different sites ( n = @ ) performed saccade tasks with varying levels of target predictability : predictable ( PRED ) , position predictable ( pPRED ) , time predictable ( tPRED ) , and prosaccade ( SAC ) .
METHODS	Eye-movement pattern was tested with a repeated-measures analysis of variance .
METHODS	Activation maps reproducibility were estimated with the cluster overlap Jaccard index and signal variance coefficient of determination for within-subjects test-retest data , and for between-subjects data from the same and different sites .
RESULTS	In all groups latencies increased with decreasing target predictability : PRED < pPRED < tPRED < SAC ( P < @,@ ) .
RESULTS	Activation overlap was good to fair ( > @ ) in all tasks in the within-subjects test-retest comparisons and poor ( < @ ) in the tPRED for different subjects .
RESULTS	The overlap of the different tasks for within-groups data was higher ( @-@ @ ) than for the between-groups data ( @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Activation consistency was @-@ % in the same subjects , @-@ % in different subjects , and @-@ % in different sites .
RESULTS	In SAC , the activation found in the same and in different subjects was more consistent than in other tasks ( @-@ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The predictive saccade tasks produced evidence for brain-activation and eye-movement reproducibility .

OBJECTIVE	The cortisol awakening response ( CAR ) is a natural metabolic response that can be potentiated by negative cognitive-emotional processes , including stress appraisals , negative affect , and rumination .
OBJECTIVE	Psychological distress and the CAR are not consistently related , however .
OBJECTIVE	Individual differences in aspects of dispositional mindfulness which reflect how people relate to negative thoughts and emotions may help explain such inconsistencies .
OBJECTIVE	We tested whether the tendency to ( @ ) label and describe inner experiences and ( @ ) accept negative thoughts and feelings without judgment moderated the association between psychological distress and the CAR .
METHODS	Self-reported dispositional mindfulness , perceived stress , anxiety , negative affect , rumination , and the CAR were assessed among overweight/obese women .
METHODS	Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether dispositional mindfulness moderated the relationship between indicators of psychological distress and the CAR .
RESULTS	While psychological distress was consistently positively related to the CAR , these associations were qualified by significant interactions with both components of dispositional mindfulness .
RESULTS	Psychological distress was associated with the CAR at lower levels of dispositional mindfulness but not at higher levels .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to describe and accept experiences may buffer the impact of psychological distress on physiological arousal .
CONCLUSIONS	These metacognitive processes may be important moderators in unraveling the complex relationship between psychological distress and physiological stress reactivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is recommended to replicate this approach in other populations .

BACKGROUND	Consistent evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk .
BACKGROUND	However , it is unclear whether OSA is underdiagnosed in the cardiology outpatient setting .
BACKGROUND	In the present study , we prospectively evaluated the potential underdiagnosis of OSA in several subspecialties from a tertiary cardiology university hospital .
METHODS	Consecutive outpatients from five subspecialties ( hypertension , coronary , arrhythmia , heart failure ( HF ) , valvular heart disease ) were studied .
METHODS	We performed anthropometric measurements , assessed the risk of OSA using the Berlin Questionnaire and evaluated the prior diagnosis and treatment for OSA .
METHODS	In a subset of patients randomly selected , we performed portable sleep monitoring to objectively evaluate the presence of OSA ( defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index @ events/h of sleep ) .
RESULTS	We evaluated @ patients ( @ from each subspecialty ) .
RESULTS	The mean age and body mass index ( BMI ) were @years and @ kg/m ( @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	We found that @ % ( @ patients ) had a high risk for OSA ( Berlin Questionnaire ) .
RESULTS	However , only @ ( @ % ) of these patients had a previous diagnosis of OSA .
RESULTS	Of those , only six patients were receiving specific OSA treatment .
RESULTS	Fifty patients ( @ from each specialty ) participated in sleep studies .
RESULTS	No differences were found in patients who underwent sleep monitoring and those who did not .
RESULTS	We found a high frequency of OSA ( @ % ) , varying from @ % ( hypertension group ) to @ % ( HF group ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite significant scientific evidence pointing to OSA as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor , OSA is still underdiagnosed in several cardiology subspecialties .

METHODS	Prospective randomized clinical study .
METHODS	Seventeen bitches of various breeds , aged @years and weighing @ kg requiring total unilateral or bilateral mastectomy .
METHODS	Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine ( @ mgkg ( -@ ) ) and morphine ( @ mgkg ( -@ ) ) intramuscularly .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with propofol ( @ mgkg ( -@ ) ) and midazolam ( @ mgkg ( -@ ) ) intravenously , followed by intubation and maintenance with isoflurane and TLA .
METHODS	Dogs were randomly allocated to receive TLA either with @ % ropivacaine ( group G@ ) or with @ % ropivacaine ( group G@ ) .
METHODS	TLA was performed by insertion of a multihole needle under the skin and infusion of ropivacaine and lactated Ringer 's solution at a fixed volume of @mLkg ( -@ ) .
METHODS	Ropivacaine concentrations in arterial blood were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography .
METHODS	Post-operative pain was assessed using two scales ( University of Melbourne pain scale and a modified composite measure pain scale ) and von Frey filaments , @hours after TLA and at @hour intervals until sensitivity was regained .
METHODS	A score above @ % of the maximum possible score was considered a positive indicator of pain .
RESULTS	Peak plasma concentrations of ropivacaine were measured @minutes after TLA in G@ .
RESULTS	Low concentrations were measured in G@ for @minutes , with subsequent increase .
RESULTS	Analgesic rescue and return of sensitivity occurred at @ and @ hours ( mean SD ) after TLA for G@ and G@ , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Tumescent local anesthesia with ropivacaine provided satisfactory post-operative analgesia that lasted for several hours , with no difference in duration between the concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	No serious side effects were attributed to TLA .

OBJECTIVE	ST-segment resolution ( STR ) after reperfusion therapy has been shown to correlate with prognosis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether acute ECG measurements also correlate with ultimate infarct size .
RESULTS	The INFUSE-AMI trial randomized @ patients with anterior STEMI to intracoronary bolus abciximab vs. no abciximab , and to thrombus aspiration vs. no aspiration .
RESULTS	Infarct size as percentage of total LV mass was calculated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) @ days post intervention .
RESULTS	Five ECG methods were analysed for their ability to predict MRI infarct mass : ( @ ) summed STR across all infarct-related ECG leads ( STR ) ; ( @ ) STR in the single lead with maximum baseline ST-segment elevation ( maxSTR ) ; ( @ ) summed residual ST-segment elevation across all infarct-related leads at @ min post intervention ( ST residual ) ; ( @ ) maximum residual ST-segment elevation in the worst single lead at @ min post intervention ( maxST residual ) ; ( @ ) number of new significant Q-waves ( Qwave ) at @ min .
RESULTS	All ECG methods strongly correlated with @-day MRI infarct mass ( all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Simpler ECG measurements such as maxSTresidual and Qwave were as predictive as more complex measurements .
RESULTS	A subset analysis of @ patients who had microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) determined by MRI @ days post intervention also showed strong correlations of MVO with the ECG measures .
CONCLUSIONS	ST-segment and Q-wave changes after primary PCI in anterior STEMI strongly correlated with @-day infarct size by MRI .
CONCLUSIONS	In particular , maxST residual and Qwave at @ min are simple ECG parameters that offer rapid analysis for prognostication .

BACKGROUND	The quality of evidence for invasive revascularization in intermittent claudication is low or very low .
BACKGROUND	This prospective , randomized , controlled study tested the hypothesis that an invasive treatment strategy versus continued noninvasive treatment improves health-related quality of life after @ year in unselected patients with intermittent claudication .
RESULTS	After clinical and duplex ultrasound assessment , unselected patients with intermittent claudication requesting treatment for claudication were randomly assigned to invasive ( n = @ ) or noninvasive ( n = @ ) treatment groups .
RESULTS	Primary end point was health-related quality of life after @ year , assessed with Medical Outcomes Study Short Form @ version @ and Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire , and secondary end points included walking distances on a graded treadmill .
RESULTS	The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form @ version @ physical component summary ( P < @ ) and @ Medical Outcomes Study Short Form @ version @ physical subscales improved significantly more in the invasive versus the noninvasive treatment group .
RESULTS	Overall , Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire score ( P < @ ) and @ of @ domain scores improved significantly more in the invasive versus the noninvasive treatment group .
RESULTS	Intermittent claudication distance improved significantly in the invasive ( +@ m ) versus the noninvasive ( +@ m ) group ( P = @ ) , whereas the change in maximum walking distance was not significantly different between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	An invasive treatment strategy improves health-related quality of life and intermittent claudication distance after @ year in patients with stable lifestyle-limiting claudication receiving current medical management .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term follow-up data and health-economic assessments are warranted to further establish the role for revascularization in intermittent claudication .

BACKGROUND	Macrosomic fetuses are at increased risk of shoulder dystocia .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare induction of labour with expectant management for large-for-date fetuses for prevention of shoulder dystocia and other neonatal and maternal morbidity associated with macrosomia .
METHODS	We did this pragmatic , randomised controlled trial between Oct @ , @ , and Jan @ , @ , in @ tertiary-care centres in France , Switzerland , and Belgium .
METHODS	Women with singleton fetuses whose estimated weight exceeded the @th percentile , were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) , via computer-generated permuted-block randomisation ( block size of four to eight ) to receive induction of labour within @ days between @ ( +@ ) weeks and @ ( +@ ) weeks of gestation , or expectant management .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by centre .
METHODS	Participants and caregivers were not masked to group assignment .
METHODS	Our primary outcome was a composite of clinically significant shoulder dystocia , fracture of the clavicle , brachial plexus injury , intracranial haemorrhage , or death .
METHODS	We did analyses by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned @ women to the induction group and @ women to the expectant management group , of whom @ women and @ women , respectively , were included in the final analysis .
RESULTS	Mean birthweight was @ g ( SD @ ) in the induction group and @ g ( @ ) in the expectant group .
RESULTS	Induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia or associated morbidity ( n = @ ) compared with expectant management ( n = @ ; relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	We recorded no brachial plexus injuries , intracranial haemorrhages , or perinatal deaths .
RESULTS	The likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery was higher in women in the induction group than in those in the expectant management group ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Caesarean delivery and neonatal morbidity did not differ significantly between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Induction of labour for suspected large-for-date fetuses is associated with a reduced risk of shoulder dystocia and associated morbidity compared with expectant management .
CONCLUSIONS	Induction of labour does not increase the risk of caesarean delivery and improves the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery .
CONCLUSIONS	These benefits should be balanced with the effects of early-term induction of labour .

BACKGROUND	Elevated concentrations of doxorubicin are found in eccrine sweat glands of the palms and soles .
BACKGROUND	We therefore evaluated an antiperspirant as preventive treatment for palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( hand-foot syndrome ) in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin .
METHODS	An antiperspirant containing aluminum chlorohydrate or placebo cream was applied to the left or right hand and foot in a double-blinded manner ( intra-patient randomization ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the rate of grade @ or @ palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia .
METHODS	A secondary endpoint was the patient-reported symptom burden ( tingling , numbness , pain , or skin problems ) .
METHODS	Using McNemar 's matched pairs design , @ patients were needed to detect a @ % difference between the treatment and placebo sides with a significance level of @ % and power of @ % .
RESULTS	Grade @ or @ PPE occurred in @ ( @ % ) of @ evaluable patients ; in six patients adverse effects occurred on the placebo side but not on the treatment side , whereas one patient developed palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia on the treatment side only ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Four patients developed grade @ or @ palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia on their foot on the placebo side but not on the treatment side ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the cohort with grade @ or @ palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia there was a trend towards fewer dermatologic symptomatologies with the active treatment ( P = @ ) , and no difference for other adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Using topical aluminum chlorohydrate as an antiperspirant appears to reduce the incidence of grade @ or @ palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia following pegylated liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer .

BACKGROUND	Methotrexate is the most frequently used first-line antirheumatic drug .
BACKGROUND	We report the findings of a phase @ study of monotherapy with tofacitinib , an oral Janus kinase inhibitor , as compared with methotrexate monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had not previously received methotrexate or therapeutic doses of methotrexate .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @ patients to receive @ mg or @ mg of tofacitinib twice daily or methotrexate at a dose that was incrementally increased to @ mg per week over @ weeks ; @ patients received a study drug .
METHODS	The coprimary end points at month @ were the mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score ( which ranges from @ to @ , with higher scores indicating greater structural joint damage ) and the proportion of patients with an American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) @ response ( @ % reduction in the number of both tender and swollen joints and @ % improvement in three of five other criteria : the patient 's assessment of pain , level of disability , C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate , global assessment of disease by the patient , and global assessment of disease by the physician ) .
RESULTS	Mean changes in the modified total Sharp score from baseline to month @ were significantly smaller in the tofacitinib groups than in the methotrexate group , but changes were modest in all three groups ( @ points in the @-mg tofacitinib group and < @ point in the @-mg tofacitinib group , as compared with @ points in the methotrexate group -LSB- P < @ for both comparisons -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Among the patients receiving tofacitinib , @ % in the @-mg group and @ % in the @-mg group had an ACR @ response at month @ , as compared with @ % of patients in the methotrexate group ( P < @ for both comparisons ) .
RESULTS	Herpes zoster developed in @ of @ patients who received tofacitinib ( @ % ) and in @ of @ patients who received methotrexate ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Confirmed cases of cancer ( including three cases of lymphoma ) developed in @ patients who received tofacitinib and in @ patient who received methotrexate .
RESULTS	Tofacitinib was associated with increases in creatinine levels and in low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients who had not previously received methotrexate or therapeutic doses of methotrexate , tofacitinib monotherapy was superior to methotrexate in reducing signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefits of tofacitinib need to be considered in the context of the risks of adverse events .

BACKGROUND	Depression is common and the efficacy of antidepressants is suboptimal .
BACKGROUND	High plasma homocysteine has been consistently associated with depression , and treatment with certain B vitamins demonstrably reduces its concentration .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether vitamins B@ , B@ and folic acid enhance response to antidepressant treatment over @ weeks .
METHODS	Randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of citalopram ( @-@ g ) together with @ mg of vitamin B@ , @ mg of folic acid and @ mg of vitamin B@ for @ weeks ( Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry : @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were community-dwelling adults aged @ years or over with DSM-IV-TR major depression .
METHODS	We measured severity of symptoms with the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode after @ , @ and @ weeks .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included reduction of MADRS scores over time and relapse of major depression after recovery by week @ .
METHODS	Results In total , @ people were randomised ( @ placebo , @ vitamins ) .
METHODS	Remission of symptoms was achieved by @ and @ % of participants treated with placebo and vitamins by week @ ( P = @ ) , by @ and @ % at week @ and @ and @ % at week @ ( effect of intervention over @ weeks : odds ratio ( OR ) = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
METHODS	Group differences in MADRS scores over time were not significant ( P = @ ) .
METHODS	The risk of subsequent relapse among those who had achieved remission of symptoms at week @ was lower in the vitamins than placebo group ( OR = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	B vitamins did not increase the @-week efficacy of antidepressant treatment , but enhanced and sustained antidepressant response over @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	Replication of these findings would mandate that treatment guidelines adopt the adjunctive use of B vitamins as a safe and inexpensive strategy to manage major depression in middle-aged and older adults .

OBJECTIVE	The Veterans Administration Cooperative Studies Program # @ , a multicenter study that randomized Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients to either subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) or globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , found that stimulation at either target provided similar overall motoric benefits .
OBJECTIVE	We conducted an additional analysis of this data set to evaluate whether PD motor subtypes responded differently to the @ stimulation targets .
METHODS	We classified @ subjects by motor subtype : tremor dominant ( TD ) , intermediate ( I ) , or postural instability gait difficulty ( PIGD ) , based on pre-DBS baseline Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) scores off-medication .
METHODS	The primary outcome was change in UPDRS part III ( UPDRS-III ) off-medication scores from baseline to @ months post-DBS , compared among subjects with particular PD motor subtypes and by DBS target ( STN vs GPi ) .
METHODS	Changes in tremor , rigidity , akinesia , and gait scores were also assessed using the UPDRS .
RESULTS	TD patients had greater mean overall motor improvement , measured by UPDRS-III , after GPi DBS , compared to STN DBS ( @ vs @ , p = @ ) , with improvement in gait accounting for this difference .
RESULTS	Regardless of stimulation target , PIGD subjects had lower mean overall improvement in UPDRS-III scores compared with I or TD subjects ( @ vs @ vs @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that responsiveness to both GPi and STN DBS is similar among different PD motor subtypes , although the TD motor subtype may have a greater response to GPi DBS with respect to gait .
CONCLUSIONS	PIGD patients obtained less overall benefit from stimulation .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the six-month outcome of three different ultrasound-guided treatments for de Quervain 's disease ( DQD ) .
METHODS	We prospectively treated @ consecutive patients ( @ females , @ males , mean age standard deviation = @ years ) with DQD .
METHODS	Patients ' features ( hand dominance , intraretinaculum septum , accessory tendons ) were recorded .
METHODS	Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , reduced disability ( quickDASH ) score , and retinaculum thickness were evaluated at baseline and after one ( excluding retinaculum thickness ) , three , and six months .
METHODS	Patients were randomized into three groups of @ patients each treated under ultrasound guidance : Group A ( @ ml methylprednisolone acetate ; mean baseline thickness = @ mm ; mean baseline VAS = @ ; mean baseline quickDASH = @ ) ; Group B ( @ ml methylprednisolone acetate +@ - day delayed @ ml saline @ % ; @ ; @ ; @ ) ; Group C ( @ ml methylprednisolone acetate +@ - day delayed @ ml low molecular weight hyaluronic acid ; @ ; @ ; @ ) .
RESULTS	After one month results were : Group A mean VAS = @ ; mean quickDASH = @ ; Group B @ ; @ ; Group C @ ; @ .
RESULTS	After three months results were : Group A retinaculum thickness = @ mm ; @ ; @ ) ; Group B @ mm ; @ ; @ ; Group C @ mm ; @ ; @ .
RESULTS	After six months results were : Group A @ mm ; @ ; @ ; Group B @ mm ; @ ; @ ; Group C @ mm ; @ ; @ ( P < @ for all vs. baseline ) .
RESULTS	Patients ' age , sex , hand dominance , presence of subcompartment dividing septum , and supernumerary tendons had no influence on outcome ( P @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of hyaluronic acid to ultrasound-guided injections of steroids to treat DQD seems to improve the outcome and to reduce the recurrence rate .
CONCLUSIONS	Ultrasound guidance allows for safe injection procedures to treat de Quervains ' disease Steroid injections allow prompt recovery in de Quervain 's disease with short-term recurrence Addition of hyaluronic acid allows recurrence rate reduction compared to simple steroid injections .

BACKGROUND	School-based mass treatment with praziquantel is the cornerstone for schistosomiasis control in school-aged children .
BACKGROUND	However , uptake of treatment among school-age children in Uganda is low in some areas .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a pre-treatment snack on uptake of mass treatment .
RESULTS	In a cluster randomized trial carried out in Jinja district , Uganda , @ primary schools were randomized into two groups ; one received education messages for schistosomiasis prevention for two months prior to mass treatment , while the other , in addition to the education messages , received a pre-treatment snack shortly before mass treatment .
RESULTS	Four weeks after mass treatment , uptake of praziquantel was assessed among a random sample of @ children in the snack schools and @ children in the non-snack schools as the primary outcome .
RESULTS	The occurrence of side effects and the prevalence and mean intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection were determined as the secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	Uptake of praziquantel was higher in the snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The occurrence of side effects was lower in the snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Prevalence and mean intensity of S. mansoni infection was lower in the snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) and @ eggs per gram of stool ( epg ) ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) ( p = @ ) and @ epg ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) ( p = @ ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that provision of a pre-treatment snack combined with education messages achieves a higher uptake compared to the education messages alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The use a pre-treatment snack was associated with reduced side effects as well as decreased prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection .

BACKGROUND	The tradeoff between stent thrombosis ( ST ) and major bleeding ( MB ) of @ - versus @-month dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) after coronary stent implantation has not been clearly defined .
METHODS	Definite/probable ST and MB ( TIMI major and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ( BARC ) @ ) were compared in @ subsequent trials with similar inclusion criteria but different DAPT duration , that is , BASKET ( @ months ; n = @ ) and BASKET-PROVE ( @ months ; n = @,@ ) , between months @ to @ ( DAPT in both trials ) , @ to @ ( DAPT in BASKET-PROVE only ) , and @ to @ ( aspirin in both trials ) using propensity score-adjusted , time-stratified Cox proportional hazard models .
RESULTS	Overall , event rates were low with fewer ST but similar MB in prolonged DAPT .
RESULTS	Analysis of the @ periods showed a uniform pattern for ST ( interaction DAPT/period ; P = @ ) but an inconsistent pattern for MB ( interaction DAPT/period ; P < @ for TIMI major and P = @ for BARC @ ) , with more MB occurring during months @ to @ with prolonged DAPT .
RESULTS	Considering observed case fatality rates of @ % with ST and @ % with MB , the extrapolated prevention of @ ST deaths and the excess of @ MB deaths resulted in an expected benefit of @ survivors/@ ,@ patients treated over @ years with prolonged DAPT .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite overall low event rates , prolonged DAPT was associated with more MB during months @ to @ according to the interaction DAPT/period .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the higher observed case fatality rates of ST versus MB , @ - versus @-month DAPT was associated with an extrapolated reduction in mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Effective treatment periods and case fatality rates seem important in the analysis of different DAPT durations , specifically with regard to ongoing trials .

BACKGROUND	Short message service ( SMS ) has been suggested as an effective method to improve adherence to medical therapy in some chronic diseases .
BACKGROUND	However , data on the effects of SMS interventions to allergic rhinitis ( AR ) treatment is limited at present .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether a daily SMS reminder could improve AR patients ' adherence to medication and treatment outcomes .
METHODS	Fifty outpatients with AR were randomized to either receive ( SMS group ) or not ( control group ) a daily SMS reminder on their cell phone to take intranasal corticosteroid treatment for @ days .
METHODS	The primary study outcomes were self-reported adherence to medication , clinic attendance rate , and severity of AR symptoms using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were changes in nasal patency ( minimum cross-sectional area , nasal cavity volume , and nasal airway resistance ) and exhaled nasal nitric oxide levels .
RESULTS	Self-reported adherence to medication in the SMS group ( @/@ , @ % ) , was significantly higher than in the control group ( @/@ , @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , the clinic attendance rate in the SMS group ( @ % ) was significantly higher than in the control group ( @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Although the VAS score improved significantly from baseline in both study groups , the improvement in the SMS group was significantly greater than in the control group ( @ @ vs. @ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between the two groups for the secondary outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	A daily SMS reminder may be an effective intervention to improve adherence to medication and treatment outcomes in AR patients .

BACKGROUND	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of @ % for children with bronchiolitis , which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections .
BACKGROUND	No evidence exists to support this threshold .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether the @ % or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic @ % or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis .
METHODS	We did a parallel-group , randomised , controlled , equivalence trial of infants aged @ weeks to @ months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK ( the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study -LSB- BIDS -RSB- ) .
METHODS	A central computer randomly allocated ( @:@ ) infants , in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification , to be clipped to standard oximeters ( patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation -LSB- SpO@ -RSB- < @ % ) or modified oximeters ( displayed a measured value of @ % as @ % , therefore oxygen not given until SpO@ < @ % ) .
METHODS	All parents , clinical staff , and outcome assessors were masked to allocation .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough ( prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus @ days ) in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ISRCTN , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Between Oct @ , and March @ , @ , and Oct @ , and March @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ infants to standard oximeters and @ infants to modified oximeters .
RESULTS	Cough resolved by @ days ( median ) in both groups ( @ % CI for difference -@ to @ ) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent .
RESULTS	We recorded @ serious adverse events in @ infants in the standard care group and @ serious adverse events in @ infants in the modified care group .
RESULTS	In the standard care group , eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit , @ were readmitted , and one had a prolonged hospital stay .
RESULTS	In the modified care group , @ infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and @ were readmitted to hospital .
RESULTS	Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly .
CONCLUSIONS	Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of @ % or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of @ % or higher .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children , particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce .

OBJECTIVE	Chronic periodontitis , a destructive inflammatory disorder of the supporting structures of the teeth , is prevalent in patients with diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	Limited evidence suggests that periodontal therapy may improve glycemic control .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if nonsurgical periodontal treatment reduces levels of glycated hemoglobin ( HbA@c ) in persons with type @ diabetes and moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis .
METHODS	The Diabetes and Periodontal Therapy Trial ( DPTT ) , a @-month , single-masked , multicenter , randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Participants had type @ diabetes , were taking stable doses of medications , had HbA@c levels between @ % and less than @ % , and untreated chronic periodontitis .
METHODS	Five hundred fourteen participants were enrolled between November @ and March @ from diabetes and dental clinics and communities affiliated with @ academic medical centers .
METHODS	The treatment group ( n = @ ) received scaling and root planing plus chlorhexidine oral rinse at baseline and supportive periodontal therapy at @ and @ months .
METHODS	The control group ( n = @ ) received no treatment for @ months .
METHODS	Difference in change in HbA@c level from baseline between groups at @ months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included changes in probing pocket depths , clinical attachment loss , bleeding on probing , gingival index , fasting glucose level , and Homeostasis Model Assessment ( HOMA@ ) score .
RESULTS	Enrollment was stopped early because of futility .
RESULTS	At @ months , mean HbA@c levels in the periodontal therapy group increased @ % ( SD , @ ) , compared with @ % ( SD , @ ) in the control group , with no significant difference between groups based on a linear regression model adjusting for clinical site ( mean difference , -@ % -LSB- @ % CI , -@ % to @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Periodontal measures improved in the treatment group compared with the control group at @ months , with adjusted between-group differences of @ mm ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) for probing depth , @ mm ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) for clinical attachment loss , @ % ( @ % CI , @ % to @ % ) for bleeding on probing , and @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) for gingival index ( P < @ for all ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Nonsurgical periodontal therapy did not improve glycemic control in patients with type @ diabetes and moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not support the use of nonsurgical periodontal treatment in patients with diabetes for the purpose of lowering levels of HbA@c .

BACKGROUND	During maneuvering , fighter pilots experience loads of up to @-@ kg on their necks .
BACKGROUND	Neck disorders are common and have been linked to impairment in muscle control .
BACKGROUND	We conducted an intervention study introducing targeted training for @ wk that reduced neck pain .
BACKGROUND	The current study reports the results of the secondary objective , which was to increase the understanding of possible mechanisms underlying such neck pain and its intervention-related relief .
METHODS	In a parallel , single-blinded , randomized controlled study , @ F-@ pilots were evaluated at baseline and randomized to a control group ( CG ; N = @ ) or training group ( TG ; N = @ ) .
METHODS	Postural control was tested in four different settings : Romberg with open and closed eyes , unilateral stance , and perturbation .
METHODS	Maximal voluntary contraction and force steadiness was measured for shoulder elevation .
RESULTS	At follow-up , there was a significant between-group difference in the Romberg test with closed eyes only ( @ % confidence ellipse area ; CG : @ + / - @ mm@ ; TG : @ + / - @ mm@ ) .
RESULTS	Prior to randomization , there were no significant differences in postural control and steadiness between @ pilots who experienced neck pain within the previous @ mo and @ pilots without such pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Impaired postural control and steadiness may only be quantifiable in individuals experiencing acute neck pain of certain intensity , and there may be a ceiling effect in the ability to improve these parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	For individuals with highly developed physiological capacity , a battery of tests with more stringent demands should be considered , e.g. , increased number of repetitions , prolonged duration of the tests , or testing with eyes closed .

OBJECTIVE	Current tobacco use treatment approaches require smokers to request treatment or depend on the provider to initiate smoking cessation care and are therefore reactive .
OBJECTIVE	Most smokers do not receive evidence-based treatments for tobacco use that include both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of a proactive , population-based tobacco cessation care model on use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments and on population-level smoking cessation rates ( ie , abstinence among all smokers including those who use and do not use treatment ) compared with usual care among a diverse population of current smokers .
METHODS	The Veterans Victory Over Tobacco Study , a pragmatic randomized clinical trial involving a population-based registry of current smokers aged @ to @ years .
METHODS	A total of @ current smokers , identified using the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) electronic medical record , were randomized prior to contact to evaluate both the reach and effectiveness of the proactive care intervention .
METHODS	Current smokers were randomized to usual care or proactive care .
METHODS	Proactive care combined ( @ ) proactive outreach and ( @ ) offer of choice of smoking cessation services ( telephone or in-person ) .
METHODS	Proactive outreach included mailed invitations followed by telephone outreach to motivate smokers to seek treatment with choice of services .
METHODS	The primary outcome was @-month prolonged smoking abstinence at @ year and was assessed by a follow-up survey among all current smokers regardless of interest in quitting or treatment utilization .
RESULTS	A total of @ participants were included in the primary analysis .
RESULTS	The follow-up survey response rate was @ % .
RESULTS	The population-level , @-month prolonged smoking abstinence rate at @ year was @ % for proactive care compared with @ % for usual care ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Logistic regression mixed model analysis showed a significant effect of the proactive care intervention on @-month prolonged abstinence ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	In analyses accounting for nonresponse using likelihood-based not-missing-at-random models , the effect of proactive care on @-month prolonged abstinence persisted ( OR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Proactive , population-based tobacco cessation care using proactive outreach to connect smokers to evidence-based telephone or in-person smoking cessation services is effective for increasing long-term population-level cessation rates .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of multimodal supervised exercise on physical functioning , falls , and related injuries in older women .
METHODS	Two-year randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Tampere , Finland .
METHODS	Women aged @ to @ who had fallen in the previous year ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group ( ClinicalTrial.gov NCT@ ) .
METHODS	Exercisers participated in group exercise classes twice a week for @ months and once a week for the subsequent @ months and home exercises .
METHODS	Controls maintained their current physical activity .
METHODS	Physical functioning assessed at baseline and at @-month intervals during the intervention .
METHODS	Falls and related injuries monitored with fall diaries .
RESULTS	Intention-to-treat analyses showed that exercise led to significant improvements in physical functioning .
RESULTS	Leg strength differed significantly between the groups ( mean change : @ % , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @ to @ in exercisers ; @ % , @ % CI = -@ to @ in controls ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Chair stand time also differed significantly between groups ( @ % , @ % CI @ to @ % in exercisers ; @ % , @ % CI = -@ to @ ) in controls ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Between-group differences were significant for fast walking speed ( P = @ ) and probability of completing the backward walking test ( P < @ ) , favoring exercisers .
RESULTS	Timed Up-and-Go and grip strength did not differ between groups .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the total falls incidence rate ratio ( IRR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ) , but exercisers were less likely to have medically attended injurious falls ( IRR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Twenty-four months of multimodal exercise enhanced physical functioning in women aged @ to @ with a history of falls .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the total number of falls was not lower than in controls , the rate of medically attended injurious falls was more than @ % lower .

BACKGROUND	In clinical practice , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are commonly discontinued after response to biologic therapy is achieved in patients with axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA ) , but the impact of NSAID discontinuation has not been assessed in prospective controlled trials .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the SPARSE study was to evaluate the effects of the anti-tumor necrosis factor agent etanercept on NSAID intake and conventional clinical outcomes in axSpA patients .
METHODS	In the double-blind , placebo-controlled period , patients with active ( mini Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) @ ) axSpA despite optimal NSAID intake were randomized to receive etanercept @mg or placebo once weekly for @weeks .
METHODS	All patients were advised to taper/discontinue their NSAID intake during the treatment period .
METHODS	NSAID intake was self-reported by diary and Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society ( ASAS ) - NSAID scores calculated based on ASAS recommendations .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week @ in ASAS-NSAID score ( analysis of covariance ) .
RESULTS	In @ randomized patients at baseline , mean age ( standard deviation ) was @ ( @ ) years ; disease duration , @ ( @ ) years ; @/@ ( @ % ) were human leukocyte antigen-B@ positive ; @/@ ( @ % ) had radiographic sacroiliitis ; and @/@ ( @ % ) were magnetic resonance imaging sacroiliitis-positive .
RESULTS	Mean ASAS-NSAID scores were similar between etanercept and placebo groups at baseline ( @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) ) , as were BASDAI ( @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) ) , and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ( @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) ) .
RESULTS	Mean changes ( SE ) in ASAS-NSAID score from baseline to week @ were -@ ( @ ) and -@ ( @ ) in the etanercept and placebo groups ( between-group difference , -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly higher proportions of patients receiving etanercept versus placebo had an ASAS-NSAID score < @ ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) and ASAS-NSAID score of @ ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) at this time point .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients in the etanercept versus placebo group achieved BASDAI@ ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) and ASAS@ ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) at week @ .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with axSpA , etanercept was associated with clinically relevant NSAID-sparing effects in addition to significant improvements in conventional clinical outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	Although the analgesic effects of corticosteroids have been well documented , little information is available on periarticular injection ( PI ) containing corticosteroids for early postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) .
OBJECTIVE	We performed a prospective double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intraoperative corticosteroid PI in patients undergoing TKA .
METHODS	Seventy-six consecutive female patients undergoing bilateral staged TKA were randomized to receive steroid or non-steroid PI , with @ months separating the procedures .
METHODS	The steroid group received PI with a mixture containing triamcinolone acetonide ( @ mg ) .
METHODS	The non-steroid group received the same injection mixture without corticosteroid .
METHODS	During the postoperative period , nighttime pain , functional recovery -LSB- straight leg raising ( SLR ) ability and maximal flexion -RSB- , patient satisfaction , and complications were recorded .
METHODS	Short-term postoperative clinical scores and patient satisfaction were evaluated at @ months .
RESULTS	The pain level was significantly lower in the PI steroid than the non-steroid group on the night of the operation ( VAS , @ vs. @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Rebound pain was observed in both groups at POD@ ( VAS , @ vs. @ ; p = @ ) , but pain remained at a low level thereafter .
RESULTS	No significant differences were seen in maximal flexion , frequency of acute rescuer , clinical scores , and patient satisfaction .
RESULTS	The steroid group was able to perform SLR earlier than the non-steroid group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of complications was similar between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	PI containing a corticosteroid provided an additional pain-relieving effect on the night of the operation .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , corticosteroid PI did not increase the perioperative complications of TKA .

OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to characterize articulation proficiency and differences between tumor sites before and after chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer with the help of acoustic measures .
OBJECTIVE	Our further goal was to improve objective speech measures and gain insight into muscle functioning before and after treatment .
METHODS	In @ patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal , nasal or nasopharyngeal , or oral or oropharyngeal cancer , we acoustically analyzed nasality , vowel space , precision , and strength of articulation in @ speech sounds ( / a / , / i / , / u / , / p / , / s / , / z / , / @ / , / t / , / tj / , / k / , / x / , / r / ) before treatment and @ weeks and @ year after treatment .
METHODS	Outcomes were compared between assessment points and between tumor sites .
RESULTS	Nasality in nonlaryngeal sites was significantly reduced by treatment .
RESULTS	Most affected in articulation were the oral or oropharyngeal cancer sites , followed by the nasal or nasopharyngeal sites .
RESULTS	One year after treatment , vowel space had not recovered and consonant articulation had weakened .
RESULTS	Laryngeal sites were less affected in articulation by tumor or treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Analyses of articulatory-acoustic features are a useful instrument for assessing articulation and speech quality objectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Assessment of a number of sounds representing various articulation manners , places , and tongue shapes revealed patterns of speech deterioration after chemoradiotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that patients ' speech could benefit from articulation exercises to address changes in muscle coordination and/or sensitivity and to counteract side effects and `` underexercise '' atrophy .

BACKGROUND	The increasing prevalence of cardiometabolic disease ( CMD ) in combination with an ageing population is a major public health problem .
BACKGROUND	Early detection and management of individuals at risk for CMD is required to prevent future health problems with associated costs .
BACKGROUND	General practice is the optimal health care setting to accomplish this goal .
BACKGROUND	Prevention programs for identification and treatment of patients with an increased risk for CMD in primary care have been proven feasible .
BACKGROUND	However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness have yet to be demonstrated .
BACKGROUND	The ` Personalized Prevention Approach for CardioMetabolic Risk ' ( PPA CMR ) is such a prevention program .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the INTEGRATE study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PPA CMR , as well as to establish determinants for participation and compliance .
METHODS	The INTEGRATE study is designed as a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with a waiting list control group .
METHODS	In approximately @ general practices , all enlisted patients without CMD aged @-@ years , are invited to participate in PPA CMR .
METHODS	After an online risk estimation , patients with a score above risk threshold are invited to the GP for additional measurements , detailed risk profiling and tailored treatment of risk factors through medication and/or lifestyle counseling .
METHODS	At baseline and after twelve months of follow-up lifestyle , health and work status of all participants are established with online questionnaires .
METHODS	Additionally after twelve months , we will determine health care utilization , costs of PPA CMR and compliance .
METHODS	Primary endpoints are the number of newly detected patients with CMD and changes in individual risk factors between the intervention and waiting list control group .
METHODS	Medical data will be extracted from the GPs ' electronic medical records .
METHODS	In order to assess factors related to participation , we will send questionnaires to non-participants and assess characteristics of participating practices .
METHODS	For all participants , additional demographic characteristics will be available through Statistics Netherlands .
CONCLUSIONS	The INTEGRATE study will provide insight into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PPA CMR as well as determinants for participation and compliance , which represents essential information to guide further large-scale implementation of primary prevention programs for CMD .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether different study-to-participant communication methods increase response , increase response from hard-to-engage individuals , and influence participants ' consent decisions .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children .
METHODS	Cohort members were invited to re-enroll at age @ and consent to linkage to their health and administrative records .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to receive one of eight combinations of three interventions : a prior-notification postcard or no contact , a standard or professionally designed consent pack , and a phone or postal reminder .
METHODS	The primary outcome was return of the consent form ( `` response '' ) , with consent decision being the secondary outcome .
RESULTS	Of @,@ participants , @ ( @ % ) responded .
RESULTS	Response rates were @ % higher ( @ % confidence interval : -@ , @ % ; P = @ ) among those receiving designed packs than among those receiving standard packs and @ % higher ( @ , @ % ; P = @ ) among those receiving phone reminders ( compared with postal reminders ) .
RESULTS	The prior-notification postcard did not influence response rates -LSB- difference = @ % ( -@ , @ % ; P = @ ) -RSB- , and we found no evidence that the communication method influenced consent decision .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial provides evidence that communication material design can influence response rates and that phone reminders have superior cost/benefit returns over designed materials .
CONCLUSIONS	Experimental evaluation of communications strategies and dissemination of findings may benefit cohort studies .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the necessity of endoscopic nasobiliary drainage ( ENBD ) catheter placement after clearance of common bile duct ( CBD ) stones .
METHODS	Patients enrolled in this study were randomly divided into two groups , according to whether or not they received ENBD after the removal of CBD stones .
METHODS	Group @ ( ENBD group ) was then subdivided into three groups : G@a patients received an endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation ( EPBD ) , G@b patients received an endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) , and G@c patients received neither .
METHODS	Group @ ( non-ENBD group ) patients were also subdivided into three groups ( G@a , G@b , and G@c ) , similar to Group @ .
METHODS	The maximum CBD diameter , the time for C-reactive protein ( CRP ) to normalize , levels of serum amylase , total serum bilirubin ( TB ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , and postoperative hospitalization duration ( PHD ) were measured .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ males , @ females ) , with an average age of @ years , were enrolled in this study .
RESULTS	One hundred and thirteen patients who received ENBD were included in Group @ , and @ patients who did not receive ENBD were included in Group @ .
RESULTS	The baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) - related complications when Groups @ and @ were compared .
RESULTS	Seventy-seven patients underwent EPBD , and @ received an ENBD tube ( G@a ) and @ did not ( G@a ) .
RESULTS	Seventy-three patients underwent EST , and @ patients received an ENBD tube ( G@b ) and @ did not ( G@b ) .
RESULTS	The remaining @ patients underwent neither EPBD nor EST ; of these patients , @ received an ENBD tube ( G@c ) and @ did not ( G@c ) .
RESULTS	For each of the three pairs of subgroups ( G@a vs G@a , G@b vs G@b , G@c vs G@c ) , there were no significant differences detected in the PHD or the time to normalization of CRP , TB and ALT .
RESULTS	In the EPBD group , the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis , hyperamylasemia and overall patient complications was significantly higher for G@a ( post-ERCP pancreatitis : @/@ vs @/@ , P = @ ; hyperamylasemia : @/@ vs @/@ , P = @ ; overall patient complications : @/@ vs @/@ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After successful CBD stone clearance , ENBD is only beneficial when an EPBD procedure has been performed .

BACKGROUND	Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease to complicate pregnancies worldwide , affecting around @ % of pregnant women in Australia .
BACKGROUND	Oxidative stress and inflammation manifest during pregnancy ; however asthma in pregnancies further intensifies oxidative stress .
BACKGROUND	Consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has been shown to be beneficial for asthma control in non-pregnant asthmatic adults .
BACKGROUND	It has not been investigated whether antioxidant-rich foods can improve the elevated oxidative stress that occurs with asthma in pregnancy , thereby improving asthma control .
BACKGROUND	The primary aim of this study is to determine whether increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods for @ weeks will improve maternal asthma control , compared to standard dietary intake during pregnancy .
METHODS	A @ week , parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted .
METHODS	One hundred and sixty eight pregnant women with mild , moderate , or severe asthma , currently using inhaled corticosteroids , and with poor diet quality , will be recruited at approximately@ weeks gestation .
METHODS	Following a @ week run-in period , women will be randomized to either a @ week antioxidant intervention ( increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods ( @ servings/day vegetables , @ servings/day fruit , @ servings/day grains ( mostly wholegrains ) , @-@ serving/week lean meat ) or standard pregnancy care .
METHODS	The primary outcome is asthma control score ( decrease of @ , the minimally clinically significant change ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include plasma antioxidants , markers of oxidative stress , and time to , and number of , exacerbations .
METHODS	With two-tailed t-tests at @ % power , a sample size of @ completions per group is required .
METHODS	Allowing for a @ % retention including a @ % removal of women from the analysis due to non-compliance , we will recruit @ women .
CONCLUSIONS	It is expected that this @ week study will improve asthma control .
CONCLUSIONS	This is significant because asthma is the most prevalent condition to complicate pregnancies and contributes to poor maternal , neonatal and infant health outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Our research will provide the first evidence to show that , in pregnancy , consumption of antioxidant-rich foods is a key modifier of clinical asthma status .
CONCLUSIONS	This research is crucial for contributing to the evidence base to inform future guidelines given existing clinical and research gaps .

BACKGROUND	Curative treatment of upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasms is complex and associated with high morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	In general , the patients are already malnourished , and early postoperative enteral nutrition is recommended .
BACKGROUND	However , there is no consensus concerning the best enteral access route in these cases .
METHODS	A prospective randomized trial was performed from @ to @ with @ patients who underwent esophagectomy , total gastrectomy , or pancreaticoduodenectomy .
METHODS	In all , @ patients declined to participate , and @ did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded .
METHODS	Of the @ included patients , @ had nasoenteric tubes , and @ had a jejunostomy .
RESULTS	The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical aspects .
RESULTS	The nasoenteric ( NE ) and jejunostomy groups underwent early enteral therapy in @ and @ % of cases ( p > @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The median length of enteral therapy use was less in the NE group ( @ vs. @ days ) , but the difference was not statistically significant .
RESULTS	The NE group required introduction of parenteral therapy more frequently than the jejunostomy group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Complications related to the enteral route occurred in @ and @ % of patients ( p > @ ) in the NE and jejunostomy groups , respectively .
RESULTS	In the NE group , there were four losses and four tube obstructions .
RESULTS	In the jejunostomy group , there were two losses , four obstructions , and two cases of leakage around the tube .
RESULTS	In the latter group , patients who underwent therapy for a longer time had tubal complications ( p < @ ) and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The two enteral routes were associated with the same number of complications .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the presence of a jejunostomy allowed enteral therapy for longer periods , especially in patients with complications , thus avoiding the need for parenteral nutrition .

BACKGROUND	To investigate the ability of the prostate genetic score ( PGS-@ ) , a germ-line biomarker of prostate cancer ( PCa ) risk , to categorize men participating in the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial .
METHODS	We obtained the genetic data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility ( CGEMS ) , a nested case control study examining germ-line DNA in the screened arm of the PLCO trial .
METHODS	A PGS-@ was calculated based on their genotype at @ PCa associated single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the diagnosis of PCa and primary predictor was PGS-@ .
RESULTS	We identified @,@ subjects ( no cancer , N = @ ) and cases ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	The PGS-@ ( P < @ ) , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ; P < @ ) , family history of PCa ( < @ ) , abnormal digital rectal exam ( DRE , P < @ ) , and history of ever smoking ( P = @ ) were associated with a PCa diagnosis .
RESULTS	In multivariable analysis , the log ( PGS-@ ) was associated with PCa diagnosis with an odds ratio of @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ , P < @ ) , log ( PSA ) ( OR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ , P < @ ) , and family history of PCa ( OR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	PGS-@ quartiles noted an increasing rate of PCa detection in addition to PSA : @ % ( Q@ ) , @ % ( Q@ ) , @ % ( Q@ ) , and @ ( Q@ ) ( P < @ ) and improvement in PSA performance ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Germ-line DNA in the form of the PGS-@ is able to risk stratify men regarding their risk of PCa .
CONCLUSIONS	The PGS-@ may have implications regarding who may benefit most from PCa screening and possibly add to PSA performance .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate and compare the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) with enamel matrix derivative ( EMD ; Emdogain ) in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis , six months after surgery .
METHODS	Forty-four ( @ ) intrabony defects in @ patients ( @ males ) were randomly allocated into two treatment groups : EMD ( n = @ ) and PRF ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Measurement of the defects was done using clinical and cone beam computed tomography at baseline and @ months .
METHODS	Clinical and radiographic parameters such as probing depth , clinical attachment level , intrabony defect depth and defect angle , were recorded at baseline and @ months post-operatively .
METHODS	Within group change was evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test .
METHODS	Intergroup comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test .
RESULTS	Postsurgical measurements revealed that there was an equal reduction in probing depth and a greater but statistically non-significant attachment gain for the Emdogain group when compared to the platelet-rich fibrin group .
RESULTS	The Emdogain group presented with significantly greater percentage defect resolution ( @ % @ ) than did the platelet-rich fibrin group ( @ % @ ) .
RESULTS	Post-operatively the changes in defect width and defect angle were significant in both groups , but upon intergroup comparison they were found to be statistically non-significantly different .
CONCLUSIONS	Both Emdogain and platelet-rich fibrin were effective in the regeneration of intrabony defects .
CONCLUSIONS	Emdogain was significantly superior in terms of percentage defect resolution .

OBJECTIVE	HM@ is a third generation P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitor currently under development .
OBJECTIVE	The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of HM@ on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of loperamide , a P-gp substrate , and to compare them with those of quinidine .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered loperamide alone ( period @ ) or with loperamide plus quinidine or HM@ in period @ or @ , respectively .
METHODS	In period @ , subjects randomly received one of three HM@ doses : @ , @ or @mg .
METHODS	Changes in pupil size , alertness , oxygen saturation and the oral bioavailability of loperamide were assessed in each period .
METHODS	In addition , the pharmacokinetics of HM@ were determined .
RESULTS	Pupil size , alertness and oxygen saturation did not change over time when loperamide alone or loperamide plus HM@ was administered while HM@ significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide , i.e. the geometric mean ratio ( @ % confidence interval ) of AUC ( @ , tlast ) for loperamide with and without HM@ was @ ( @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Co-administered quinidine significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide @-fold ( @ , @ ) , which also markedly reduced pupil size , resulting in a decrease of @ mmh in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with loperamide alone .
CONCLUSIONS	HM@ inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium , which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp , particularly in the brain , could lead to detrimental adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted to investigate adequately the dose-exposure relationship of HM@ , along with its duration of effect .

OBJECTIVE	Patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases undergo hepatic resection with curative intent .
OBJECTIVE	Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ( PET-CT ) could help avoid noncurative surgery by identifying patients with occult metastases .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of preoperative PET-CT vs no PET-CT ( control ) on the surgical management of patients with resectable metastases and to investigate the effect of PET-CT on survival and the association between the standardized uptake value ( ratio of tissue radioactivity to injected radioactivity adjusted by weight ) and survival .
METHODS	A randomized trial of patients older than @ years with colorectal cancer treated by surgery , with resectable metastases based on CT scans of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis within the previous @ days , and with a clear colonoscopy within the previous @ months was conducted between @ and @ , involving @ surgeons at @ hospitals in Ontario , Canada , with PET-CT scanners at @ academic institutions .
METHODS	Patients were randomized using a @ to @ ratio to PET-CT or control .
METHODS	The primary outcome was a change in surgical management defined as canceled hepatic surgery , more extensive hepatic surgery , or additional organ surgery based on the PET-CT .
METHODS	Survival was a secondary outcome .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who underwent PET-CT , @ had a change in surgical management ( @ % ; @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Specifically , @ patients ( @ % ) did not undergo laparotomy , @ ( @ % ) had more extensive hepatic surgery , @ ( @ % ) had additional organ surgery ( @ of whom had hepatic resection ) , and the abdominal cavity was opened in @ patient but hepatic surgery was not performed and the cavity was closed .
RESULTS	Liver resection was performed in @ % of patients in the PET-CT group and @ % of the control group .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months , the estimated mortality rate was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) events/@ person-months for the PET-CT group and @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) events/@ person-months for the control group .
RESULTS	Survival did not differ between the @ groups ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The standardized uptake value was associated with survival ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- per unit increase ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The C statistic for the model including the standardized uptake value was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) and without it was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The difference in C statistics is @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The low C statistic suggests that the standard uptake value is not a strong predictor of overall survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with potentially resectable hepatic metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma , the use of PET-CT compared with CT alone did not result in frequent change in surgical management .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings raise questions about the value of PET-CT scans in this setting .

OBJECTIVE	Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( r-tPA ) , despite a risk of early symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH ) , is of net clinical benefit to acute stroke patients .
OBJECTIVE	We tested if predictive models could identify patients least likely to be harmed by sICH or those who gained no net benefit .
METHODS	We used the Third International Stroke Trial ( IST-@ ) trial data set , an international , multicenter , open treatment randomized trial of @ mg/kg r-tPA versus control in @ patients with acute ischemic stroke .
METHODS	We compared the discrimination and calibration of previously developed predictive models for ICH and poststroke poor outcome and developed a new model using variables selected by systematic review .
METHODS	We calculated the absolute and relative risk reduction of death or dependency with r-tPA in patients at a low , medium , or high predicted risk of sICH or poor functional outcome .
RESULTS	Prediction models for sICH or poor outcome ( Hemorrhage After Thrombolysis -LSB- HAT -RSB- ; Sugar , Early Infarct Signs , Dense Artery , Age , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Stroke Score ( SEDAN ) ; Glucose Race Age Sex Pressure Stroke Severity -LSB- GRASPS -RSB- ; Stroke Thrombolytic Predictive Instrument ; Dense Artery , Rankin Score , Age , Glucose , Onset to Treatment Time , NIHSS -LSB- DRAGON -RSB- ; Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events -LSB- THRIVE -RSB- ; our new model ; and a model with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age ) had similar area under receiver operator characteristic curves ( AUROCC ) to predict sICH ( P for difference > @ ) .
RESULTS	The simplest model ( with covariates National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age ) predicted both sICH ( AUROCC , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) and poststroke poor functional outcome ( AUROCC , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) similarly to complex models .
RESULTS	There was no evidence that the effect of r-tPA in patients at high predicted risk of sICH or poor functional outcome after stroke was less than in those at lower risk .
CONCLUSIONS	There is a clinically relevant net positive effect of r-tPA in patients with acute stroke at a high predicted risk of sICH or poor functional outcome .

BACKGROUND	We sought to determine whether the design of @ different double-lumen endobronchial tubes ( DLT ) ( Rusch , Mallinckrodt , Fuji ) has an effect on the ease of placement over an airway exchange catheter ( AEC ) using a video laryngoscope .
METHODS	A convenience sample of @ anesthesia residents and fellows with at least @ years of anesthesia training was recruited from teaching hospitals in Toronto for a randomized crossover trial .
METHODS	Each participant passed each DLT over an AEC in an airway simulator , visualized and video recorded via a video laryngoscope ( GlideScope ) .
METHODS	The order of exchange was randomized by blindly pulling the name of the manufacturer of a DLT from a box .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to intubate , defined as time from the bronchial lumen entering the GlideScope view to the bronchial lumen passing the vocal cords .
METHODS	Also recorded were participants ' subjective rating of the ease of use and failure rate , defined as an attempt > @-second duration .
RESULTS	Time to intubate was faster with the Fuji-Phycon DLT ( median @ seconds ) compared with both the Rusch ( median @ seconds , P = @ ) and Mallinckrodt ( median @ seconds , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	On a scale of @ to @ , with @ being very easy to use and @ being very difficult , the Fuji-Phycon was judged to be easier to use ( median @ seconds ) compared with the Rusch ( median @ , P = @ ) and the Mallinckrodt ( median @ seconds , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The Rusch was associated with significantly more failures than the other DLTs , P = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The Fuji-Phycon DLT was easier to pass over an AEC in this simulator trial and warrants consideration in patients with difficult airways who require @-lung ventilation .

OBJECTIVE	Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) after cardiac surgery procedures is associated with poor patient outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	Cystatin C as a marker for renal failure has been shown to be of prognostic value ; however , a wide range of its predictive accuracy has been reported .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the measurement of pre - and postoperative serum cystatin C improves the prediction of AKI .
METHODS	In a single-centre , prospective study of @ patients ( @ @ ys ; range @-@ ys ; @ % male ) , cystatin C was measured six times : ( T@ = preoperative , T@ = start cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , T@ = @ min after CPB , T@ = end of operation ; T@ = @ h postoperatively ; T@ = @d postoperatively ) .
METHODS	Predictive property , in terms of the need for renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) , was analysed by receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) statistics and described by the area under the curve ( AUC ) .
RESULTS	With respect to RRT ( n = @ ) , serum cystatin C was significantly higher at the end of the operation ( T@ ) , @ h postoperatively at T@ and at T@ .
RESULTS	The AUCs for preoperative T@ and intraoperative T@/@ cystatin C were < @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The earliest significant predictive AUCs were found at the end of the operation ( T@ : p = @ @ % CI @-@ @ AUC @ ) and @ h postoperatively ( T@ : p = @ @ % CI @-@ @ AUC @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Early postoperative serum cystatin C increase appears to be a moderate biomarker in the prediction of AKI , whereas a preoperative and intraoperative cystatin C increase has only a limited diagnostic and predictive value .

METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was conducted over @ weeks , during which @ patients with T@DM completed treatment with either sitagliptin ( @mg once daily ) or placebo as add-on therapy to metformin -LSB- sitagliptin group ( n = @ ) : meanstandard error of the mean ( s.e.m. ) age @ years , means.e.m .
METHODS	HbA@c @ % ; placebo group ( n = @ ) : means.e.m .
METHODS	age : @ years , means.e.m .
METHODS	HbA@c @ % -RSB- .
METHODS	In weeks @ and @ , the patients underwent three @-h @-mM hyperglycaemic clamp experiments with infusion of either saline , GLP-@ or GIP .
METHODS	- cell function was evaluated according to first-phase , second-phase , incremental and total insulin and C-peptide responses .
RESULTS	In the sitagliptin group , the mean HbA@c concentration was significantly reduced by @ % ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The total - cell response during GIP infusion improved significantly from week @ to week @ , both within the sitagliptin group ( p = @ ) and when compared with the placebo group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The total - cell response during GLP-@ infusion was significantly higher ( p = @ ) when compared with saline and GIP infusion , but with no improvement from week @ to week @ .
RESULTS	No significant changes in - cell function occurred in the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with the DPP-@ inhibitor sitagliptin over @ weeks in patients with T@DM partially restored the lost insulinotropic effect of GIP , whereas the preserved insulinotropic effect of GLP-@ was not further improved .
CONCLUSIONS	A gradual enhancement of the insulinotropic effect of GIP , therefore , possibly contributes to the antidiabetic actions of DPP-@ inhibitors .

OBJECTIVE	Fluticasone and formoterol are effective in the treatment of asthma .
OBJECTIVE	When a corticosteroid alone fails to control asthma , combination therapy is the treatment of choice .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of formulations containing budesonide/formoterol ( BUD/FOR ) , fluticasone alone ( FLU ) , and the single-capsule combination of fluticasone/formoterol ( FLU/FOR ) on lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma .
METHODS	This was a randomized , multicenter , open phase III trial conducted in Brazil .
METHODS	The primary efficacy analysis was the assessment of non-inferiority between FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR combinations regarding FEV@ ( in L ) at the final visit .
METHODS	The secondary analyses were PEF , level of asthma control , serum cortisol levels , frequency of adverse events , adherence to treatment , and appropriate inhaler use .
RESULTS	We randomized @ patients to three groups : FLU/FOR ( n = @ ) , BUD/FOR ( n = @ ) , and FLU ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	In terms of the mean FEV@ after @ weeks of treatment , the difference between the FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR groups was @ L ( @ % CI : -@ to @ ) , whereas the difference between the FLU/FOR and FLU groups was @ L ( @ % CI : -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Non-inferiority was demonstrated by the difference between the lower limits of the two @ % CIs ( -@ vs. -@ ) .
RESULTS	The level of asthma control and PEF were significantly greater in the FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR groups than in the FLU group .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences among the groups regarding patient adherence , patient inhaler use , or safety profile of the formulations .
CONCLUSIONS	The single-capsule combination of FLU/FOR showed non-inferiority to the BUD/FOR and FLU formulations regarding efficacy and safety , making it a new treatment option for persistent asthma .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to identify the effects of a communication skills training ( CST ) program for oncologists , developed based on patient preferences regarding oncologists ' communication .
METHODS	Thirty oncologists were randomly assigned to either an intervention group ( IG ; @-day CST workshop ) or control group ( CG ) .
METHODS	Participants were assessed on their communication performance during simulated consultation and their confidence in communicating with patients at baseline and follow-up .
METHODS	A total of @,@ patients ( response rate , @ % ) who had consultations with the participating oncologists at baseline and/or follow-up were assessed regarding their distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , satisfaction with the consultation , and trust in their oncologist after the consultation .
RESULTS	At the follow-up survey , the performance scores of the IG had improved significantly , in terms of their emotional support ( P = @ ) , setting up a supportive environment ( P = @ ) , and ability to deliver information ( P = @ ) , compared with those of the CG .
RESULTS	Oncologists in the IG were rated higher at follow-up than those in the CG in terms of their confidence in themselves ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients who met with oncologists after they had undergone the CST were significantly less depressed than those who met with oncologists in the CG ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the CST program did not affect patient satisfaction with oncologists ' style of communication .
CONCLUSIONS	A CST program based on patient preferences is effective for both oncologists and patients with cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Oncologists should consider CST as an approach to enhancing their communication skills .

OBJECTIVE	Attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) is a promising novel treatment for anxiety disorders , but clinical trials have focused largely on stand-alone formats among adults .
OBJECTIVE	This randomized controlled trial examined the augmenting effects of threat-based ABMT on cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in clinically anxious youth .
METHODS	Sixty-three treatment-seeking children with anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to @ of the following @ treatment groups : ABMT + CBT ; ABMT placebo + CBT ; and CBT-alone .
METHODS	Participants in the @ ABMT conditions received repeated training on dot-probe tasks either designed to shift attention away from threats ( active ) or designed to induce no changes in attention patterns ( placebo ) .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures were frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms as determined by a clinician using a semi-structured interview .
METHODS	Self - and parent-rated anxiety measures and threat-related attention bias scores were also measured before and after treatment .
RESULTS	Both the active and placebo ABMT groups showed greater reductions in clinician-rated anxiety symptoms than the CBT-alone group .
RESULTS	Furthermore , only the active ABMT group showed significant reduction in self - or parent-rated anxiety symptoms .
RESULTS	Finally , all groups showed a shift in attention patterns across the study , starting with a bias toward threat at baseline and shifting attention away from threat after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Active and placebo ABMT might augment the clinical response to CBT for anxiety .
CONCLUSIONS	This effect could arise from benefits associated with performing computer-based paradigms such as the dot-probe task .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the absence of group differences in attention-bias changes during treatment , possible mechanisms and methodological issues underlying the observed findings are discussed .

BACKGROUND	Treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are elderly or who have comorbidities is challenging because fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapies are mostly not suitable .
BACKGROUND	Chlorambucil remains the standard of care in many countries .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to investigate whether the addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil could lead to better clinical outcomes than does treatment with chlorambucil alone , while also being tolerable for patients who have few treatment options .
METHODS	We carried out a randomised , open-label , phase @ trial for treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in @ centres in @ countries .
METHODS	We included patients who had active disease needing treatment , but in whom fludarabine-based treatment was not possible .
METHODS	We randomly assigned patients ( @:@ ) to receive oral chlorambucil ( @ mg/m ( @ ) ) on days @-@ of a @ day treatment course or to receive chlorambucil by this schedule plus intravenous ofatumumab ( cycle @ : @ mg on day @ and @ mg on day @ ; subsequent cycles : @ mg on day @ ) for three to @ cycles .
METHODS	Assignment was done with a randomisation list that was computer generated at GlaxoSmithKline , and was stratified , in a block size of two , by age , disease stage , and performance status .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and assessment was done by an independent review committee that was masked to group assignment .
METHODS	The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ patients , median age @ years ( range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Between Dec @ , @ , and May @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ patients to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab and @ patients to chlorambucil alone .
RESULTS	Median progression-free survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the group assigned to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab compared with @ months ( @-@ ) in the group assigned to chlorambucil only ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Grade @ or greater adverse events were more common in the chlorambucil plus ofatumumab group ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ; vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- given chlorambucil alone ) , with neutropenia being the most common event ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Grade @ or greater infections had similar frequency in both groups .
RESULTS	Grade @ or greater infusion-related adverse events were reported in @ ( @ % ) patients given chlorambucil plus ofatumumab .
RESULTS	Five ( @ % ) patients died during treatment in each group .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil led to clinically important improvements with a manageable side-effect profile in treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who were elderly or had comorbidities .
CONCLUSIONS	Chlorambucil plus ofatumumab is therefore an important treatment option for these patients who can not tolerate more intensive therapy .

BACKGROUND	The common bean is a staple crop in many African and Latin American countries and is the focus of biofortification initiatives .
BACKGROUND	Bean iron concentration has been doubled by selective plant breeding , but the additional iron is reported to be of low bioavailability , most likely due to high phytic acid ( PA ) concentrations .
OBJECTIVE	The present study evaluated the impact of PA on iron bioavailability from iron-biofortified beans .
METHODS	Iron absorption , based on erythrocyte incorporation of stable iron isotopes , was measured in @ Rwandese women who consumed multiple , composite bean meals with potatoes or rice in a crossover design .
METHODS	Iron absorption from meals containing biofortified beans ( @ mg Fe , @ mg PA/@ g ) and control beans ( @ mg Fe , @ mg PA/@ g ) was measured with beans containing either their native PA concentration or with beans that were @ % dephytinized or > @ % dephytinized .
RESULTS	The iron concentration of the cooked composite meals with biofortified beans was @ % higher than in the same meals with control beans .
RESULTS	With native PA concentrations , fractional iron absorption from the control bean meals was @ % , @ % higher than that from the biofortified bean meals ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The quantity of iron absorbed from the biofortified bean meals ( @ g ) was @ % higher ( P < @ ) than that from the control bean meals .
RESULTS	With @ % and > @ % dephytinization , the quantity of iron absorbed from the biofortified bean meals increased to @ and @ g , respectively , which was @ % ( P < @ ) and @ % ( P < @ ) higher than from the control bean meals .
CONCLUSIONS	PA strongly decreases iron bioavailability from iron-biofortified beans , and a high PA concentration is an important impediment to the optimal effectiveness of bean iron biofortification .
CONCLUSIONS	Plant breeders should focus on lowering the PA concentration of high-iron beans .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	The exact force systems as well as their progressions generated by removable thermoplastic appliances have not been investigated .
BACKGROUND	Thus , the purposes of this experimental study were to quantify the forces and moments delivered by a single aligner and a series of aligners ( Invisalign ; Align Technology , Santa Clara , Calif ) and to investigate the influence of attachments and power ridges on the force transfer .
METHODS	We studied @ aligners of the Invisalign system ( @ series of aligners ) .
METHODS	The aligners came from @ consecutive patients , of which @ tooth movements ( incisor torque , premolar derotation , molar distalization ) with @ movements each were analyzed .
METHODS	The @ movement groups were subdivided so that @ movements were supported with an attachment and @ were not .
METHODS	The patients ' ClinCheck ( Align Technology , Santa Clara , Calif ) was planned so that the movements to be investigated were performed in isolation in the respective quadrant .
METHODS	Resin replicas of the patients ' intraoral situation before the start of the investigated movement were taken and mounted in a biomechanical measurement system .
METHODS	An aligner was put on the model , the force systems were measured , and the calculated movements were experimentally performed until no further forces or moments were generated .
METHODS	Subsequently , the next aligners were installed , and the measurements were repeated .
RESULTS	The initial mean moments were about @ Nmm for maxillary incisor torque and about @ N for distalization .

BACKGROUND	Learners can focus on mastery ( i.e. task orientation ) or on learning relative to others ( i.e. ego orientation ) .
BACKGROUND	Previous research suggests task orientations are optimal for learning , a benefit usually linked to the suggestion that qualitative comments are better for learning than quantitative comparisons ( i.e. grades ) .
BACKGROUND	Yet , it is not clear if the observed effects are attributable to the feedback orientation ( i.e. task versus ego ) , feedback format ( i.e. comments versus numerical scores ) , or an interaction between the two .
BACKGROUND	Here , we aimed to clarify the effects of feedback orientation and feedback format during simulation-based training in endotracheal intubation .
METHODS	Forty-one medical students were randomly assigned to four feedback conditions : Task-oriented Numerical ; Ego-oriented Numerical ; Task-oriented Comment , and Ego-oriented Comment .
METHODS	Participants performed a total of @ trials of endotracheal intubation .
METHODS	Pre-test , post-test and retention test assessments included the use of hand motion analysis and a global rating scale ( GRS ) .
METHODS	Participants rated feedback credibility , self-assessment and self-confidence using Likert-type scales .
METHODS	Analyses of variance were used to examine group differences .
RESULTS	Participants ' performance did not differ significantly on the easiest ( p > @ ) or two complex variations of intubation ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	For the moderately difficult variation , analyses of hand motion and GRS data revealed significant group differences at post-test ( p < @ ) , but no differences on the retention test .
RESULTS	Analysis of participants ' perceptions showed significant interactions whereby the Ego-oriented Numerical group rated feedback credibility ( p < @ ) higher than the Task-oriented Numerical group ; the two Comment groups did not differ .
RESULTS	Some participants recounted negative experiences with the feedback they received .
CONCLUSIONS	Medical students responded to feedback in ways that challenge previous education research .
CONCLUSIONS	Specifically , students preferred and improved more in the short term ( but not at retention ) when receiving Ego-oriented feedback in Numerical form .
CONCLUSIONS	Although learning retention did not differ significantly across feedback conditions , students ' perceptions of themselves and of the teacher and training environment did differ and the implications for trainees ' future learning must be considered .

BACKGROUND	PBT@ is a metal protein-attenuating compound that might reduce metal-induced aggregation of mutant huntingtin and has prolonged survival in a mouse model of Huntington 's disease .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of PBT@ in patients with Huntington 's disease .
METHODS	In this @-week , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , adults ( @ years old ) with early-stage to mid-stage Huntington 's disease were randomly assigned ( @:@:@ ) by a centralised interactive response system to once daily PBT@ @ mg , PBT@ @ mg , or placebo .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by site with a block size of three .
METHODS	Participants , carers , the steering committee , site investigators , study staff , and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability .
METHODS	The safety population consisted of all participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one dose of study drug .
METHODS	The principal secondary endpoint was cognition , measured by the change from baseline to week @ in the main composite Z score of five cognitive tests ( Category Fluency Test , Trail Making Test Part B , Map Search , Symbol Digit Modalities Test , and Stroop Word Reading Test ) and scores on eight individual cognitive tests ( the five aforementioned plus the Trail Making Test Part A , Montreal Cognitive Assessment , and the Speeded Tapping Test ) .
METHODS	The intention-to-treat population comprised participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one efficacy assessment after administration of study drug .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between April @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , @ participants were randomly assigned to PBT@ @ mg ( n = @ ) , PBT@ @ mg ( n = @ ) , or placebo ( n = @ ) at @ research centres in Australia and the USA .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) individuals on PBT@ @ mg , @ ( @ % ) on PBT@ @ mg , and @ ( @ % ) on placebo completed the study .
RESULTS	Six serious adverse events ( acute coronary syndrome , major depression , pneumonia , suicide attempt , viral infection , and worsening of Huntington 's disease ) occurred in five participants in the PBT@ @ mg group , three ( fall with subdural haematoma , suicide attempt , and hospital admission for stabilisation of Huntington 's disease ) occurred in two participants in the PBT@ @ mg group , and one ( increasing aggression ) occurred in a participant in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The site investigators deemed all , except the worsening of Huntington 's disease , as unrelated to study drug .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) participants on PBT@ @ mg , @ ( @ % ) on PBT@ @ mg , and @ ( @ % ) on placebo had at least one adverse event .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , neither PBT@ @ mg ( least-squares mean @ , @ % CI -@ to @ ; p = @ ) nor PBT@ @ mg ( @ , -@ to @ ; p = @ ) significantly improved the main composite cognition Z score between baseline and @ weeks .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , the Trail Making Test Part B score was improved between baseline and @ weeks in the PBT@ @ mg group ( @ s , @-@ ; p = @ ) but not in the @ mg group ( @ s improvement , -@ to @ ; p = @ ) ; neither dose significantly improved cognition on the other tests .
CONCLUSIONS	PBT@ was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with Huntington 's disease .
CONCLUSIONS	The potential benefit on executive function will need to be confirmed in a larger study .

METHODS	A retrospective radiographical study .
OBJECTIVE	To construct a predictive model for pelvic tilt ( PT ) based on the sacrofemoral-pubic ( SFP ) angle in patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis secondary to ankylosing spondylitis ( or AS ) .
BACKGROUND	PT is a key pelvic parameter in the regulation of spine sagittal alignment that can be used to plan the appropriate osteotomy angle in patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis .
BACKGROUND	However , it could be difficult to measure PT in patients with femoral heads poorly visualized on lateral radiographs .
BACKGROUND	Previous studies showed that the SFP angle could be used to evaluate PT in adult patients with scoliosis .
BACKGROUND	However , this method has not been validated in patients with AS .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis were included .
METHODS	Full-length anteroposterior and lateral spine radiographs were all available , with spinal and pelvic anatomical landmarks clearly identified .
METHODS	PT , SFP angle , and global kyphosis were measured .
METHODS	The patients were randomly divided into group A ( n = @ ) and group B ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	In group A , the predictive model for PT was constructed by the results of the linear regression analysis .
METHODS	In group B , the predictive ability and accuracy of the predictive model were investigated .
RESULTS	In group A , the Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the SFP angle and PT ( r = @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The predictive model for PT was constructed as PT = @-@ @ ( SFP angle ) .
RESULTS	In group B , PT was predicted by the model with a mean error of @ ( SD = @ ) with a predictive value of @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	PT can be accurately predicted by the SFP angle using the current model : PT = @-@ @ ( SFP angle ) , when the femur heads are poorly visualized on lateral radiographs in patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis .

BACKGROUND	In type @ diabetes , acute hyperglycemia worsens endothelial function and inflammation , while resistance to GLP-@ action occurs .
BACKGROUND	All these phenomena seem to be related to the generation of oxidative stress .
BACKGROUND	A Mediterranean diet , supplemented with olive oil , increases plasma antioxidant capacity , suggesting that its implementation can have a favorable effect on the aforementioned phenomena .
BACKGROUND	In the present study , we test the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet using olive oil can counteract the effects of acute hyperglycemia and can improve the resistance of the endothelium to GLP-@ action .
METHODS	Two groups of type @ diabetic patients , each consisting of twelve subjects , participated in a randomized trial for three months , following a Mediterranean diet using olive oil or a control low-fat diet .
METHODS	Plasma antioxidant capacity , endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , @-iso-PGF@a , IL-@ and ICAM-@ levels were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study .
METHODS	The effect of GLP-@ during a hyperglycemic clamp , was also studied at baseline and at the end of the study .
RESULTS	Compared to the control diet , the Mediterranean diet increased plasma antioxidant capacity and improved basal endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , @-iso-PGF@a , IL-@ and ICAM-@ levels .
RESULTS	The Mediterranean diet also reduced the negative effects of acute hyperglycemia , induced by a hyperglycemic clamp , on endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , @-iso-PGF@a , IL-@ and ICAM-@ levels .
RESULTS	Furthermore , the Mediterranean diet improved the protective action of GLP-@ on endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , @-iso-PGF@a , IL-@ and ICAM-@ levels , also increasing GLP-@-induced insulin secretion .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that the Mediterranean diet , using olive oil , prevents the acute hyperglycemia effect on endothelial function , inflammation and oxidative stress , and improves the action of GLP-@ , which may have a favorable effect on the management of type @ diabetes , particularly for the prevention of cardiovascular disease .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of a @-month physical activity intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity among prepubertal children .
METHODS	Prepubertal children ( @ - to @-year-olds , N = @ , @ girls ) were randomly assigned to a @-month physical activity intervention or a control group .
METHODS	The intervention provided @ minutes ( @ days/week ) of moderate to vigorous physical activity .
METHODS	Maximum oxygen consumption ( Vo@max percentile ) and dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry measured cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity , respectively .
METHODS	Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to assess baseline and follow-up cardiorespiratory fitness , percentage fat mass ( % FM ) , percentage central fat mass ( % CFM ) , and estimated visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) area .
RESULTS	The intervention group increased in cardiorespiratory fitness ( @ th percentile ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ) and decreased in % FM ( -@ % ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) and % CFM ( -@ % ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) .
RESULTS	Reductions in % FM were evident for both nonoverweight ( -@ % ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) and overweight or obese ( -@ % ; @ % CI,-@ @ to -@ ) intervention participants .
RESULTS	Conversely , the control group displayed no change in cardiorespiratory fitness while exhibiting increases in % FM ( @ % ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) , % CFM ( @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) , and VAT area ( @ cm ( @ ) ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Nonoverweight control participants increased in % FM ( @ % ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) , and their overweight and obese counterparts increased in VAT ( @ cm ( @ ) ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The physical activity intervention improved cardiorespiratory fitness , reduced % FM , and prevented accumulation of % CFM among prepubertal children with varying adiposity levels .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings provide support for daily physical activity recommendations to prevent excess fat mass accumulation in childhood .

BACKGROUND	Applying a direct renin inhibitor ( DRI ) to advanced stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patients is a matter of controversy .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the DRI , aliskiren , in patients with therapy-resistant hypertension undergoing hemodialysis ( HD ) .
METHODS	The study was a prospective , randomized multicenter trial exploring the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren in comparison with amlodipine , a calcium channel blocker , in patients undergoing HD .
METHODS	A total of @ participants whose blood pressure ( BP ) had previously been treated with more than one antihypertensive agent and not having achieved the BP goal of < @/@ mmHg were randomly assigned to either aliskiren @ mg or amlodipine @ mg as an add-on therapy .
RESULTS	A significant decrease in pre-dialysis clinic BP and home BP was found only in the amlodipine group and not in the aliskiren group .
RESULTS	In contrast , there was a significant decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) in the aliskiren group but not in the amlodipine group .
RESULTS	N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic hormone remained unchanged in both groups .
RESULTS	Aliskiren significantly reduced angiotensin I and II , plasma renin activity , and increased plasma renin content .
RESULTS	However , such changes were not observed in the amlodipine group .
CONCLUSIONS	Amlodipine , not aliskiren , effectively reduces BP in CKD patients with refractory hypertension undergoing HD .
CONCLUSIONS	Aliskiren suppresses the renin-angiotensin system and reduces ANP .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether the DRI is beneficial in improving cardiovascular events in patients undergoing HD remains to be elucidated in future studies .

BACKGROUND	One of the advantages of Internet-based research is the ability to efficiently recruit large , diverse samples of international participants .
BACKGROUND	Currently , there is a dearth of information on the behind-the-scenes process to setting up successful online recruitment tools .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to examine the comparative impact of Spanish - and English-language keywords for a Google AdWords campaign to recruit pregnant women to an Internet intervention and to describe the characteristics of those who enrolled in the trial .
METHODS	Spanish - and English-language Google AdWords campaigns were created to advertise and recruit pregnant women to a Web-based randomized controlled trial for the prevention of postpartum depression , the Mothers and Babies/Mams y Bebs Internet Project .
METHODS	Search engine users who clicked on the ads in response to keyword queries ( eg , pregnancy , depression and pregnancy ) were directed to the fully automated study website .
METHODS	Data on the performance of keywords associated with each Google ad reflect Web user queries from February @ to June @ .
METHODS	Demographic information , self-reported depression symptom scores , major depressive episode status , and Internet use data were collected from enrolled participants before randomization in the intervention study .
RESULTS	The Google ads received high exposure ( @,@,@ impressions ) and interest ( @,@ clicks ) from a global sample of Web users ; @ pregnant women consented to participate and @ completed enrollment in the intervention study .
RESULTS	Keywords that were descriptive of pregnancy and distress or pregnancy and health resulted in higher consent and enrollment rates ( i.e. , high-performing ads ) .
RESULTS	In both languages , broad keywords ( eg , pregnancy ) had the highest exposure , more consented participants , and greatest cost per consent ( up to US $ @ per consent ) .
RESULTS	The online ads recruited a predominantly Spanish-speaking sample from Latin America of Mestizo racial identity .
RESULTS	The English-speaking sample was also diverse with most participants residing in regions of Asia and Africa .
RESULTS	Spanish-speaking participants were significantly more likely to be of Latino ethnic background , not married , completed fewer years of formal education , and were more likely to have accessed the Internet for depression information ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The Internet is an effective method for reaching an international sample of pregnant women interested in online interventions to manage changes in their mood during the perinatal period .
CONCLUSIONS	To increase efficiency , Internet advertisements need to be monitored and tailored to reflect the target population 's conceptualization of health issues being studied .

BACKGROUND	Abundant literature regarding the use of intravenous tranexamic acid ( TXA ) in primary total knee replacement is available .
BACKGROUND	Randomized controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of topical TXA compared with placebo , but the comparison between topical and intravenous TXA is unclear .
BACKGROUND	The present study was designed to verify noninferior efficacy and safety of topical intra-articular TXA compared with intravenous TXA in primary total knee replacement with cemented implants .
METHODS	A Phase-III , single-center , double-blind , randomized , controlled clinical trial was performed to compare topical intra-articular TXA ( @ g of TXA in @ mL of physiological saline solution ) with two intravenous doses of TXA ( @ mg/kg in @ mL of physiological saline solution , one dose before tourniquet release and another three hours after surgery ) in a multimodal protocol for blood loss prevention .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the blood transfusion rate , and the secondary outcomes included visible blood loss ( as measured in the drain ) at twenty-four hours postoperatively and invisible blood loss ( as estimated from the Nadler formula ) at forty-eight hours postoperatively .
METHODS	The sample size of seventy-eight patients was calculated to give a statistical power of @ % for demonstrating noninferiority .
METHODS	Thirty-nine patients each were allocated to receive topical intra-articular TXA ( the experimental group ) and intravenous TXA ( the control group ) ; there were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative laboratory values between the groups .
METHODS	Noninferiority was estimated by comparing the confidence intervals with a delta of @ % .
METHODS	Student t and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess the significance of any differences .
RESULTS	The transfusion rate was zero in both groups ; thus , noninferiority was demonstrated for the primary efficacy end point , suggesting equivalence .
RESULTS	Noninferiority was also demonstrated for the secondary efficacy end points .
RESULTS	Drain blood loss at twenty-four hours was @ mL ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ mL ) in the experimental group and @ mL ( @ % CI , @ to @ mL ) in the control group ( p = @ , Mann-Whitney ) .
RESULTS	Also , estimated blood loss at forty-eight hours was @ mL ( @ % CI , @ to @ mL ) in the experimental group and @ mL ( @ % CI , @ to @ mL ) in the control group ( p = @ , Mann-Whitney ) .
RESULTS	No significant safety differences were seen between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical administration of TXA according to the described protocol demonstrated noninferiority compared with intravenous TXA , with no safety concerns .

BACKGROUND	The traditional oxygen delivery methods for oxygen therapy are continuous flow oxygen ( CFO ) and demand oxygen delivery ( DOD ) ; however , oxygen waste is considerable in CFO , while DOD is uncomfortable for patients .
BACKGROUND	Synchronized DOD ( SDOD ) , which was designed to overcome the drawbacks of both CFO and DOD , supplies oxygen according to the patient 's breathing pattern and the desired oxygen saving .
BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to examine the overall performance of SDOD in terms of oxygen saturation ( SpO@ ) , patients ' comfort , and oxygen saving ratio ( SR ) .
METHODS	Study subjects were patients who required oxygen for COPD or pneumonia .
METHODS	Patients received oxygen through nasal prongs by CFO and SDOD for @ min each .
METHODS	SpO@ was measured every @ min by pulse oximetry , and subjects recorded their level of comfort after @ min .
METHODS	The flow of discharged oxygen was recorded to calculate SR. .
RESULTS	Ten subjects ( median age , @ y ; range , @-@ y ) were enrolled .
RESULTS	The SpO@ of patients during SDOD ( @ @ % ) was similar to that during CFO ( @ @ % ) with no statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Subjects reported SDOD to be more comfortable than CFO .
RESULTS	The comfort score of subjects treated with SDOD was @ @ ( @ : very uncomfortable , @ : very comfortable ) ; this was significantly higher ( P = @ ) than the comfort score ( @ @ ) of subjects treated with CFO .
RESULTS	The SR values set by clinicians were very similar to calculated SR values .
CONCLUSIONS	SDOD appears to be more suitable for oxygen therapy than CFO when considering SpO@ , patients ' comfort , and SR. .

OBJECTIVE	The objectives of the study were to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ( SAFIRE ) for detecting hepatic metastasis and to estimate the potential radiation dose reduction at abdominal computed tomography ( CT ) .
METHODS	Fifty-nine consecutive patients ( mean age , @ years ; range , @-@ years ) who had hepatic metastasis and who underwent dual-source abdominal CT were enrolled in this study .
METHODS	The image noise of the liver was compared between full-dose filtered back projection images ( FD-FBP ) and simulated half-dose images , which used only single-source projection data , and reconstructed with different strengths of SAFIRE ( HD-SAFIRE ( @-@ ) ) by @-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction .
METHODS	The diagnostic performance for hepatic metastasis was compared by logistic regression with the weighted least squares method and noninferiority test between the FD-FBP images and the half-dose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ( HD-SAFIRE ) images .
RESULTS	As the SAFIRE strength increased , image noise decreased ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The images of HD-SAFIRE ( @ ) showed similar image noise for liver parenchyma ( @ Hounsfield unit -LSB- HU -RSB- ) , signal-to-noise ratio for liver parenchyma ( @ ) , and lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio ( @ ) , compared with the FD-FBP images ( @ HU , P = @ ; @ , P > @ ; and @ , P > @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The diagnostic accuracy for hepatic metastasis with the HD-SAFIRE ( @ ) images ( @ % ) was not different from that of the FD-FBP images ( @ % , P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The diagnostic performance of the HD-SAFIRE ( @ ) images was also noninferior to that of the FD-FBP images ( @ % confidence interval lower limit difference -LSB- -@ % -RSB- excluding the -@ % clinical noninferiority limit ) .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) volume CT dose index of FD-FBP was @ ( @ ) mGy , and the mean ( SD ) radiation dose equivalent associated with HD-SAFIRE was estimated to be @ ( @ ) mGy .
CONCLUSIONS	By applying SAFIRE@ , the radiation dose could be reduced by up to @ % compared with the standard-of-care abdominal CT protocol without increasing image noise and without deteriorating diagnostic performance for the detection of hepatic metastasis .

BACKGROUND	Hemolysis reaction is a rare class effect of therapy with intravenously administered human normal immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) .
BACKGROUND	Anti-A/B isoagglutinins ( isohemagglutinins ) originating from donor plasma are considered a probable risk factor for hemolysis .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that screening and exclusion of plasma obtained from donors with high isoagglutinin titers from the manufacturing process would produce a meaningful reduction of anti-A/B isoagglutinin titers of the final IVIG product .
METHODS	A donor screening method for anti-A isoagglutinins using an automated indirect agglutination test ( IAT ) in gel cards was developed .
METHODS	Industry-scale donor plasma pools and final IVIG product were prepared according to the manufacturing process of Privigen ( human @ % liquid IVIG ) .
METHODS	Anti-A/B isoagglutinin levels were measured by IAT , direct agglutination test , and a flow cytometry-based assay .
RESULTS	Screening of plasma from @ randomly selected donors identified @ % donors with high anti-A isoagglutinin titers in plasma .
RESULTS	Exclusion of plasma from these donors resulted in a one-titer-step reduction of anti-A isoagglutinin in laboratory-scale pooled plasma .
RESULTS	The same donor screening method applied to industry-scale production resulted in exclusion of @ % of donors and produced a one-titer-step reduction of both anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin titers in the final IVIG product .
CONCLUSIONS	Anti-A/B isoagglutinin titers in IVIG products can be reduced on an industrial scale through implementation of anti-A donor screening , which may lower the risk of hemolysis after IVIG therapy .

OBJECTIVE	Polycystic liver disease ( PLD ) , the most common extrarenal manifestation of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) , has become more prevalent as a result of increased life expectancy , improved renal survival , reduced cardiovascular mortality , and renal replacement therapy .
OBJECTIVE	No studies have fully characterized PLD in large cohorts .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether liver and cyst volumes are associated with volume of the hepatic parenchyma , results from liver laboratory tests , and patient-reported outcomes .
METHODS	We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline liver volumes , measured by magnetic resonance imaging , and their association with demographics , results from liver laboratory and other tests , and quality of life .
METHODS	The data were collected from a randomized , placebo-controlled trial underway at @ tertiary-care medical centers to determine whether the combination of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II-receptor blocker was superior to the inhibitor alone , and whether low blood pressure ( < @/@ mm Hg ) was superior to standard blood pressure ( @-@/@ -@ mm Hg ) , in delaying renal cystic progression in @ patients with ADPKD , stages @ and @ chronic kidney disease , and hypertension ( age , @-@ y ) .
RESULTS	We found hepatomegaly to be common among patients with ADPKD .
RESULTS	Cysts and parenchyma contributed to hepatomegaly .
RESULTS	Cysts were more common and liver and cyst volumes were greater in women , increasing with age .
RESULTS	Patients with advanced disease had a relative loss of liver parenchyma .
RESULTS	We observed small abnormalities in results from liver laboratory tests , and that splenomegaly and hypersplenism were associated with PLD severity .
RESULTS	Higher liver volumes were associated with a lower quality of life .
CONCLUSIONS	Hepatomegaly is common even in early stage ADPKD and is not accounted for by cysts alone .
CONCLUSIONS	Parenchymal volumes were larger , compared with liver volumes of patients without ADPKD or with those predicted by standardized equations , even among patients without cysts .
CONCLUSIONS	The severity of PLD was associated with altered biochemical and hematologic features , as well as quality of life .

BACKGROUND	It is projected that in Australia there will be between @ % and @ % of palliative care patients living alone by the year @ .
BACKGROUND	As such , it will become increasingly important to provide appropriate home-based care in order to support these patients to be cared for and die at home .
OBJECTIVE	This study explored the experiences of community-based palliative care cancer patients who live alone without a caregiver and what psychosocial issues they face .
METHODS	Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted with eight participants , and constant comparison was used for the analysis .
RESULTS	Four main themes emerged : ( @ ) loss of social networks ; ( @ ) maintaining independence ; ( @ ) balancing independence and the need for assistance ; and ( @ ) planning for the end of life .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants balanced independence with the need to accept help in order to maintain independence .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants became more flexible about their preferred place of death .
CONCLUSIONS	The practice implications for working with people close to death who are living alone are that supports and assistance may be needed to maintain social networks and also a sense of independence .

BACKGROUND	The timely publication of findings in peer-reviewed journals is a primary goal of clinical research .
BACKGROUND	In clinical trials , the processes leading to publication can be complex from choice and prioritization of analytic topics through to journal submission and revisions .
BACKGROUND	As little literature exists on the publication process for multicenter trials , we describe the development , implementation , and effectiveness of such a process in a multicenter trial .
METHODS	The Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis ( HALT-C ) trial included a data coordinating center ( DCC ) and clinical centers that recruited and followed more than @,@ patients .
METHODS	Publication guidelines were approved by the steering committee , and the publications committee monitored the publication process from selection of topics to publication .
RESULTS	A total of @ manuscripts were published in @ peer-reviewed journals .
RESULTS	When manuscripts were closely tracked , the median time for analyses and drafting of manuscripts was @months .
RESULTS	The median time for data analyses was @months and the median time for manuscript drafting was @months .
RESULTS	The median time for publications committee review , submission , and journal acceptance was @months , and the median time from analytic start to journal acceptance was @months .
CONCLUSIONS	Effective publication guidelines must be comprehensive , implemented early in a trial , and require active management by study investigators .
CONCLUSIONS	Successful collaboration , such as in the HALT-C trial , can serve as a model for others involved in multidisciplinary and multicenter research programs .

BACKGROUND	Several evidences have supported the benefits of home blood pressure monitoring ( HBPM ) in improving hypertension awareness and control .
BACKGROUND	However , little was known about the use of HBPM by hypertensive patients in primary care in China .
METHODS	A cross-sectional questionnaire survey on HBPM use was conducted on @ hypertensive patients in Xinzhuang County Hospital in Shanghai , and the factors related to regular use of HBPM were also determined .
RESULTS	Overall , @ of the @ participants engaged in using HBPM , among whom @ individuals used HBPM more than once a month .
RESULTS	Of the @ HBPM users , @ % chose a mercury sphygmomanometer , @ % used wrist-cuff electronic devices , and @ % selected arm-cuff electronic devices .
RESULTS	In addition , @ % of HBPM users reported HBP readings to their general practitioners .
RESULTS	Compared with the less frequent users , patients who used HBPM daily were likely to report their blood pressure ( BP ) values to the doctors depending on notebook or mechanical memory than on their own memories ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , patients with college education were @ times more likely than those with middle school education or less to engage in frequent HBPM use ( odds ratio = @ , @ % confidence interval = @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This local community survey showed that @ % of hypertension patients used HBPM frequently in primary care in China .
CONCLUSIONS	However , certain patients chose the improper BP monitoring device or questionable reporting methods .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the use of arm-cuff electric devices with multiple memory storage or a home BP telemonitoring system should be promoted by health education targeted at hypertensive patients .

BACKGROUND	Use of rehabilitation technology , such as ( electro ) mechanical devices or robotics , could partly relieve the increasing strain on stroke rehabilitation caused by an increasing prevalence of stroke .
BACKGROUND	Arm support ( AS ) training showed improvement of unsupported arm function in chronic stroke .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the effect of weight-supported arm training combined with computerized exercises on arm function and capacity , compared with dose-matched conventional reach training in subacute stroke patients .
METHODS	In a single-blind , multicenter , randomized controlled trial , @ subacute stroke patients received @ weeks of training with either an AS device combined with computerized exercises or dose-matched conventional training ( CON ) .
METHODS	Arm function was evaluated pretraining and posttraining by Fugl-Meyer assessment ( FM ) , maximal reach distance , Stroke Upper Limb Capacity Scale ( SULCS ) , and arm pain via Visual Analogue Scale , in addition to perceived motivation by Intrinsic Motivation Inventory posttraining .
RESULTS	FM and SULCS scores and reach distance improved significantly within both groups .
RESULTS	These improvements and experienced pain did not differ between groups .
RESULTS	The AS group reported higher interest/enjoyment during training than the CON group .
CONCLUSIONS	AS training with computerized exercises is as effective as conventional therapy dedicated to the arm to improve arm function and activity in subacute stroke rehabilitation , when applied at the same dose .

BACKGROUND	Rates of retention in care of HIV-positive pregnant women in care programs in Nigeria remain generally poor with rates around @ % reported for specific programs .
BACKGROUND	Poor quality of services in health facilities and long waiting times are among the critical factors militating against retention of these women in care .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the interventions in this study is to assess whether a continuous quality improvement intervention using a Breakthrough Series approach in local district hospitals and primary health care clinics will lead to improved retention of HIV-positive women and mothers .
METHODS	A cluster randomized controlled trial with @ health facilities randomized to receive a continuous quality improvement/Breakthrough Series intervention or not .
METHODS	The care protocol for HIV-infected pregnant women and mothers is the same in all sites .
METHODS	The quality improvement intervention started @ months before enrollment of individual HIV-infected pregnant women and initially focused on reducing waiting times for women and also ensuring that antiretroviral drugs are dispensed on the same day as clinic attendance .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure is retention of HIV-positive mothers in care at @ months postpartum .
CONCLUSIONS	Results of this trial will inform whether quality improvement interventions are an effective means of improving retention in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs and will also guide where health system interventions should focus to improve the quality of care for HIV-positive women .
CONCLUSIONS	This will benefit policymakers and program managers as they seek to improve retention rates in HIV care programs .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether the negative quality of life result of a large randomized exercise intervention study ( BREX ) was due to considerable spontaneous recovery after adjuvant treatments .
METHODS	The change in QoL was studied in the control patients of the BREX study ( Group @ ) and a group of similar follow-up patients that did not participate in any intervention study ( Group @ ) .
METHODS	QoL was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C@ with the breast cancer module supplement @ and @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	QoL improved in both groups between @ and @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	The improvement was similar in both groups for global QoL and for most of the QoL sub-scales .
CONCLUSIONS	No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that participation in an exercise intervention per se significantly improves QoL .
CONCLUSIONS	Spontaneous improvement in QoL began during the first six months after the primary treatments , which might have confounded the results of the intervention of the BREX study .

OBJECTIVE	Prediction of radiographic progression ( RP ) in early rheumatoid arthritis ( eRA ) would be very useful for optimal choice among available therapies .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated a multi-biomarker disease activity ( MBDA ) score , based on @ serum biomarkers as a baseline predictor for @-year RP in eRA .
METHODS	Baseline disease activity score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS@-ESR ) , disease activity score based on C-reactive protein ( DAS@-CRP ) , CRP , MBDA scores and DAS@-ESR at @months were analysed for @ patients with eRA from the Swedish Farmacotherapy ( SWEFOT ) clinical trial .
METHODS	RP was defined as an increase in the Van der Heijde-modified Sharp score by more than five points over @year .
METHODS	Associations between baseline disease activity measures , the MBDA score , and @-year RP were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression , adjusted for potential confounders .
RESULTS	Among @ patients with eRA , @ had low and @ moderate MBDA scores at baseline .
RESULTS	None of the former and only one of the latter group ( @ % ) had RP during @year , while the proportion of patients with RP among those with high MBDA score was @ % ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among patients with low/moderate CRP , moderate DAS@-CRP or moderate DAS@-ESR at baseline , progression occurred in @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	MBDA score was an independent predictor of RP as a continuous ( OR = @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) and dichotomised variable ( high versus low/moderate , OR = @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with eRA , the MBDA score at baseline was a strong independent predictor of @-year RP .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that when choosing initial treatment in eRA the MBDA test may be clinically useful to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of RP .

BACKGROUND	Results of an exploratory phase @ study showed that insulin degludec , a basal insulin with an action profile of longer than @ h , provided similar glycaemic control when injected three times a week ( IDeg @TW ) to once-daily insulin glargine ( IGlar OD ) .
BACKGROUND	To provide further evidence , we did two phase @ trials to compare the efficacy and safety of IDeg @TW with IGlar OD in insulin-naive patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	In two @ week , randomised , open-label , parallel group , non-inferiority trials IDeg was injected Monday , Wednesday , and Friday before breakfast ( IDeg @TW ( AM ) ) in the AM trial ( @ sites in seven countries ) or with the evening meal ( IDeg @TW ( PM ) ) in the PM trial ( @ sites in seven countries ) , and compared with IGlar OD .
METHODS	Adults with type @ diabetes ( HbA ( @c ) @-@ @ % ; body-mass index @ kg/m ( @ ) ) were randomly allocated ( @:@ ) without stratification by a central interactive response system to IDeg @TW or IGlar OD .
METHODS	Both groups continued taking metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase-@ inhibitors .
METHODS	Insulin was titrated to achieve a prebreakfast self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) concentration of between @ and less than @ mmol/L .
METHODS	The primary outcome was non-inferiority of IDeg @TW compared with IGlar OD , as assessed by change in HbA ( @c ) from baseline to @ weeks ( non-inferiority limit of @ % ) by ANOVA in an intent-to-treat analysis ( full analysis set ) .
METHODS	These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , numbers NCT@ and NCT@ .
RESULTS	We recruited @ patients for the AM trial ( IDeg @TW ( AM ) , n = @ ; IGlar OD , n = @ ) and @ patients for the PM trial ( IDeg @TW ( PM ) , n = @ ; IGlar OD , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	After @ weeks , mean HbA decreased by @ % ( IDeg @TW ( AM ) ) and @ % ( IGlar OD ) in the AM trial , and by @ % ( IDeg @TW ( PM ) ) and @ % ( IGlar OD ) in the PM trial .
RESULTS	Non-inferiority was not confirmed in either trial ( estimated treatment difference -LSB- IDeg @TW ( AM ) - IGlar OD -RSB- @ % , @ % CI @-@ @ ; -LSB- IDeg @TW ( PM ) - IGlar OD -RSB- @ % , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Across the two trials , rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia ( SMBG < @ mmol/L or severe -LSB- needing assistance -RSB- ) ranged from @ to @ episodes per patient-year and were similar for IDeg @TW ( AM ) and IGlar OD ( estimated rate ratio -LSB- ERR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , but higher for IDeg @TW ( PM ) than for IGlar OD ( ERR @ , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was higher for IDeg @TW ( AM ) than for IGlar OD ( ERR @ , @-@ @ ) ; we noted no significant difference between IDeg @TW ( PM ) and IGlar OD ( ERR @ , @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The inferior glycaemic control and increased risk of hypoglycaemia with IDeg @TW compared with IGlar OD do not support a three-times-weekly dosing regimen .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of two office-based treatments designed to prevent deterioration in glycemic control in young adolescents with type @ diabetes in a randomized clinical trial .
OBJECTIVE	An individualized , more intensive family teamwork Coping skills program was compared with a diabetes Education treatment .
METHODS	A baseline assessment was followed by four brief treatment sessions and immediate posttesting over the course of @ years .
METHODS	Families of @ early adolescents ( ages @-@ ) were randomized to receive either individualized coping skills education or diabetes education as adjunctive treatment to quarterly medical appointments .
METHODS	Continued follow-up occurred at @-month intervals for a long-term follow-up of up to @ years .
METHODS	A post hoc Usual Care group facilitated comparisons of glycemic control .
RESULTS	Growth curve analysis showed that both treatment groups successfully prevented deterioration in adolescent disease care and simultaneously improved adolescent and parent quality of life that included indicators of more effective communication and reduced adherence barriers-without a concomitant increase in diabetes-related or general family conflict .
RESULTS	However , contrary to expectation , the Education group was more efficacious than the Coping group in improvement of disease adherence and glycemic control over a @-year follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	Low-intensity office-based quarterly treatment can maintain or improve disease care adherence in early adolescence when provided to adolescent/parent dyads .
CONCLUSIONS	Better outcomes are achieved when treatment goals and techniques match the needs of the targeted population .

BACKGROUND	Indomethacin is a potent analgesic that , similar to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , is associated with serious dose-related adverse events .
BACKGROUND	There is a need for newer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products with improved tolerability .
BACKGROUND	Low-dose submicron indomethacin was developed using SoluMatrix Fine Particle Technology to enable treatment at lower doses than commercially available indomethacin drug products .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of submicron indomethacin @ and @ mg compared with indomethacin @-mg capsules .
METHODS	This was a phase @ , randomized , open-label , @-period , @-sequence , single-dose crossover study .
METHODS	Forty healthy volunteers received low-dose submicron indomethacin @ - or @-mg capsules , or indomethacin @-mg capsules under fasting or fed conditions .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetic parameters and safety were assessed .
RESULTS	Comparable fasting peak plasma levels ( mean standard deviation ) were demonstrated for submicron indomethacin @ mg ( @ @ ng/ml ) and indomethacin @ mg ( @ @ ng/ml ) .
RESULTS	The overall systemic exposure ( geometric least squares mean ; @ % CI ) was > @ % lower for submicron indomethacin @ mg ( @ ngh/mL ; @-@ @ ) compared with indomethacin @ mg ( @ ngh/ml ; @-@ @ ) under fasting conditions .
RESULTS	Food delayed the rate but did not affect the extent of indomethacin absorption from submicron indomethacin @ mg .
RESULTS	Submicron indomethacin @ mg administration resulted in earlier time to peak plasma levels ( median @ ; min-max @-@ @ hours ) under fasting conditions compared with indomethacin @ mg ( @ ; @-@ @ hours ) .
RESULTS	Submicron indomethacin @ and @ mg were dose proportional and generally well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with indomethacin @ mg , submicron indomethacin @ mg achieved similar peak plasma concentrations , lower systemic exposure , and a faster time to peak plasma concentration , indicating rapid absorption .
CONCLUSIONS	The current formulation of low-dose submicron indomethacin has recently demonstrated efficacy in @ phase @ studies in patients with acute pain following bunionectomy and represents a new , low-dose treatment option for patients with acute pain .

BACKGROUND	Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) have been shown to predict reduced survival outcomes in metastatic breast cancer .
METHODS	CTCs were analyzed in @ patients with early breast cancer before adjuvant chemotherapy and in @ patients after chemotherapy using the CellSearch System .
METHODS	After immuno-magnetic enrichment for cells expressing the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule , CTCs were defined as nucleated cells expressing cytokeratin and lacking CD@ .
METHODS	The patients were followed for a median of @ months ( range = @-@ ) .
METHODS	Kaplan-Meier analyses and the log-rank test were used for survival analyses .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	Before chemotherapy , CTCs were detected in @ % of patients ( n = @ of @ ) , with @ % ( n = @ of @ ) of node-negative and @ % ( n = @ of @ ) of node-positive patients showing CTCs ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No association was found with tumor size , grading , or hormone receptor status .
RESULTS	After chemotherapy , @ % of patients ( n = @ of @ ) were CTC positive .
RESULTS	The presence of CTCs was associated with poor disease-free survival ( DFS ; P < @ ) , distant DFS ( P < @ ) , breast cancer-specific survival ( P = @ ) , and overall survival ( OS ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	CTCs were confirmed as independent prognostic markers in multivariable analysis for DFS ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- = @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ to @ ; P < @ ) and OS ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The prognosis was worst in patients with at least five CTCs per @ mL blood ( DFS : HR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ; OS : HR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The presence of persisting CTCs after chemotherapy showed a negative influence on DFS ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) and on OS ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest the independent prognostic relevance of CTCs both before and after adjuvant chemotherapy in a large prospective trial of patients with primary breast cancer .

OBJECTIVE	Reduction of cardiovascular risk with high consumption of fish in diet is still a matter of debate , and concerns about heavy metal contamination have limited consumption of oily fish .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to evaluate the effect of regular ingestion of white fish on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome .
RESULTS	Multicenter randomized crossover clinical trial including @ individuals with metabolic syndrome .
RESULTS	An @-week only-one dietary intervention : @ g/d of white fish ( Namibia hake ) with advice on a healthy diet , compared with no fish or seafood with advice on a healthy diet .
RESULTS	Outcomes were lipid profile , individual components of the metabolic syndrome , serum insulin concentrations , homeostasis model of insulin resistance , serum C-reactive protein and serum fatty acid levels .
RESULTS	We found a significant lowering effect of the intervention with white fish on waist circumference ( P < @ ) and diastolic blood pressure ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A significant lowering effect was also shown after the dietary intervention with fish on serum LDL concentrations ( P = @ ) , whereas no significant effects were found on serum HDL or triglyceride concentrations .
RESULTS	A significant rise ( P < @ ) in serum EPA and DHA fatty acids was observed following white fish consumption .
RESULTS	Overall adherence to the intervention was good and no adverse events were found .
CONCLUSIONS	In individuals with metabolic syndrome , regular consumption of hake reduces LDL cholesterol concentrations , waist circumference and blood pressure components of the metabolic syndrome .

BACKGROUND	Despite the popularity of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation , the efficacy of this method is unclear .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers .
METHODS	This was a cluster-randomised , parallel-group , controlled trial .
METHODS	A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers ( median size = @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were @ smokers consuming @ cigarettes per day , willing to quit and not using cessation aids ( @ % females , M = @ years -LSB- SD = @ -RSB- , @ % Swiss ) .
METHODS	Nicotine withdrawal , smoking abstinence self-efficacy , and adverse reactions were assessed at a @-week follow-up .
METHODS	The main outcome , self-reported @-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence , was assessed at a @-month follow up .
METHODS	Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day , smoking abstinence self-efficacy , and nicotine withdrawal .
RESULTS	At the @-month follow up , @ % in the hypnosis group and @ % in the relaxation group were abstinent .
RESULTS	The intervention had no effect on smoking status ( p = @ ) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions ( p = @ ) at the @-week follow-up , but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both interventions produced few adverse reactions ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A single session of group hypnotherapy does not appear to be more effective for smoking cessation than a group relaxation session .

OBJECTIVE	A review on headache and insomnia revealed that insomnia is a risk factor for increased headache frequency and headache intensity in migraineurs .
OBJECTIVE	The authors designed a randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , pilot study in which migraineurs who also had insomnia were enrolled , to test this observation .
METHODS	In the study , the authors treated @ subjects with IHS-II migraine with and/or without aura and with DSM-IV primary insomnia for @ weeks with @ mg eszopiclone ( Lunesta ( ) ) or placebo at bedtime .
METHODS	The treatment was preceded by a @-week baseline period and followed by a @-week run-out period .
RESULTS	Of the @ subjects treated , @ were evaluable , @ in the eszopiclone group , and @ in the placebo group .
RESULTS	At baseline , the groups were comparable except for sleep latency .
RESULTS	Of the three remaining sleep variables , total sleep time , nighttime awakenings , and sleep quality , the number of nighttime awakenings during the @-week treatment period was significantly lower in the eszopiclone group than in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Of the three daytime variables , alertness , fatigue , and functioning , this was also the case for fatigue ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The headache variables , frequency , duration , and intensity , did not show a difference from placebo during the @-week treatment period .
CONCLUSIONS	The study did not meet primary endpoint , that is , the difference in total sleep time during the @-week treatment period between eszopiclone and placebo was less than @ minutes .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , it failed to answer the question as to whether insomnia is , indeed , a risk factor for increased headache frequency and headache intensity in migraineurs .

BACKGROUND	Cisplatin and gemcitabine is the standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer ; expression of VEGF and its receptors is associated with adverse outcomes .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib ( an oral inhibitor of VEGF receptor @ , @ , and @ ) to cisplatin and gemcitabine on progression-free survival .
METHODS	In this multicentre , placebo-controlled , randomised phase @ study , we recruited patients aged @ years or older with histologically confirmed or cytologically confirmed advanced biliary tract cancer from hepatobiliary oncology referral centres in the UK .
METHODS	Patients were eligible if they had an ECOG performance status of @-@ and an estimated life expectancy of longer than @ months .
METHODS	Patients were given first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy ( @ mg/m ( @ ) cisplatin and @ mg/m ( @ ) gemcitabine -LSB- on days @ and @ every @ days , for up to eight cycles -RSB- ) with either @ mg oral cediranib or placebo once a day until disease progression .
METHODS	We randomly assigned patients ( @:@ ) with a minimisation algorithm , incorporating the stratification factors : extent of disease , primary disease site , previous treatment , ECOG performance status , and centre .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ , and was closed on Sept @ , @ ; results of the final analysis for the primary endpoint are presented .
RESULTS	Between April @ , @ , and Sept @ , @ , we enrolled @ patients ( @ in each group ) .
RESULTS	With a median follow-up of @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , median progression-free survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the cediranib group and @ months ( @-@ ) in the placebo group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients who received cediranib had more grade @-@ toxic effects than did patients who received placebo : hypertension ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) , diarrhoea ( eight -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs two -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) ; platelet count decreased ( ten -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs four -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) , white blood cell decreased ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs seven -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) and fatigue ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs seven -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Cediranib did not improve the progression-free survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine , which remains the standard of care .
CONCLUSIONS	Although patients in the cediranib group had more adverse events , we recorded no unexpected toxic effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The role of VEGF inhibition in addition to chemotherapy for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer remains investigational .

BACKGROUND	High blood pressure is an important public health concern because it is highly prevalent and a risk factor for adverse health outcomes , including coronary heart disease , stroke , decompensated heart failure , chronic kidney disease , and decline in cognitive function .
BACKGROUND	Observational studies show a progressive increase in risk associated with blood pressure above @/@ mm Hg .
BACKGROUND	Prior research has shown that reducing elevated systolic blood pressure lowers the risk of subsequent clinical complications from cardiovascular disease .
BACKGROUND	However , the optimal systolic blood pressure to reduce blood pressure-related adverse outcomes is unclear , and the benefit of treating to a level of systolic blood pressure well below @ mm Hg has not been proven in a large , definitive clinical trial .
OBJECTIVE	To describe the design considerations of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ) and the baseline characteristics of trial participants .
METHODS	The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial is a multicenter , randomized , controlled trial that compares two strategies for treating systolic blood pressure : one targets the standard target of < @ mm Hg , and the other targets a more intensive target of < @ mm Hg .
METHODS	Enrollment focused on volunteers of age @ years ( no upper limit ) with an average baseline systolic blood pressure @ mm Hg and evidence of cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease , @-year Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score @ % , or age @ years .
METHODS	The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruitment also targeted three pre-specified subgroups : participants with chronic kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < @ mL/min/@ @ m ( @ ) ) , participants with a history of cardiovascular disease , and participants @ years of age or older .
METHODS	The primary outcome is first the occurrence of a myocardial infarction ( MI ) , acute coronary syndrome , stroke , heart failure , or cardiovascular disease death .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality , decline in kidney function or development of end-stage renal disease , incident dementia , decline in cognitive function , and small-vessel cerebral ischemic disease .
RESULTS	Between @ November @ and @ March @ , Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruited and randomized @ people at @ clinics , including @ women , @ with chronic kidney disease , @ with a history of cardiovascular disease , @ minorities , and @ @ years of age .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the overall recruitment target was met , the numbers recruited in the high-risk subgroups were lower than planned .
CONCLUSIONS	The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial will provide important information on the risks and benefits of intensive blood pressure treatment targets in a diverse sample of high-risk participants , including those with prior cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease , and those aged @ years .

BACKGROUND	Animal studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in neurocognitive function and the response to antihypertensive therapy .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the impact of circulating aldosterone and renin activity on cognition and cerebral hemodynamics at baseline and after antihypertensive therapy for @ year .
METHODS	Participants were older adults ( n = @ ; mean age = @ years ) enrolled in a clinical trial .
METHODS	Routine antihypertensive medications were replaced with the study regimen to achieve a blood pressure < @/@ mm Hg .
METHODS	Executive function , memory , cerebral hemodynamics ( blood flow velocity ) , CO@ vasoreactivity ( measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography ) , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone were measured at baseline and at @ and @ months after the initiation of treatment .
RESULTS	At baseline , higher levels of circulating aldosterone were associated with lower blood flow velocity ( = -@ ; P = @ ) , lower CO@ vasoreactivity ( = -@ ; P = @ ) , and decreased autoregulation abilities ( = -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Those with higher levels of aldosterone at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvement in executive function ( P = @ for the aldosterone effect ) and in CO@ vasoreactivity ( P = @ for the aldosterone effect ) after @ months of lowering blood pressure ( < @/@ mm Hg ) .
RESULTS	Plasma renin activity was not associated with any of the measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher levels of aldosterone may be associated with decreased cerebrovascular function in hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	Those with higher aldosterone levels may benefit the most from lowering blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	The role of aldosterone in brain health warrants further investigation in a larger trial .

BACKGROUND	The standard of care for operable , stage I , non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling .
BACKGROUND	Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) for inoperable stage I NSCLC has shown promising results , but two independent , randomised , phase @ trials of SABR in patients with operable stage I NSCLC ( STARS and ROSEL ) closed early due to slow accrual .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess overall survival for SABR versus surgery by pooling data from these trials .
METHODS	Eligible patients in the STARS and ROSEL studies were those with clinical T@-@a ( < @ cm ) , N@M@ , operable NSCLC .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to SABR or lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling .
METHODS	We did a pooled analysis in the intention-to-treat population using overall survival as the primary endpoint .
METHODS	Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( STARS : NCT@ ; ROSEL : NCT@ ) .
RESULTS	@ patients were enrolled and randomly assigned ( @ to SABR and @ to surgery ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) for the SABR group and @ months ( @-@ ) for the surgery group .
RESULTS	Six patients in the surgery group died compared with one patient in the SABR group .
RESULTS	Estimated overall survival at @ years was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the SABR group compared with @ % ( @-@ ) in the surgery group ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , log-rank p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Recurrence-free survival at @ years was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the SABR group and @ % ( @-@ ) in the surgery group ( HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , log-rank p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the surgery group , one patient had regional nodal recurrence and two had distant metastases ; in the SABR group , one patient had local recurrence , four had regional nodal recurrence , and one had distant metastases .
RESULTS	Three ( @ % ) patients in the SABR group had grade @ treatment-related adverse events ( three -LSB- @ % -RSB- chest wall pain , two -LSB- @ % -RSB- dyspnoea or cough , and one -LSB- @ % -RSB- fatigue and rib fracture ) .
RESULTS	No patients given SABR had grade @ events or treatment-related death .
RESULTS	In the surgery group , one ( @ % ) patient died of surgical complications and @ ( @ % ) patients had grade @-@ treatment-related adverse events .
RESULTS	Grade @ events occurring in more than one patient in the surgery group were dyspnoea ( four -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) , chest pain ( four -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) , and lung infections ( two -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	SABR could be an option for treating operable stage I NSCLC .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of the small patient sample size and short follow-up , additional randomised studies comparing SABR with surgery in operable patients are warranted .

BACKGROUND	Major depression is a serious mental disorder that causes substantial distress and impairment in individuals and places an enormous burden on society .
BACKGROUND	Although antidepressant treatment is the most common therapy provided in routine practice , there is little evidence to guide second-line therapy for patients who have failed to respond to antidepressants .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial that measures the clinical effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) as an augmentation strategy to treat patients with non-psychotic major depression identified as suboptimal responders to usual depression care .
METHODS	The current study is a @-week assessor-blinded randomised , parallel-groups superiority trial with @-month follow-up at an outpatient clinic as part of usual depression care .
METHODS	Patients aged @-@years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) Major Depressive Disorder who have experienced at least one failed trial of antidepressants as part of usual depression care , will be randomly assigned to receive CBT plus treatment as usual , or treatment as usual alone .

OBJECTIVE	The enigmatic etiology of neurodegenerative diseases poses a challenge for the development of novel and efficient drugs .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a polyherbal ( test ) formulation on cognitive functions , inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in healthy elderly as well as senile dementia of Alzheimer 's type ( SDAT ) patients .
METHODS	A randomized double-blind placebo - and active-controlled clinical trial was performed in healthy elderly subjects and SDAT patients with an age range of @-@ years .
METHODS	The polyherbal test formulation along with a placebo was given to healthy elderly subjects while the SDAT patients received either the test formulation containing extracts of Bacopa monnieri ( whole plant ) , Hippophae rhamnoides ( leaves and fruits ) and Dioscorea bulbifera ( bulbils ) at a dose of @ mg or donepezil drug ( Aricept ) at a dose of @ mg , twice daily , for a period of @ months .
METHODS	After every three months , cognitive functions were assessed by determining the mini mental state examination ( MMSE ) score , digital symbol substitution ( DSS ; subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised ) , immediate and delayed word recall ( digital memory apparatus-Medicaid systems , Chandigarh , India ) , attention span ( Attention Span Apparatus-Medicaid systems , Chandigarh , India ) , functional activity questionnaire ( FAQ ) and depression ( geriatric depression scale ) scores .
METHODS	Further inflammatory markers and level of oxidative stress were analyzed using standard biochemical tests .
RESULTS	The trial was performed in @ healthy subjects and @ SDAT patients of whom @ healthy subjects and @ SDAT patients completed the study .
RESULTS	Administration of the test formulation for a period of @ months was effective in improving cognitive functions in the SDAT patients , when compared to the donepezil-treated group , as determined by the DSS ( @ @ vs @ @ , P = @ ) , word recall immediate ( @ @ vs @ @ , P < @ ) and attention span ( @ @ vs @ @ , P = @ ) scores .
RESULTS	A significant improvement in the FAQ ( @ @ vs @ @ , P < @ ) and depression ( @ @ vs @ @ , P < @ ) scores was also observed , whereas no significant differences were observed in the MMSE and word recall delayed scores .
RESULTS	The level of inflammation and oxidative stress was markedly reduced in the SDAT patients treated with the test formulation when compared to the donepezil-treated group indicating a likely mechanism of action of the test formulation ( homocysteine @ @ vs @ @ nmol/L , P < @ ; C-reactive protein -LSB- CRP -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ mg/L , P < @ ; tumour necrosis factor alpha -LSB- TNF - -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ pg/ml , P < @ ; superoxide dismutase -LSB- SOD -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ U/g Hb , P = @ ; glutathione peroxidase -LSB- GPx -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ U/g Hb , P < @ ; glutathione -LSB- GSH -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ U/g Hb , P < @ ; thiobarbituric acid reactive substances -LSB- TBARS -RSB- @ @ vs @ @ nmol/g Hb , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , when healthy elderly subjects treated with the test formulation for @ months were compared to the placebo group , a significant ( P < @ ) improvement in cognitive measures ( MMSE , DSS , word recall delayed but not immediate , attention span , FAQ and depression scores ) and a reduction in inflammation ( reduction in homocysteine , CRP , IL-@ and TNF - levels ) and oxidative stress levels ( reduction in SOD , GPx and TBARS and increase in GSH ) was observed .
RESULTS	This indicated a protective effect of the test formulation in managing cognitive decline associated with the ageing process .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this novel polyherbal formulation for the management and treatment of SDAT .

OBJECTIVE	We compared the long-term success of desmopressin sublingual lyophilisate formulation and enuretic alarm therapy in children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis , and determined predictive factors for treatment success .
METHODS	A total of @ children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were randomized to receive treatment consisting of desmopressin or enuretic alarm for @ months .
METHODS	Treatment compliance and response were reviewed monthly in each patient using a @-day bed-wetting diary .
METHODS	Outcomes were assessed according to International Children 's Continence Society criteria , and success rates at @ and @ months were compared for desmopressin and enuretic alarm .
METHODS	Additional intention to treat analyses were performed , considering cases with missing data as failures .
METHODS	Possible demographic factors predicting success were investigated by logistic regression analysis .
RESULTS	Overall @ children ( @ % ) in the desmopressin group and @ ( @ % ) in the enuretic alarm group withdrew after randomization .
RESULTS	Based on patients who completed @ months of treatment , success ( more than @ % reduction in wet nights per month ) was achieved in @ % and @ % of children in the desmopressin and enuretic alarm groups , respectively .
RESULTS	At @ months @ % of those receiving desmopressin and @ % of those treated with enuretic alarm had success .
RESULTS	However , long-term success rate was significantly higher with desmopressin ( @ % vs @ % ) if intention to treat population was considered .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis revealed treatment group , severity of enuresis and monthly income as independent predictors of cure at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	In compliant patients desmopressin lyophilisate and enuretic alarm provided equivalent success at the end of treatment and after extended followup .
CONCLUSIONS	Alarm therapy had a high rate of early withdrawal from therapy and consequently lower rates of success on intention to treat analyses .
CONCLUSIONS	Severe enuresis ( more than @ wet nights weekly ) is an important predictive factor for cure after first-line treatment .

OBJECTIVE	Following from previous research in which post-encoding suggestions of threat led to the development of a memory bias ( in the presumed absence of an attentional bias ; Senn & Radomsky , @ ) , we sought to examine whether the development of a similar threat-relevant memory bias could be fostered via a purely informational pathway .
METHODS	A vignette about a classroom interaction was read aloud to ( n = @ ) undergraduate participants who then completed a post-encoding recall test .
METHODS	Participants were told that the experimenter forgot to read the last sentence of the vignette , and were then randomly assigned either to the Threat condition , in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had a highly contagious flu , or to the No-Threat condition , in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had been accepted to graduate school .
METHODS	A second recall test was then administered .
RESULTS	Participants in the Threat condition ( but not those in the No-Threat condition ) demonstrated aproportionate memory bias in favor of threatening information .
RESULTS	This bias was not evident at the initial recall test .
CONCLUSIONS	Time spent engaging in active recall was not assessed .
CONCLUSIONS	Also , although the study was designed to minimize demand characteristics , it is possible that these played a role .
CONCLUSIONS	An explicit memory bias for threat can be created through informational means alone , even when no threat was present at encoding .
CONCLUSIONS	Results are discussed in terms of pathways to fear and of cognitive approaches to understanding and treating anxiety disorders .

BACKGROUND	Current medical knowledge has provided us with a wide range of possibilities of treating chronic wounds .
BACKGROUND	Over the recent decades , in particular , significant progress has been made in this field .
BACKGROUND	The authors present an overview of current knowledge of chronic wound healing , pointing out the surgeons role in the process of chronic wound management .
BACKGROUND	Using surgical therapy , we are able to heal a chronic wound in a shorter period of time , particularly if the treatment is accelerated by the application of platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) as a source of growth factors .
METHODS	The pilot randomized prospective study included four patients with chronic wounds of the lower leg after previous failure of conservative therapy who were indicated for skin transplantation .
METHODS	Following previous vacuum-assisted closure therapy , the patients undergoing skin transplantation were prospectively randomized into two groups .
METHODS	Autologous PRP was used in one of the groups and standard skin transplantation without PRP was performed in the other one .
RESULTS	In the PRP group , @ % of the wound areas were healed on the @th day after the operation .
RESULTS	In the other group , @ % of the areas were healed on the @th day following the operation .
RESULTS	In the PRP group , complete healing of the defect occurred in both patients at @ and @ days post-surgery .
RESULTS	In the second group , one patient completely healed within @ days ; the other one was not fully healed even at @ months post-surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Most patient groups at great risk may benefit from the method using PRP , as well as patients with chronic wounds who have failed conventional methods available for both general and local therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	This fact has been confirmed by the authors initial experience presented.Key words : platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) - platelets wound healing chronic wound .

OBJECTIVE	To compare lag-screw sliding characteristics and fixation stability of two cephalomedullary nails ( CMN ) with different lag-screw designs ( solid and telescopic ) , we conducted a biomechanical study and an analysis of clinical results .
METHODS	Six pairs of cadaver femurs with simulated intertrochanteric fractures were randomly assigned to one of two CMN fixations .
METHODS	Femur constructs were statically then cyclically loaded on an MTS machine .
METHODS	Lag-screw sliding and inferior and lateral femoral head displacements were measured , following which failure strength of the construct was determined .
METHODS	Forty-five patients with intertrochanteric fractures treated with these CMN were identified .
METHODS	Medical records and radiographs were reviewed and analyzed using Fisher 's exact test and Student 's t test to determine lag-screw sliding .
RESULTS	No difference was seen with cycling in inferior femoral head displacement between the two screw designs .
RESULTS	The solid screw had an average inferior head displacement of @ mm compared with @ mm for the telescoping screw ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The solid lag screws slid an average of @ mm lateral from the nail , whereas the telescoping screws slid an average of @ mm ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In our clinical review , the average lateral sliding of the telescoping screw was @ mm and of the solid screw was @ mm ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Despite differences in lateral sliding , there were no reoperations for prominent or painful hardware in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	Both designs are acceptable devices for stabilization of intertrochanteric fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical and biomechanical data demonstrate greater lateral sliding in the solid lag-screw group , making for greater potential for lateral-sided hip pain in CMNs with solid lag screws as opposed to telescoping lag screws .

BACKGROUND	Growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) is associated with reduced bone mineral content and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures .
BACKGROUND	Reduced peak bone mass might explain the low bone mineral density ( BMD ) among patients with childhood onset GHD ( CO-GHD ) whilst the cause of osteopenia in adult-onset GHD ( AO-GHD ) is not fully understood .
OBJECTIVE	Prospective multicentric study to asses bone status in GHD adults after two years of recombinant growth hormone replacement treatment .
METHODS	In @ GHD adults ( @ men ; @ yrs ) we have measured BMD and bone markers ( CTX , osteocalcin ) during two years of rhGH treatment ( at baseline , after @ and @ months , and after @ and @ years ) .
METHODS	Patients were adequately substituted for GHD and other pituitary deficiencies .
RESULTS	We have observed an increase in BMD-lumbar spine : n = @ , @ @ g/cm@ , p < @ ; femoral neck n = @ ; @ @ ; p = @ ; BMD-whole body @ @ ; p = @ .
RESULTS	We have compared gender difference : BMD-L-spine by @ % in men ( n = @ ) and by @ % in women ( n = @ ) ( p = @ ) ; BMD-femoral neck increased by @ % in men and by about @ % in women ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In women , the initial decrease in BMD was recorded after @ months .
RESULTS	CO-GHD adults yielded a higher increase in BMD - L-spine ( @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	A correlation exists between IGF-I levels and BMD in lumbar spine ( @st year : R = @ , p = @ ; @nd year : R = @ , p = @ ) and between IGF-I and osteocalcin ( @st year : R = @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Two-year therapy with recombinant human growth hormone improved bone status .

OBJECTIVE	The Prevencin con Dieta Mediterrnea ( PREDIMED ) trial showed that a Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet ) supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or @ g/d of mixed nuts reduced incident cardiovascular events compared with a control ( low fat ) diet .
OBJECTIVE	The mechanisms of cardiovascular protection afforded by MedDiets remain to be uncovered .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed the effect of both supplemented MedDiets on internal carotid intima-media thickness ( ICA-IMT ) and plaque height , the ultrasound features that best predict future cardiovascular events , in subjects at high cardiovascular risk .
RESULTS	In a PREDIMED subcohort ( n = @ ) , plaque height and carotid IMT of @ prespecified segments ( ICA , bifurcation , and common ) were sonographically assessed at baseline and after intervention for a mean of @ years .
RESULTS	We evaluated @ subjects with complete data .
RESULTS	In a multivariate model , mean ICA-IMT progressed in the control diet group ( mean -LSB- @ % confidence interval -RSB- , @ mm -LSB- -@ to @ mm -RSB- ) , whereas it regressed in the MedDiet + nuts group ( -@ mm -LSB- -@ to -@ mm -RSB- ; P = @ versus control ) .
RESULTS	Similar results were observed for maximum ICA-IMT ( control , @ mm -LSB- @ to @ mm -RSB- ; MedDiet + nuts , -@ mm -LSB- -@ to @ mm -RSB- ; P = @ ) and maximum plaque height ( control , @ mm -LSB- @ to @ mm -RSB- ; MedDiet + nuts , -@ mm -LSB- -@ to @ mm -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no changes in ICA-IMT or plaque after the MedDiet + extra virgin olive oil .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with a control diet , consumption of a MedDiet supplemented with nuts is associated with delayed progression of ICA-IMT and plaque .
CONCLUSIONS	The results contribute mechanistic evidence for the reduction of cardiovascular events observed in the PREDIMED trial .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the study was to measure contact lens lipid spoliation of silicone hydrogel PureVision ( balafilcon A ) and hydrogel Acuvue @ ( etafilcon A ) contact lenses worn for @ hours single use ( DD ) and @ days of extended wear ( EW ) .
METHODS	Two similar study populations ( DD , n = @ ; EW , n = @ ) , were enrolled at four study sites .
METHODS	In each population , a bilateral , randomized , crossover ( lens material ) , subject-masked experimental design was followed .
METHODS	Worn contact lenses were analyzed for lipid uptake using high-performance liquid chromatography by two laboratories : Alcon Laboratories ( right lens total uptake ) and OTG Research & Consultancy ( left lens total uptake and individual lipid classes ) .
RESULTS	Lipid uptake was different for the two materials : total lipid ( p < @ ) , cholesterol esters ( p < @ ) , cholesterol ( p < @ EW only ) , and triglycerides/phospholipids ( p < @ ) were higher for balafilcon A , whereas fatty acid ( p < @ EW only ) was higher for etafilcon A.
RESULTS	The ratio of the extracted lipids was also different : higher percentages of triglycerides/phospholipids ( p < @ ) and cholesterol ( p < @ EW only ) for balafilcon A and higher percentages of fatty acids/di - and monoglycerides ( p < @ ) for etafilcon A.
CONCLUSIONS	Total lipid uptake was highly material dependent .
CONCLUSIONS	Both laboratories measured a greater uptake of lipids by the silicone hydrogel than the hydrogel material , a difference that was evident after only @ hours of DD .
CONCLUSIONS	Total lipid uptake was greater after @ days of EW compared with @ hours of DD .
CONCLUSIONS	Of interest for contact lens spoliation and its avoidance was the differential lipid uptake profile , indicating material selectivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Whereas greater differentiation between materials was possible after @ days of EW for each material , the lipid uptake profile was similar for DD and EW , indicating a greater material effect than a wear modality effect .

METHODS	Sixty-two patients were randomly allocated to either the nicardipine-sevoflurane ( Group N , n = @ ) , remifentanil-sevoflurane ( Group R , n = @ ) or dexmedetomidine-sevoflurane ( Group D , n = @ ) group for controlled hypotension during orthognathic surgery .
METHODS	Electrocardiogram data acquisition was done after vital sign stabilization following anaesthesia induction ( T@ ) and @min after controlled hypotension was induced ( T@ ) .
RESULTS	Total power and low frequency ( LF ) power was significantly decreased at T@ compared with T@ in all groups , while a decrease in high frequency ( HF ) power was only observed in Group N ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	LF/HF ratios of Group R and D were significantly suppressed at T@ compared with T@ ( P = @ and P < @ , respectively ) , but was increased Group N ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The LF/HF ratio of Group N was significantly higher than Group R and D at T@ ( P < @ in both ) , with Group D showing a significantly lower LF/HF ratio compared with Group R ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine did not have sympathetic nervous system-stimulating effects during controlled hypotension , while remifentanil seemed to be superior in preserving the overall balance in autonomic nervous system activity .
CONCLUSIONS	Nicardipine was found to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system , which may be problematic in patients vulnerable to disturbances in the autonomic nervous system .

BACKGROUND	Vortioxetine ( Lu AA@ ) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of @ pharmacologic actions : direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine @ and @ mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder .
METHODS	This @-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study was conducted from July @ to January @ among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV-TR ) .
METHODS	Eligible subjects were randomized in @:@:@ ratio to @ of @ treatment arms : vortioxetine @ mg , vortioxetine @ mg , or placebo once daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	Subjects who completed the @-week trial entered a @-week blinded discontinuation period to assess potential discontinuation symptoms .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the least squares mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score from baseline .
METHODS	Key secondary outcomes were analyzed in the following prespecified sequential order : MADRS response ( @ % decrease from baseline in total score ) , Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score , change from baseline in MADRS total score in subjects with baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score @ , MADRS remission ( total score @ ) , and change from baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale total score ( all at week @ ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ subjects were randomized to placebo ( n = @ ) , vortioxetine @ mg ( n = @ ) , and vortioxetine @ mg ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean ( SE ) reductions from baseline in MADRS total score ( week @ ) were -@ ( @ ) , -@ ( @ ) , and -@ ( @ ) for the placebo , vortioxetine @ mg ( P = @ vs placebo ) , and vortioxetine @ mg ( P = @ vs placebo ) groups .
RESULTS	MADRS response/remission was achieved in @ % / @ % , @ % / @ % , and @ % / @ % of subjects , respectively , in the @ groups .
RESULTS	Only MADRS response for vortioxetine @ mg significantly separated from placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Treatment was well tolerated , with the most frequently reported adverse events consisting of nausea , headache , diarrhea , and dizziness .
CONCLUSIONS	Vortioxetine @ mg significantly reduced MADRS total score at @ weeks in this study population .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , vortioxetine was well tolerated in this study .

OBJECTIVE	Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of simvastatin for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage .
OBJECTIVE	Two randomized placebo-controlled pilot trials that used the highest clinically approved dose of simvastatin ( @ mg daily ) gave positive results despite the fact that a lower dose of simvastatin ( @ mg daily ) did not improve clinical outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that a high dose of @ mg of simvastatin daily for @ weeks would reduce the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with a lower dose ( @ mg of simvastatin daily ) and lead to improved clinical outcomes .
METHODS	The study design was a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial .
METHODS	Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( presenting within @ hours of the ictus ) from @ neurosurgical centers were recruited for @ years .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the presence of delayed ischemic deficits , and secondary outcome measures included a modified Rankin disability score at @ months and an analysis of cost-effectiveness .
RESULTS	No difference was observed between the groups treated with the higher dose or the lower dose of simvastatin in the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits ( @ % versus @ % ; odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) or in the rate of favorable outcomes ( modified Rankin Scale score , @-@ ) at @ months ( @ % versus @ % ; odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High-dose simvastatin treatment should not be prescribed routinely for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .

OBJECTIVE	We examined the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk and blood pressure in African Americans .
METHODS	Stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a clinical trial , augmented by a Markov model of lifetime cost-effectiveness .
METHODS	In @ urban academic primary care practices , we randomized African American patients with uncontrolled hypertension to a @-month intervention of office practice and peer coach behavioral support ( N = @ ) or informational brochures about CHD risk factors ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Costs were estimated from the perspective of the provider .
METHODS	Outcomes included estimated CHD events avoided over @ months and reduction in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ( mm Hg ) .
METHODS	Subgroup analysis was performed for compliers who received an `` effective '' dose of the peer coach and office staff visits .
METHODS	Long-term cost-effectiveness was estimated by applying the clinical trial cost and effectiveness into a Markov model of CHD risk .
RESULTS	The average cost for the behavioral support intervention group was $ @ compared with $ @ for the brochure control group .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) was $ @ per mm Hg reduction in SBP and $ @,@ per CHD event avoided in @ months .
RESULTS	Modeled over a @-year horizon , the intervention had an ICER only as high as $ @ per incremental quality-adjusted life-year .
CONCLUSIONS	A community-primary care practice behavioral intervention to reduce hypertension in African Americans with sustained uncontrolled hypertension does not appear to be cost-effective in the first @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	If intervention results are sustained over the long term , the program may be cost-effective over the patient 's lifetime .

OBJECTIVE	Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) eligible for enrollment in a randomized controlled trial for a novel oral anticoagulant , the ARISTOTLE trial .
OBJECTIVE	A secondary objective was to describe the reasons for trial ineligibility .
METHODS	We performed a cross-sectional study of an unselected population including @ patients in Skellefte , Sweden with at least one verified episode of AF on or before December @ , @ .
METHODS	Patients were classified as suitable or unsuitable for anticoagulant treatment according to current guidelines .
METHODS	The enrollment criteria from the ARISTOTLE trial were extracted from the original publication and applied to the population .
RESULTS	Among all patients with AF , @ were classified as suitable for anticoagulant treatment .
RESULTS	Of these , only @ patients ( @ % ) were eligible for participation in the ARISTOTLE trial .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients ineligible for participation , @ did not meet the ECG criteria , @ had psychosocial problems , and in addition , @ patients were excluded due to both of these criteria .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study shows that a majority of the patients in an unselected population with AF suitable for anticoagulant treatment were ineligible for participation in the ARISTOTLE trial .
CONCLUSIONS	The applicability of the ARISTOTLE trial is therefore unknown for a considerable proportion of patients with AF in real life .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to test the effect of a brief educational and counseling intervention on increasing the uptake of free testing for Chlamydia trachomatis ( chlamydia ) and Neisseria gonorrhea ( gonorrhea ) among young female emergency department ( ED ) patients .
OBJECTIVE	Women are particularly vulnerable to more serious consequences of these infections due to asymptomatic presentation .
OBJECTIVE	Increased testing is important to detect , treat , and halt the spread of these infections among asymptomatic women .
METHODS	This was a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Research assistants ( RAs ) approached female patients in two EDs .
METHODS	Eligible patients were between @ and @ years of age , who reported having sex with males , but were not attending the ED for either treatment of sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) or testing for possible STI exposure .
METHODS	Participants responded to survey questions about their lifetime and past @-month substance use , number of recent sexual partners , condom use , and perception of risks for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections .
METHODS	Following the survey , the RAs randomized participants into study control or treatment arms .
METHODS	Each treatment arm participant received a brief educational/counseling intervention from the RA .
METHODS	The brief intervention focused on the woman 's personal risks for chlamydia and gonorrhea and condoms attitudes and usage .
METHODS	As the primary outcome of this study , participants were offered free urine tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea infection postintervention or post-survey completion , depending on group assignment .
RESULTS	A total of @ women completed the baseline assessment and were offered chlamydia and gonorrhea testing .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) age was @ ( @ ) years , @ % were Hispanic , and @ % were Spanish-speaking only .
RESULTS	The brief intervention that was offered to increase these women 's awareness of their STI risk did not result in increased acceptance of testing ; @ % in the brief intervention group accepted testing ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ % to @ % ) versus @ % in the control group ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	In a multivariable logistic regression , only self-identifying as being Hispanic was associated with greater willingness to be tested .
RESULTS	Of the asymptomatic women tested ( n = @ ) , five tested positive for chlamydia .
RESULTS	This represents a positivity rate of @ % .
RESULTS	There were no positive test results for gonorrhea .
RESULTS	Women who reported high-risk factors for STI , such as younger age ( @ years ) , having sex in the past @ days without using condoms , identified substance use , or previous STI , were not more likely to accept the offer of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing .
CONCLUSIONS	The brief intervention used in this study did not increase the uptake of testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in this sample , in comparison to receiving no intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Although Hispanic women were more likely to accept chlamydia and gonorrhea testing , it is concerning that those women who report STI risk factors were not more likely to accept the offer of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should focus on the refinement of an intervention protocol to focus on prior STI and lack of condom use to increase the uptake of testing among this high-risk group .

###24557088
BACKGROUND	Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that endogenous neuroactive steroids mediate some effects of alcohol .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dutasteride inhibition of @-reduced neuroactive steroid production on subjective responses to alcohol in adult men .
METHODS	Using a within-subject factorial design , @ men completed four randomly ordered monthly sessions in which pretreatment with @ mg dutasteride or placebo was paired with a moderate dose of alcohol ( @ g/kg ) or placebo beverage .
METHODS	The pharmacologic effect of dutasteride was measured by an assay of serum androstanediol glucuronide .
METHODS	Self-reports of alcohol effects were obtained at @-min intervals following alcohol administration using the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ( BAES ) and the Alcohol Sensation Scale ( SS ) .
METHODS	We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of dutasteride and alcohol on BAES and SS responses and the interaction of dutasteride with the GABRA@ alcohol dependence-associated polymorphism rs@ .
METHODS	We also examined whether exposure to dutasteride influenced drinking in the weeks following each laboratory session .
RESULTS	A single @-mg dose of dutasteride produced a @ % reduction in androstanediol glucuronide .
RESULTS	Dutasteride pretreatment reduced alcohol effects on the BAES sedation and SS anesthesia scales .
RESULTS	There was no interaction of dutasteride with rs@ .
RESULTS	Heavy drinkers had fewer heavy drinking days during the @ weeks following the dutasteride sessions and fewer total drinks in the first week after dutasteride .
CONCLUSIONS	These results provide evidence that neuroactive steroids mediate some of the sedative effects of alcohol in adult men and that dutasteride may reduce drinking , presumably through its effects on neuroactive steroid concentrations .

BACKGROUND	Tapentadol prolonged release ( PR ) is effective and well tolerated for chronic osteoarthritis , low back , and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol PR compared with placebo and morphine controlled release ( CR ) for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain .
METHODS	Randomized-withdrawal , parallel group , active - and placebo-controlled , double-blind phase @ study ( NCT@ ) .
METHODS	Primary , secondary , and tertiary care settings in @ countries .
METHODS	Eligible patients ( pain intensity @ -LSB- @-point numerical rating scale -RSB- on prior analgesics ) were randomized ( @:@ ) and titrated to their optimal dose of tapentadol PR ( @-@ mg bid ) or morphine sulfate CR ( @-@ mg bid ) over @ weeks .
METHODS	Morphine sulfate immediate release @ mg was permitted as needed for rescue medication ( no maximum dose ) .
METHODS	Patients who completed titration and , during the last @ days of titration , had mean pain intensity < @ ( based on twice-daily ratings ) and mean rescue medication use = @ mg/day continued into a @-week maintenance period ; patients who received morphine CR during titration continued taking morphine CR , and those who received tapentadol PR were re-randomized ( @:@ ) to tapentadol PR or placebo bid .
METHODS	Response during maintenance ( primary efficacy endpoint ) was defined as having : ( @ ) completed the maintenance period , ( @ ) a mean pain intensity < @ during maintenance , and ( @ ) used an average of = @ mg/day of rescue medication during maintenance .
METHODS	Response at the end of titration was defined similarly , with pain intensity and rescue medication averages based on the last @ days of titration .
RESULTS	Of @ patients screened , @ were randomized , treated during titration , and evaluable for safety ; @ were re-randomized , treated during maintenance , and evaluable for safety ; and @ were evaluable for efficacy .
RESULTS	The adjusted responder rate estimate during maintenance ( logistic regression adjusting for treatment group , pooled center , and pain intensity at start of maintenance ) was significantly higher with tapentadol PR ( @ % ) than with placebo ( @ % ; odds ratio ( OR ) , @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) , @ - @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Based on responder rates at the end of titration , tapentadol PR ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- ) was non-inferior to morphine CR ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	The lower limit of the @ % CI for the between-groups difference ( -@ % ) was within the pre-specified @ % non-inferiority margin .
RESULTS	During titration , incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were @ % ( @/@ ) with tapentadol PR and @ % ( @/@ ) with morphine CR ; incidences of nausea , vomiting , and dry mouth were lower with tapentadol PR than with morphine CR .
RESULTS	During maintenance , incidences of TEAEs were @ % ( @/@ ) , @ % ( @/@ ) , and @ % ( @/@ ) with placebo , tapentadol PR , and morphine CR , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Statistical comparisons between tapentadol PR and morphine CR were limited to descriptive statistics during the maintenance period because of the pre-selection of responders to tapentadol PR or morphine CR during titration .
CONCLUSIONS	Results obtained during maintenance indicate that tapentadol PR ( @-@ mg bid ) is effective compared with placebo for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on results obtained during titration , tapentadol PR provides comparable efficacy to that of morphine sulfate CR ( @-@ mg bid ) , but is associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a single dose of @g of clonidine as an adjuvant to levobupivacaine ( Chirocaine ( ) ) in retrobulbar block on postoperative safety and analgesia .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind trial .
METHODS	One hundred twenty patients with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment scheduled to undergo external buckling surgery and cryocoagulation were asked to participate .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned either to receive @-@mL Chirocaine ( @-@ @ mg ) or @-@mL Chirocaine and @mL clonidine ( @g ) before surgery .
METHODS	Main outcome measures were postoperative pain , use of analgesics , blood pressure , and plasma clonidine concentration .
METHODS	Nine nonrandomized patients consented to give blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in pain score between both groups .
RESULTS	On average , the use of analgesic medication occurred later in the clonidine group ( P = @ ) , but there was no statistical difference in the first time that postoperative medication was taken ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Blood pressure was reduced by clonidine ( systolic : P = @ , diastolic : P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Clonidine levels could be demonstrated during the @-h postoperative period , with an average half-life of @h .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of clonidine as an adjuvant to conventional retrobulbar block is safe , and delays the postoperative use of analgesics .
CONCLUSIONS	The reduction of postoperative pain and the time of first use of analgesic medication , however , were not significantly different between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Further , pain scores in both study groups remained low .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the beneficial effect of clonidine in conventional scleral buckle surgery appears to be limited .

OBJECTIVE	Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by impaired bone turnover and compromised bone strength , thereby predisposing to increased risk of fracture .
OBJECTIVE	Preclinical research has shown that compounds produced by the olive tree ( Olea europaea ) , may protect from bone loss , by increasing osteoblast activity at the expense of adipocyte formation .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this exploratory study was to obtain a first insight on the effect of intake of an olive extract on bone turnover in postmenopausal women with decreased bone mass ( osteopenia ) .
METHODS	For that , a double blind , placebo-controlled study was performed in which participants were randomly allocated to either treatment or placebo groups .
METHODS	@ osteopenic patients , with a mean bone mineral density ( BMD ) T-score between -@ and -@ in the lumbar spine ( L@-L@ ) were included in the study .
METHODS	PARTICIPANTS received for @ months daily either @ mg/day of olive extract and @ mg Ca ( treatment ) or @ mg Ca alone ( placebo ) .
METHODS	Primary endpoints consisted of evaluation of bone turnover markers .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included BMD measurements and blood lipid profiles .
RESULTS	After @ months , the levels of the pro-osteoblastic marker osteocalcin were found to significantly increase in the treatment group as compared to placebo .
RESULTS	Simultaneously , BMD decreased in the placebo group , while remaining stable in the treatment group .
RESULTS	In addition , improved lipid profiles were observed , with significant decrease in total - and LDL-cholesterol in the treatment group .
CONCLUSIONS	This exploratory study supports preclinical observations and warrants further research by showing that a specific olive polyphenol extract ( Bonolive ) affects serum osteocalcin levels and may stabilize lumbar spine BMD .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , the improved blood lipid profiles suggest additional health benefits associated to the intake of the olive polyphenol extract .

BACKGROUND	Recruitment is a challenge in developing population-representative pregnancy and birth cohorts .
METHODS	We developed a collaborative recruitment infrastructure ( CRI ) to recruit pregnant women for @ pregnancy cohorts using : faxes from obstetrical offices , in-clinic recruiters , university and funder-driven free-media events , paid-media , and attendance at relevant tradeshows .
METHODS	Recruitment rates and demographic differences were compared between recruitment methods .
RESULTS	We received @ referrals over @ months .
RESULTS	Compared to fax , free-media referrals were @ times more likely to be recruited ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ : p < @ ) and paid-media referrals were @ times more likely to be recruited ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ : p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Among paid-media advertisements , free-to-read print ( e.g. Metro ) was the most effective ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ : p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Several demographic differences were identified between recruitment methods and against a reference population .
RESULTS	Between recruitment methods , media recruits had a similar proportion families with incomes $ @,@ ( paid-media : @ % ; free-media : @ % ) compared to fax recruits ( @ % ) , while in-clinic recruits were less likely to have family incomes $ @,@ ( @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Maternal recruits from fax and in-clinic were more likely to attend university ( Fax : @ % , in-clinic @ % ) versus the reference population ( @ % ; p < @ for both ) and both were less likely to smoke ( Fax : @ % , in-clinic @ % ) versus reference ( @ % ; p < @ for both ) .
RESULTS	However , while fax referrals were more likely to be Caucasian ( @ % versus reference @ % ; p < @ ) , in-clinic referrals were not significantly different ( @ % ; P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Recruitment methods result in different recruitment rates and participant demographics .
CONCLUSIONS	A variety of methods are required to recruit a generalizable sample .

BACKGROUND	Research on contingency management to treat excessive alcohol use is limited due to feasibility issues with monitoring adherence .
BACKGROUND	This study examined the effectiveness of using transdermal alcohol monitoring as a continuous measure of alcohol use to implement financial contingencies to reduce heavy drinking .
METHODS	Twenty-six male and female drinkers ( from @ to @ years old ) were recruited from the community .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment sequences .
METHODS	Sequence @ received @ weeks of no financial contingency ( i.e. , $ @ ) drinking followed by @ weeks each of $ @ and then $ @ contingency management ; Sequence @ received @ weeks of $ @ contingency management followed by @ weeks each of no contingency ( i.e. , $ @ ) and then $ @ contingency management .
METHODS	During the $ @ and $ @ contingency management conditions , participants were paid each week when the Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor ( SCRAM-II ) identified no heavy drinking days .
RESULTS	Participants in both contingency management conditions had fewer drinking episodes and reduced frequencies of heavy drinking compared to the $ @ condition .
RESULTS	Participants randomized to Sequence @ ( receiving $ @ contingency before the $ @ condition ) exhibited less frequent drinking and less heavy drinking in the $ @ condition compared to participants from Sequence @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Transdermal alcohol monitoring can be used to implement contingency management programs to reduce excessive alcohol consumption .

OBJECTIVE	In the European HIT-SIOP PNET@ randomized controlled trial , children with standard risk medulloblastoma were allocated to hyperfractionated radiation therapy ( HFRT arm , including a partially focused boost ) or standard radiation therapy ( STRT arm ) , followed , in both arms , by maintenance chemotherapy .
OBJECTIVE	Event-free survival was similar in both arms .
OBJECTIVE	Previous work showed that the HFRT arm was associated with worse growth and better questionnaire-based executive function , especially in children < @years of age at diagnosis .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , the aim of this study was to compare performance-based cognitive outcomes between treatment arms .
METHODS	Neuropsychological data were collected prospectively in @ patients .
METHODS	Using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales , Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children , and Raven 's Progressive Matrices , we estimated full-scale intelligence quotient ( FSIQ ) and , when available , verbal IQ ( VIQ ) , performance IQ ( PIQ ) , working memory index ( WMI ) , and processing speed index ( PSI ) .
RESULTS	Among the @ participants ( HFRT arm n = @ , STRT arm n = @ , @ % males ) , mean ( SD ) ages at diagnosis and assessment respectively were @ ( @ ) years of age ( @ % < @years of age at diagnosis ) and @ ( @ ) years of age .
RESULTS	Mean ( SD ) FSIQ was @ ( @ ) , and mean intergroup difference was @ ( @ % confidence interval : -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found in children > @years of age at diagnosis .
RESULTS	In children < @years of age at diagnosis , a marginally significant trend toward higher VIQ was found in those treated in the HFRT arm ; a similar trend was found for PSI but not for PIQ , WMI , or FSIQ ( mean intergroup differences were : @ for VIQ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ ; P = @ -RSB- ; @ for PIQ -LSB- @ % CI : -@ to @ ; P > @ -RSB- ; @ for WMI -LSB- @ % CI : -@ to @ ; P > @ -RSB- ; @ for PSI -LSB- @ % CI : -@ to @ ; P = @ -RSB- ; and @ for FSIQ -LSB- @ % CI : -@ to @ ; P > @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	HFRT was associated with marginally higher VIQ in children < @years of age at diagnosis , consistent with a previous report using questionnaire-based data .
CONCLUSIONS	However , overall cognitive ability was not significantly different .

METHODS	Thirty-eight patients with periodontitis and good general health were included in a randomized , single-blind , split-mouth clinical trial .
METHODS	Probing depths and clinical attachment levels were recorded at baseline and @weeks after treatment .
METHODS	Performed treatment procedures were scaling and root planing using two types of local anesthesia for separate treatment appointments .
METHODS	Anesthetics used were intra-pocket lidocaine and prilocaine gel ( @ % each ) and injected articaine ( @:@,@ adrenaline ) .
METHODS	Type of anesthesia for first appointment was randomized and switched for second appointment .
METHODS	Patients ' pain perception and anesthesia acceptance were recorded on questionnaires .
RESULTS	No influence of applied type of anesthesia could be detected for change of probing pocket depths and clinical attachment level ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	These findings are valid even for deeper pockets .
RESULTS	Gel-group had significant higher intra-operative pain perception .
RESULTS	In retrospect @ % of patients favored gel .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment outcome is not compromised by use of anesthesia gel in comparison to injected anesthesia .
CONCLUSIONS	The same beneficial results for probing pocket depths and clinical attachment gain could be detected .
CONCLUSIONS	The majority of patients prefer local anesthesia gel despite a slightly greater procedural discomfort .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the clinical values of detecting drug related molecules excision repair cross complementing @ ( ERCC@ ) and top-isomerase I ( TOPO I ) in individualized therapies of metastatic colorectal cancer .
METHODS	From June @ to December @ , @ patients at Huadong Hospital with metastatic colorectal cancer were randomly separated into @ groups after operation .
METHODS	Each group had @ patients without difference in gender , age or TNM stage .
METHODS	The expressions of ERCC@ and TOPO Iin cancer tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining .
METHODS	The testing group received individualized chemotherapies following the expression results while the control group had random chemotherapies .
METHODS	The survival difference between two groups was analyzed by log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis .
METHODS	And curative effect was analyzed by ( @ ) or Fisher 's analysis .
RESULTS	The expressions of ERCC@ and TOPO I had no statistical significance between two groups ( both P > @ ) .
RESULTS	In the testing group , the median survival time was @ days and the beneficial ratio @ % ( @/@ ) versus @ days and @ % ( @/@ ) respectively in the control group .
RESULTS	The inter-group comparisons of survival ( P = @ ) and curative effect ( ( @ ) = @ , P > @ ) showed no statistical significance .
RESULTS	In the estimated drug tolerated group ( ERCC@ high expression or TOPO I low expression ) , the median survival time was @ days and the beneficial ratio @/@ versus @ days and @ % ( @/@ ) in the estimated drug sensitive group .
RESULTS	The inter-group comparisons of survival and curative effect ( both P < @ ) had statistical significance .
RESULTS	The median survival time and beneficial ratio significantly increased in estimated drug sensitive group than those in estimated drug tolerated group .
CONCLUSIONS	The expression of drug related molecule in colorectal cancer tissue is significantly associated with curative effect in patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with down-regulated ERCC@ on Oxaliplatin or up-regulated TOPO Ion Irinotecan have longer survival and better curative effect .
CONCLUSIONS	And chemotherapies guided by drug related molecule detection may boost curative effects in metastatic colorectal cancer .

BACKGROUND	Biodegradable-polymer drug-eluting stents ( BP-DES ) were developed to be as effective as second-generation durable-polymer drug-eluting stents ( DP-DES ) and as safe > @ year as bare-metal stents ( BMS ) .
BACKGROUND	Thus , very late stent thrombosis ( VLST ) attributable to durable polymers should no longer appear .
RESULTS	To address these early and late aspects , @ patients presenting with acute or stable coronary disease needing stents @ mm in diameter between April @ and May @ were randomly assigned to biolimus-A@-eluting BP-DES , second-generation everolimus-eluting DP-DES , or thin-strut silicon-carbide-coated BMS in @ European centers .
RESULTS	All patients were treated with aspirin and risk-adjusted doses of prasugrel .
RESULTS	The primary end point was combined cardiac death , myocardial infarction , and clinically indicated target-vessel revascularization within @ years .
RESULTS	The combined secondary safety end point was a composite of VLST , myocardial infarction , and cardiac death .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of the primary end point was @ % with BP-DES , @ % with DP-DES , and @ % with BMS .
RESULTS	By intention-to-treat BP-DES were noninferior ( predefined margin , @ % ) compared with DP-DES ( absolute risk difference , @ % ; -@ % to @ % ; P for noninferiority @ ; per protocol P = @ ) and superior to BMS ( absolute risk difference , -@ ; -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @ stent groups did not differ in the combined safety end point , with no decrease in events > @ year , particularly VLST with BP-DES .
CONCLUSIONS	In large vessel stenting , BP-DES appeared barely noninferior compared with DP-DES and more effective than thin-strut BMS , but without evidence for better safety nor lower VLST rates > @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings challenge the concept that durable polymers are key in VLST formation .

BACKGROUND	The World Health Organization recommends vitamin A supplementation ( VAS ) at routine vaccination contacts after @ months of age based on the assumption that it reduces mortality by @ % .
BACKGROUND	The policy has never been evaluated in randomized controlled trials for its effect on overall mortality .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of VAS with vaccines .
METHODS	We randomized children aged @ to @ months @:@ to VAS ( @ IU if aged @-@ months , @ IU if aged @-@ months ) or placebo at vaccination contacts in Guinea-Bissau .
METHODS	Mortality rates were compared in Cox proportional-hazards models overall , and by gender and vaccine .
RESULTS	Between August @ and November @ , @ children were enrolled .
RESULTS	Within @ months of follow-up @ nonaccident deaths occurred ( VAS : @ ; placebo : @ ) .
RESULTS	The mortality rate ratio ( MRR ) comparing VAS versus placebo recipients was @ ( @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) and differed significantly between boys ( MRR @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) and girls ( MRR @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) ( P = @ for interaction between VAS and gender ) .
RESULTS	At enrollment , @ % ( @/@ ) received live measles vaccine , @ % ( @/@ ) received inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccines , and @ % ( @/@ ) received both live and inactivated vaccines .
RESULTS	The effect of VAS did not differ by vaccine group .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of the policy on overall mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	VAS had no overall effect , but the effect differed significantly by gender .

OBJECTIVE	Sedation-analgesia is recommended for comfortable colonoscopy procedures , which are invasive and can be painful .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to compare the combinations of propofol-alfentanil and propofol-fentanyl for sedation-analgesia in elective colonoscopy patients .
METHODS	This prospective and randomized study was planned in ASA I-II groups and included @ patients between the ages of @ and @ years .
METHODS	Sedation-analgesia induction was performed as @ g.kg ( -@ ) fentanyl , @mg .
METHODS	kg ( -@ ) propofol in the propofol-fentanyl group ( Group PF ) and @ g.kg ( -@ ) alfentanil , @mg .
METHODS	kg ( -@ ) propofol in the propofol-alfentanil group ( Group PA ) .
METHODS	Patients ' scores were limited to @-@ values on the Ramsey Sedation Scale ( RSS ) by @ mg.kg ( -@ ) bolus additional doses of propofol in sedation-analgesia maintenance .
METHODS	We recorded demographical data , heart rate , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , oxygen saturation of hemoglobin ( SpO@ ) , RSS value , colonoscopy time , total dose of propofol , complications , recovery time , and discharge time , as well as colonoscopist and patient satisfaction scores .
RESULTS	MAP at the @ ( th ) minute in Group PA was significantly higher than in Group PF ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Group PA 's beginning mean heart rate was higher than the mean heart rate at subsequent readings ( p = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean total propofol dose of Group PA was significantly higher than the total dose of Group PF ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean recovery time of Group PA was significantly longer than that of Group PF ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Fentanyl provides better operative conditions and reduces the need for additional propofol doses .
CONCLUSIONS	These advantages cause a shorter recovery time .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , propofol-fentanyl is superior to the propofol-alfentanil for sedation-analgesia in colonoscopy .

BACKGROUND	New-onset diabetes after transplantation ( NODAT ) is a common complication after renal transplantation .
BACKGROUND	There are limited available oral drugs to treat hyperglycaemia in this population owing to reduced renal function , potential interactions with immunosuppressive drugs and adverse effects such as hypoglycaemic events that may increase the cardiovascular risk .
BACKGROUND	This study was initiated to investigate efficacy and safety of sitagliptin treatment that may represent a novel alternative in renal transplant recipients .
METHODS	Nineteen long-term stable renal transplant recipients with NODAT were included in a controlled , cross-over study and randomized to first receive either sitagliptin @-@ mg/day or a sitagliptin-free period of @ weeks .
METHODS	Median age ( interquartile range , IQR ) was @ ( @-@ ) years ( @ males/@ females ) , all studied @ ( @-@ ) year after transplantation .
METHODS	The immunosuppressive regimen was a triple calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy .
METHODS	Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) with insulin and C-peptide responses and laser Doppler ( LD ) flowmetry assessment of endothelial function were performed at baseline and after each treatment period .
METHODS	Home measurements of plasma glucose were performed daily during the study .
RESULTS	The median ( IQR ) first - and second-phase insulin secretion responses increased significantly by @ % ( @-@ @ % , P = @ ) and @ % ( @-@ @ % , P = @ ) , respectively , following sitagliptin treatment as compared with no sitagliptin treatment .
RESULTS	Fasting and @-h plasma glucose concentrations fell significantly -LCB- @ mmol/L -LSB- @-@ @ mmol/L ( @ mg/dL ) , P = @ -RSB- and @ mmol/L -LSB- @-@ @ mmol/L ( @ mg/dL ) , P = @ -RSB- , respectively -RCB- , as did also home measurements of plasma glucose .
RESULTS	Endothelial function and plasma markers of cardiovascular risk were unaffected .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were observed .
RESULTS	Two mild and asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were observed in combination with glipizide .
CONCLUSIONS	Sitagliptin increases insulin secretion and reduces fasting and postprandial plasma glucose in renal transplant recipients with NODAT .
CONCLUSIONS	The short-term treatment was well tolerated , and sitagliptin seems safe in this population .

BACKGROUND	Sepsis , a leading cause of death in critically ill patients , is the result of complex interactions between the infecting microorganisms and the host responses that influence clinical outcomes .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the prognostic value of presepsin ( sCD@-ST ) , a novel biomarker of bacterial infection , and compared it with procalcitonin ( PCT ) .
METHODS	This is a retrospective , case-control study of a multicenter , randomized clinical trial enrolling patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in ICUs in Italy .
METHODS	We selected @ survivors and @ non-survivors at ICU discharge , matched for age , sex and time from sepsis diagnosis to enrollment .
METHODS	Plasma samples were collected @ , @ and @ days after enrollment to assay presepsin and PCT .
METHODS	Outcome was assessed @ and @ days after enrollment .
RESULTS	Early presepsin ( day @ ) was higher in decedents ( @,@ pg/ml , median ( Q@ to Q@ ) , @,@ to @,@ pg/ml ) than in survivors ( @,@ pg/ml ( median , @ to @,@ ) ; P = @ ) , whereas PCT was not different ( @ g/L ( median @ to @ ) and @ g/L ( @ to @ ) ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The evolution of presepsin levels over time was significantly different in survivors compared to decedents ( P for time-survival interaction = @ ) , whereas PCT decreased similarly in the two groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Presepsin was the only variable independently associated with ICU and @-day mortality in Cox models adjusted for clinical characteristics .
RESULTS	It showed better prognostic accuracy than PCT in the range of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ( area under the curve ( AUC ) from @ to @ vs. AUC @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this multicenter clinical trial , we provide the first evidence that presepsin measurements may have useful prognostic information for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary findings suggest that presepsin may be of clinical importance for early risk stratification .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of celecoxib for treatment of withdrawal headache vs prednisone in patients with medication overuse headache ( MOH ) .
METHODS	In this prospective , double-blind , parallel-group clinical trial , @ consecutive subjects with MOH were randomized ( simple randomization using computer-generated numbers ) for treatment with either @mg/day celecoxib ( for the first @ days then decreased at a rate of @mg every @ days ) or prednisone @ mg/day orally ( for the first @ days then tapered off every @ days ) .
METHODS	Subjects who met the International Headache Society criteria for MOH were included in the trial .
METHODS	The change in headache days and intake of rescue medication were considered as primary outcomes while the change in headache severity defined as a secondary outcome .
RESULTS	Patients treated with celecoxib experienced lower headache intensity during the first @ weeks after withdrawal ( after @ weeks , the median of visual analog scale was @ for patients in celecoxib group vs @ for prednisone group -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	However , headache frequency and the need for rescue medication intake were not different between @ groups .
CONCLUSIONS	During withdrawal in MOH , in order to reduce headache days or rescue medication intake , using either of celecoxib or prednisone as a bridge is not different .

OBJECTIVE	Short-term dietary glucose supplementation has been shown to accelerate the gastric emptying rate of both glucose and fructose solutions .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine gastric emptying rate responses to monosaccharide ingestion following short-term dietary fructose supplementation .
METHODS	The gastric emptying rate of a fructose solution containing @ g of fructose and an equicaloric glucose solution containing @ g glucose monohydrate were measured in @ healthy non-smoking men with and without prior fructose supplementation ( water control ) using a randomized crossover design .
METHODS	Gastric emptying rate was assessed for a period of @ h using the -LSB- ( @ ) C -RSB- breath test with sample collections at baseline and @-min intervals following drink ingestion .
METHODS	Additionally , appetite ratings of hunger , fullness , and prospective food consumption were recorded at baseline and every @ min using visual analog scales .
RESULTS	Increased dietary fructose ingestion resulted in significantly accelerated half-emptying time of a fructose solution ( mean = @ , SD = @ versus @ , SD = @ min control ; P = @ ) , whereas the emptying of a glucose solution remained unchanged ( mean = @ , SD = @ versus @ , SD = @ min control ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Time of maximal emptying rate of fructose was also significantly accelerated following increased dietary fructose intake ( mean = @ , SD = @ versus @ , SD = @ min control ; P = @ ) , while it remained unchanged for glucose ( mean = @ , SD = @ versus @ , SD = @ min control ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No effects of supplementation were observed for appetite measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Three d of supplementation with @ g/d of fructose resulted in an acceleration of gastric emptying rate of a fructose solution but not a glucose solution .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate intraocular lens ( IOL ) axial movements and refractive changes during a @-month follow-up period after femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and conventional cataract surgery , investigate the influence of capsulorhexis features on postoperative IOL axial changes , and assess the prediction error for both techniques .
METHODS	Eighty eyes of @ candidates for cataract extraction were randomized into two groups : femtosecond laser ( @ eyes ) and manual ( @ eyes ) .
RESULTS	The overall anterior chamber depth variation was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser group compared to the manual group during follow-up ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ and @ days postoperatively , the mean spherical equivalent showed a hyperopic shift ( @ diopters -LSB- D -RSB- ) in the femtosecond laser group and a myopic shift in the manual group ( -@ D ) .
RESULTS	Median absolute error was not significantly different between the two groups with standard formulas ranging between @ and @ ( Hoffer Q ) in the femtosecond laser group and between @ ( SRK-T ) and @ D ( Hoffer Q ) in the manual group .
RESULTS	There was a significant lower deviation from intended versus achieved capsulotomy/capsulorhexis area in the femtosecond laser group ( P < @ ) compared to the manual group .
RESULTS	The femtosecond laser group showed better IOL centration compared to the manual group at all time periods ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was related to a lower overall variability of anterior chamber depth compared to conventional cataract surgery with more stable postoperative refraction .
CONCLUSIONS	The two techniques did not show significant differences of prediction error .

###24337154
OBJECTIVE	Insulin-sensitive tissues ( muscle , liver ) of individuals with obesity and type @ diabetes mellitus are in a state of low-grade inflammation , characterised by increased Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) expression and TLR-driven signalling .
OBJECTIVE	However , the cause of this mild inflammatory state is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that a prolonged mild increase in plasma NEFA will increase TLR expression and TLR-driven signalling ( nuclear factor B -LSB- NFB -RSB- and mitogen-activated kinase -LSB- MAPK -RSB- ) and impair insulin action in muscle of lean healthy individuals .
METHODS	Twelve lean , normal-glucose-tolerant participants were randomised to receive a @ h infusion ( @ ml/h ) of saline or Intralipid followed by a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp .
METHODS	Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed before and during the clamp .
RESULTS	Lipid infusion impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-@ tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The elevation in circulating NEFA increased expression of TLR@ , TLR@ and TLR@ , and several MAPK ( MAPK@ , MAP@K@ , MAP@K@ ) and inhibitor of B kinase-NFB ( CHUK -LSB- IKKA -RSB- , c-REL -LSB- REL -RSB- and p@ -LSB- RELA , NFKB@ , p@ -RSB- ) signalling genes ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The lipid infusion also increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) phosphorylation ( p < @ ) and tended to reduce the content of inhibitor of kappa B ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The muscle content of most diacylglycerol , ceramide and acylcarnitine species was unaffected .
RESULTS	In summary , insulin resistance induced by prolonged low-dose lipid infusion occurs together with increased TLR-driven inflammatory signalling and impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-@ tyrosine phosphorylation .
CONCLUSIONS	A sustained , mild elevation in plasma NEFA is sufficient to increase TLR expression and TLR-driven signalling ( NFB and MAPK ) in lean individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	The activation of this pathway by NEFA may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in humans .

OBJECTIVE	WARCEF randomized @,@ patients in sinus rhythm with ejection fraction ( EF ) @ % to warfarin ( INR @-@ @ ) or aspirin @ mg .
OBJECTIVE	Warfarin reduced the incident ischemic stroke ( IIS ) hazard rate by @ % over aspirin in a secondary analysis .
OBJECTIVE	The IIS rate in heart failure ( HF ) is too low to warrant routine anticoagulation but epidemiologic studies show that prior stroke increases the stroke risk in HF .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , we explore IIS rates in WARCEF patients with and without baseline stroke to look for risk factors for IIS and determine if a subgroup with an IIS rate high enough to give a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction can be identified .
METHODS	We compared potential stroke risk factors between patients with baseline stroke and those without using the exact conditional score test for Poisson variables .
METHODS	We looked for risk factors for IIS , by comparing IIS rates between different risk factors .
METHODS	For EF we tried cut-off points of @ , @ and @ % .
METHODS	The cut-off point @ % was used as it was the highest EF that was associated with a significant increase in IIS rate .
METHODS	IIS and EF strata were balanced as to warfarin/aspirin assignment by the stratified randomized design .
METHODS	A multiple Poisson regression examined the simultaneous effects of all risk factors on IIS rate .
METHODS	IIS rates per hundred patient years ( / @ PY ) were calculated in patient groups with significant risk factors .
METHODS	Missing values were assigned the modal value .
RESULTS	Twenty of @ ( @ % ) patients with baseline stroke and @ of @,@ ( @ % ) without had IIS .
RESULTS	IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke ( @ / @ PY ) was greater than patients without ( @ / @ PY ) ( rate ratio @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Fourteen of @ ( @ % ) patients with ejection fraction ( EF ) < @ % and @ of @,@ ( @ % ) with EF @ % had IIS .
RESULTS	In the multiple regression analysis stroke at baseline ( p < @ ) and EF < @ % vs. @ % ( p = @ ) remained significant predictors of IIS .
RESULTS	IIS rate was @ / @ PY in patients with EF < @ % and @ / @ PY in patients with EF @ % ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke and reduced EF was @ / @ PY with EF < @ % decreasing to @ / @ PY with EF < @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	In a WARCEF exploratory analysis , prior stroke and EF < @ % were risk factors for IIS .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to determine if a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction is obtainable with warfarin in HF patients with prior stroke and reduced EF .

OBJECTIVE	High intake of added sweeteners is considered to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders .
OBJECTIVE	Especially , high-fructose intake is regarded as potentially harmful to cardiometabolic health .
OBJECTIVE	It may cause not only weight gain but also low-grade inflammation , which represents an independent risk factor for developing type @ diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
OBJECTIVE	In particular , fructose has been suggested to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-@ ( PAI-@ ) expression in the liver and to increase circulating inflammatory cytokines .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore aimed to investigate , whether high-fructose diet has an impact on PAI-@ , monocyte chemoattractant protein-@ ( MCP-@ ) , e-selectin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentrations in healthy humans .
METHODS	We studied @ participants ( @ males and @ females ) of the TUebingen FRuctose Or Glucose study .
METHODS	This is an exploratory , parallel , prospective , randomized , single-blinded , outpatient , hypercaloric , intervention study .
METHODS	The participants had a mean age of @ @ years and a mean body mass index of @ @ kg/m ( @ ) and they received @ g of either fructose or glucose per day for @ weeks .
RESULTS	There were neither significant changes of PAI-@ , MCP-@ , e-selectin and CRP after fructose ( n = @ ) and glucose ( n = @ ) intervention nor treatment effects ( all P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , we did not observe longitudinal associations of the inflammatory parameters with triglycerides , liver fat , visceral fat and body weight in the fructose group .
CONCLUSIONS	Temporary high-fructose intake does not seem to cause inflammation in apparently healthy people in this secondary analysis of a small feeding trial .

BACKGROUND	Studies have demonstrated that plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate ( PKEP ) and open prostatectomy ( OP ) have equivalent short-term efficacy for large prostates , but no comparison concerning their long-term results was reported .
OBJECTIVE	To demonstrate the noninferiority of PKEP to OP concerning maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) at @ yr postoperatively and to compare the long-term results of both procedures .
METHODS	From @ to @ , @ patients with prostates > @g were randomized to receive PKEP or OP .
METHODS	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) completed the noninferiority study , and @ patients ( @ % ) finished a @-yr follow-up assessment .
METHODS	The PKEP procedures were performed with @F Karl Storz continuous flow resectoscopy and the Gyrus PlasmaKinetic device .
METHODS	OP was performed by a suprapubic transvesical approach .
METHODS	The primary end point was Qmax at @ yr postoperatively .
METHODS	Secondary end points included other perioperative parameters and postoperative micturition variables .
METHODS	The student t test , Mann-Whitney U test , chi-square test , or Fisher exact probability test was used as appropriate .
CONCLUSIONS	PKEP was noninferior to OP regarding Qmax at @ yr postoperatively .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with OP , PKEP was associated with less perioperative hemoglobin decrease , shorter catheterization time , and shorter postoperative hospital stay ( @ vs @ g/dl , @ vs @h , and @ vs @ d , respectively ; p < @ for all ) , as well as fewer short-term complications ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	On intention-to-treat analysis , both the PKEP and OP groups had equivalent Qmax ( @ ml/s vs @ ml/s , respectively ; p = @ ) , International Prostate Symptom Score ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , respectively p = @ ) , quality of life ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , respectively ; p = @ ) , and postvoid residual urine ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ml , respectively ; p = @ ) at @ mo postoperatively .
CONCLUSIONS	No patients required reoperation because of recurrence of BPH .
CONCLUSIONS	The relatively small sample size is the limitation .
CONCLUSIONS	PKEP is a durable procedure with short - to long-term micturition improvement equivalent to OP and significantly lower perioperative morbidity .
RESULTS	We compared PKEP with OP for large prostates and found that PKEP is less invasive , with short - to long-term micturition improvement equivalent to OP .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the long-term effects of an illicit drug use prevention program for adolescents that integrates life skills into the theory of planned behavior .
METHODS	We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in which @ participating schools were randomized to either an intervention group ( @ schools , n = @,@ students ) or a control group ( @schools , n = @ students ) .
METHODS	Participants were grade @ students .
METHODS	The intervention comprised a main intervention of @ sessions and two booster interventions .
METHODS	Booster @ ( four sessions ) and booster @ ( two sessions ) were performed at @months and @months , respectively , after completion of the main intervention .
METHODS	Assessments were made at baseline , after the main intervention , and after each booster session using specific questionnaires for measuring participants ' attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioral control , and life skills .
RESULTS	Retention rates were @ % ( @/@ ,@ ) in the intervention group and @ % ( @/@ ) in the control group after the @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	A significantly lower proportion of intervention group participants reported illicit drug use after the first and second booster sessions compared with control group participants ( @ % vs. @ % and @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; both p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioral control , life skills , and behavioral intention scores of theintervention group were significantly higher than those of control group after the first and second booster sessions ( all p < @ ) , suggesting that intervention group students tended to avoid drug use .
CONCLUSIONS	A drug use prevention program integrating life skills into the theory of planned behavior may be effective for reducing illicit drug use and improving planned behavior-related constructs in adolescents .

OBJECTIVE	Presepsin is a soluble fragment of the cluster-of-differentiation marker protein @ ( CD@ ) involved in pathogen recognition by innate immunity .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the relation between its circulating concentration , host response , appropriateness of antibiotic therapy , and mortality in patients with severe sepsis .
METHODS	Plasma presepsin was measured @ , @ , and @ days after enrollment of @ patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the multicenter Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis ( ALBIOS ) trial .
METHODS	They were randomized to albumin or crystalloids .
METHODS	We tested with univariate and adjusted models the association of single measurements of presepsin or changes over time with clinical events , organ dysfunctions , appropriateness of antibiotic therapy , and ICU or @-day mortality .
RESULTS	Presepsin concentration at baseline ( @ -LSB- @-@ ,@ -RSB- ng/L ) increased with the SOFA score , the number of prevalent organ dysfunctions or failures , and the incidence of new failures of the respiratory , coagulation , liver , and kidney systems .
RESULTS	The concentration decreased in ICU over @ days in patients with negative blood cultures , and in those with positive blood cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy ; it increased with inappropriate antibiotic therapy ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Baseline presepsin was independently associated with , and correctly reclassified , the risk of ICU and @-day mortality .
RESULTS	Increasing concentrations of presepsin from day @ to day @ predicted higher ICU and @-day mortality ( adjusted p < @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Albumin had no effect on presepsin concentration .
CONCLUSIONS	Presepsin is an early predictor of host response and mortality in septic patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Changes in concentrations over time seem to reflect the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy .

BACKGROUND	The methacholine challenge test quantifies airway hyper-responsiveness , which is measured by the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a @ % decrease in forced expiration volume in @ second ( PC@ ) .
BACKGROUND	The dose-response effect of inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) on PC@ has been inconsistent and within-patient variability of PC@ is not well established .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of high - vs low-dose ICS on PC@ and within-patient variability in those with repeated measurements of PC@ .
METHODS	A randomized , double-masked , crossover trial was conducted in patients with asthma on controller medications with PC@ of @ mg/mL or lower ( n = @ ) to evaluate the effect of high-dose ( @,@ g/d ) vs low-dose ( @ g/d ) fluticasone for @ weeks on PC@ .
METHODS	In addition , the variability of PC@ was assessed in participants who underwent @ or @ PC@ measurements on the same dose of ICS ( n = @ ) over a @-week interval .
RESULTS	Because there was a significant period effect , dose comparison of the change in PC@ was assessed in the first treatment period .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the change in PC@ for high - vs low-dose ICS ( @ % vs @ % increase , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The within - and between-participant variances for log PC@ were @ and @ , respectively , with an intra-class correlation of @ , and @ % of participants had more than @ doubling dose changes in PC@ in those with repeated measurements .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect of ICS on PC@ is not dose dependent at fluticasone levels of @ and @,@ g/d .
CONCLUSIONS	Interpersonal variability for PC@ is large .
CONCLUSIONS	A lack of precise measurements should be taken into account when interpreting any change in PC@ .

OBJECTIVE	Selenium supplementation for women infected with HIV may increase genital shedding of HIV-@ , however , to our knowledge , no studies have examined the effect on viral shedding in breast milk .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of selenium supplementation on HIV-@ RNA detection in breast milk of HIV-infected women .
METHODS	HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled at @ to @ wk gestation in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of daily selenium ( @ g as selenomethionine ) had cell-free HIV-@ RNA quantified in breast milk at @ to @ wk postpartum .
METHODS	All participants received high-dose multivitamins containing vitamin B complex , C , and E as standard of care .
RESULTS	The proportion of women with detectable ( > @ copies/mL ) HIV-@ RNA in breast milk appeared to be increased in the selenium group ( @ % ) compared with those in the placebo group ( @ % ) among the total cohort ( N = @ ) , but results were borderline statistically significant ( relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In secondary analyses , the proportion of women with detectable HIV-@ RNA in breast milk was significantly greater in the selenium group ( @ % ) compared with placebo group ( @ % ) among women who did not receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ; RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This relationship was primarily due to a significant effect of selenium among primiparous women ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) , but not multiparous women ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) ( P-value for interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	Too few women received HAART in this study ( n = @ ) to establish the effect of selenium supplementation .
CONCLUSIONS	Selenium supplementation appears to increase HIV-@ RNA detection in breast milk among primiparous women not receiving HAART .
CONCLUSIONS	Safety studies among pregnant women on HAART need to be conducted before administering selenium-containing supplements .

BACKGROUND	Up to @ % of patients suffer from long-term functional restrictions following conservative treatment of distal radius fractures .
BACKGROUND	Whether duration of cast immobilisation influences functional outcome remains unclear .
METHODS	The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the duration of immobilization of non or minimally displaced distal radial fractures can be safely reduced .
METHODS	We will compare three weeks of plaster cast immobilization with five weeks of plaster cast immobilization in adult patient with non or minimally displaced distal radial fractures .
METHODS	a prospective randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	adult ( > @ years ) ( independent in activities of daily living ) patients with a non/minimal displaced distal radius fracture ( dorsal angulation < @ , volar tilt < @ , radial inclination > @ , ulnar positive variance < @ mm and an articular step off < @ mm ) .
METHODS	three weeks of plaster cast immobilization versus five weeks of plaster cast immobilization.Main study parameters : primary outcome parameters : Patient related wrist evaluation ( PRWE ) Quick Disability of Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( QUICKDASH ) score after a one year follow-up , and secondary parameters : range of motion , pain level ( VAS ) and complications .
CONCLUSIONS	The expectation of this study is that shorter duration of plaster cast immobilisation is beneficial for the patient with a distal radius fracture .
CONCLUSIONS	This risk of specific complications is low and generally similar in both treatment options .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , the burden of the study is not much higher compared to standard treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Follow-up is standardized according to current trauma guidelines .
CONCLUSIONS	Literature indicates that both treatment options from the study are accepted for displaced distal radius fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	No clear advantage for one treatment options is found at present in the literature , although there is no level I evidence present .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial will provide level-@ evidence for the comparison of consolidation and functional outcome between two treatment options for non-displaced distal radial fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	The gathered data may support the development of a clinical guideline for conservative treatment of distal radial fractures .

BACKGROUND	The event-free survival of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) has been reported to be superior when oral methotrexate ( MTX ) and @-mercaptopurine ( @MP ) maintenance therapy ( MT ) is administered in the evening compared to the morning .
METHODS	In the ALL@ MT study we prospectively registered the intake of MTX/@MP .
METHODS	The registration was done when blood samples for erythrocyte MTX/@MP metabolite measurements were collected , and referred to the time of intake in the period since last registration .
METHODS	Nine thousand one hundred ninety-five registrations in total .
METHODS	The administration of MTX/@MP was scored as morning , midday , or evening .
RESULTS	Of @ patients , @ took their medication consistently in the evening , @ in the evening @-@ @ % of the time , and @ in the evening < @ % of the time , six did not have any registrations .
RESULTS	The circadian schedule did not differ significantly by age , sex , MTX/@MP doses , and average absolute neutrophil counts .
RESULTS	The circadian schedule groups did differ on risk groups ( P = @ ) with fewer HR patients in the @-@ @ % group , and there was a negative correlation between percentage of time on evening schedule and average WBC ( Spearman 's rho -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Average WBC was not associated with relapse on ALL@ .
RESULTS	In a Cox multivariate model the circadian schedule of MTX/@MP was not of prognostic significance for the risk of relapse , and the @-year cumulative relapse risk was below @ % in all groups .
CONCLUSIONS	An evening schedule may still be recommended based on the previous publications , but in this study morning administration of MTX and @MP does not seem to impact EFS .

OBJECTIVE	To quantify plasma concentrations and determine adverse ocular , renal , or hepatic effects associated with repeated topical ophthalmic application of @ % diclofenac to healthy cats .
METHODS	@ healthy sexually intact male cats .
METHODS	A randomized , placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted .
METHODS	A topical formulation of @ % diclofenac was administered @ times/d for @ days to @ cats , and artificial tear ( control ) solution was administered to the other @ cats .
METHODS	After a @-day washout period , cats received the other treatment .
METHODS	Ophthalmic examinations were performed daily .
METHODS	Plasma samples were obtained on days @ and @ for pharmacokinetic analysis .
METHODS	A CBC , serum biochemical analysis , urinalysis , determination of urine protein-to-creatinine ratio , and determination of glomerular filtration rate were performed before the start of the study and after each @-day treatment period .
RESULTS	Mild conjunctival hyperemia was the only adverse ocular effect detected .
RESULTS	Maximal drug concentration and area under the curve were significantly higher on day @ than on day @ .
RESULTS	Diclofenac-treated cats had a significantly lower glomerular filtration rate than did control-treated cats after the second but not after the first treatment period , presumably associated with iatrogenic hypovolemia .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical ophthalmic administration of @ % diclofenac was well tolerated in healthy cats , with only mild signs of ocular irritation .
CONCLUSIONS	Detectable systemic concentrations of diclofenac were achieved with accumulation over @ days .
CONCLUSIONS	Systemic absorption of diclofenac may be associated with reduced glomerular filtration rate , particularly in volume-contracted animals .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical ophthalmic @ % diclofenac should be used with caution in volume-contracted or systemically ill cats .

BACKGROUND	Mild primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) is a common disease especially in middle-aged and elderly women .
BACKGROUND	The diagnosis is frequently made incidentally and treatment strategies are widely discussed .
OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of parathyroidectomy ( PTX ) compared with observation ( OBS ) on biochemistry , safety , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and new fractures .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized controlled study ( SIPH study ) , with a @-year follow-up .
METHODS	The study was conducted at multicenter , tertiary referral centers .
METHODS	Of @ randomized patients with mild PHPT , biochemical data were available for @ patients after @ years , with a mean age at inclusion of @ years ( OBS group , @ males ) and @ years ( PTX group , @ males ) .
METHODS	Parathyroidectomy vs observation .
METHODS	Biochemistry , BMD , and new radiographic vertebral fractures .
RESULTS	Serum-calcium and PTH-levels normalized after surgery and did not deteriorate by observation .
RESULTS	BMD Z-scores were normal at inclusion in the lumbar spine ( LS ) and femoral neck ( FN ) .
RESULTS	For LS , BMD Z-scores were stable for @ years with observation , but decreased in FN ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	After surgery , BMD Z-scores increased significantly in both compartments ( P < @ for both ) , with a highly significant treatment effect of surgery compared to observation ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	During follow-up , five new clinically unrecognized vertebral fractures were found in @ females , all in the OBS group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Even though new vertebral fractures occurred only in the observation group , the frequency was not significantly different from the surgery group .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer follow-up is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the long-term safety of observation , as opposed to surgery .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this multicenter randomly controlled clinical trial was to compare two acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) materials produced by different processing techniques , freeze-dried ( FDADM ) and solvent-dehydrated ( SDADM ) ADM , in their ability to correct Miller Class I and II recession defects .
METHODS	Eighty individuals from four study centers , each with a single maxillary anterior Miller Class I or II recession defect were enrolled .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned and treated with coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) + FDADM ( n = @ ) or CAF + SDADM ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Gingival thickness , recession depth , recession width , probing depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level , gingival index , plaque index , patient discomfort , and wound healing index were recorded before surgery ( day @ ) , immediately after surgery ( day @ ) , and @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ weeks postoperatively .
METHODS	The Student t test , paired t test , and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data .
RESULTS	When evaluating the clinical parameters after @ year , both groups showed significant ( P < @ ) improvement for most of the parameters evaluated when compared to baseline ( day @ ) .
RESULTS	For example , percentage of root coverage was @ % @ % for CAF + FDADM and @ % @ % for CAF + SDADM .
RESULTS	Conversely , no significant differences were observed between the two materials for any clinical parameter tested or for patient satisfaction except PD on the mesial side of the defects ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both FDADM and SDADM can be used successfully to correct Miller Class I or II recession defects .
CONCLUSIONS	There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the clinical parameters tested .

BACKGROUND	Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) is being used more commonly in younger higher demand patients .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to explore a ) feasibility of comprehensive postoperative rehabilitation compared to usual care following primary THA in subjects < @ years , b ) appropriate outcome measures including performance-based measures and c ) timing of assessments .
METHODS	@ subjects who underwent primary THA were randomized to receive a three-month out-patient rehabilitation program ( Intervention ) or usual postoperative care ( Control ) .
METHODS	Subjects were assessed preoperatively , six-weeks postoperatively ( Pre-intervention ) and four and @ months postoperatively ( Post-intervention ) .
METHODS	Self-report measures were the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) and Rand @-Item Health Survey ( RAND-@ ) .
METHODS	Performance-based measures included lower extremity strength , walking speed and endurance , and gait laboratory assessment .
RESULTS	Ten Control and @ Intervention subjects with an average age of @ ( SD@ @ ) years were randomized .
RESULTS	All Intervention subjects completed the program without adverse effects .
RESULTS	Although no statistically significantly results were reported , four months postoperatively , Intervention subjects had clinically important differences ( CID ) in strength compared with Control subjects .
RESULTS	Walking endurance , WOMAC and RAND scores improved significantly with no CID noted between groups .
RESULTS	Ten ( @ % ) subjects reported a ceiling effect on the WOMAC ( @ ( @ % ) subjects on Pain ; @ ( @ % ) subject on Function ) .
RESULTS	No group CID were noted in gait measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Our recommendations would be that performance-based strength measures should be considered for the primary outcome in this younger cohort .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of the ceiling effects with WOMAC Pain , a different pain measure is indicated .
CONCLUSIONS	Other more challenging functional performance-based tests should be considered such as a more prolonged endurance test .
CONCLUSIONS	There is merit in one-year follow-up as strength improved after four months in both groups .

BACKGROUND	Long-term complications of cystic fibrosis include osteoporosis and fragility fractures , but few data are available about effective treatment strategies , especially in young patients .
BACKGROUND	We investigated treatment of low bone mineral density in children , adolescents , and young adults with cystic fibrosis .
METHODS	We did a multicentre trial in two phases .
METHODS	We enrolled patients aged @-@ years with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density , from ten cystic fibrosis regional centres in Italy .
METHODS	The first phase was an open-label , @-month observational study of the effect of adequate calcium intake plus calcifediol .
METHODS	The second phase was a @-month , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , parallel group study of the efficacy and safety of oral alendronate in patients whose bone mineral apparent density had not increased by @ % or more by the end of the observational phase .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to either alendronate or placebo .
METHODS	Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	We used dual x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and every @ months thereafter , corrected for body size , to assess lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density .
METHODS	We assessed bone turnover markers and other laboratory parameters every @-@ months .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was mean increase of lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density , assessed in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We screened @ patients and enrolled @ ( mean age @ years , SD @ , range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	In the observational phase , treatment with calcium and calcifediol increased bone mineral apparent density by @ % or more in @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	@ patients entered the randomised phase .
RESULTS	Bone mineral apparent density increased by @ % in the alendronate group ( n = @ ) versus @ % in the placebo group ( n = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ of @ young people ( @ % ) receiving alendronate attained a normal-for-age bone mineral apparent density Z score .
RESULTS	In the observational phase , five patients had moderate episodes of hypercalciuria , which resolved after short interruption of calcifediol treatment .
RESULTS	During the randomised phase , one patient taking alendronate had mild fever versus none in the placebo group ; treatment groups did not differ significantly for other adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Correct calcium intake plus calcifediol can improve bone mineral density in some young patients with cystic fibrosis .
CONCLUSIONS	In those who do not respond to calcium and calcifediol alone , alendronate can safely and effectively increase bone mineral density .

BACKGROUND	The optimal crystalloid solution to use perioperatively in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy remains unclear .
BACKGROUND	Many of the fluids used for intravenous hydration contain supraphysiologic concentrations of chloride , which can induce hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis , resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal function .
BACKGROUND	In addition , patients receiving less fluid and less sodium show faster recovery of gastrointestinal ( GI ) function after colonic surgery .
METHODS	This is an investigator-initiated , single-center , randomized , controlled , parallel group trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment , in the Department of Urology , University Hospital Bern , Switzerland .
METHODS	The study will involve @ patients with bladder cancer scheduled for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the duration between the end of surgery and the return of the GI function ( first defecation ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes are fluid balance ( body weight difference postoperatively versus preoperatively ) and the incidence of kidney function disorders according to the Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End Stage Renal Disease ( RIFLE classification ) .
METHODS	An equal number of patients are allocated to receive Ringerfundin solution or a glucose/potassium-based balanced crystalloid solution as baseline infusion during the entire time that intravenous administration of fluid is necessary during the perioperative period .
METHODS	The randomized crystalloid solution is infused at a rate of @ ml/kg/h until the bladder has been removed , followed by @ ml/kg/h until the end of surgery .
METHODS	Postoperative hydration is identical in both groups and consists of @,@ ml of the randomized crystalloid solution per @ hours .
METHODS	Postoperative patient care is identical in both groups ; patients are allowed to drink clear fluids immediately after surgery , and liquid diet is started on postoperative day @ , as well as active mobilization and the use of chewing gum .
METHODS	Body weight is measured daily in the morning .
METHODS	Time of first flatus and first defecation are recorded .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial assesses the benefits and harms of two different balanced crystalloid solutions for perioperative fluid management in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy with urinary diversion , with regard to return of GI function and effects on postoperative renal function .

OBJECTIVE	To determine clinical and demographic characteristics associated with antimuscarinic treatment response using a regression model .
METHODS	Adults with overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms for > @ months and @ urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) episode and @ micturitions per @ hours at baseline were randomized to fesoterodine ( @ mg ) , tolterodine extended-release ( @ mg ) , or placebo in two @-week , double-blind , head-to-head studies .
METHODS	Fesoterodine-treated patients received @ mg/d during the first week and @ mg/d thereafter .
METHODS	Patients completed @-day bladder diaries and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire at baseline and week @ .
METHODS	Pooled data for changes from baseline to week @ in winsorized UUI episodes , micturitions , and urgency episodes per @ hours and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Bother and health-related quality of life scores were analyzed posthoc using a regression model that selects outcome predictors from baseline values and patient characteristics while retaining baseline values and treatment , with stepwise inclusion of significant covariates and assessment of treatment interactions .
METHODS	Logistic regression was used for analysis of diary-dry rates .
RESULTS	Younger age , lack of previous antimuscarinic treatment , shorter duration of OAB diagnosis , and female gender were common predictors of larger changes in outcomes from baseline to week @ .
RESULTS	Baseline measures often interacted with treatment , such that poorer baseline outcomes were predictive of larger treatment differences .
RESULTS	Longer duration since OAB diagnosis predicted greater treatment differences for UUI episodes and in diary-dry rate , and increased age predicted greater treatment differences for micturitions .
CONCLUSIONS	Symptom severity and duration , age , gender , and previous antimuscarinic pharmacotherapy impact the response to antimuscarinic treatment .

BACKGROUND	Studies suggest that smokers present more or greater numbers of potential periodontal pathogens than non-smokers .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic effects of adjunctive aPDT on nonsurgical periodontal treatment in smokers with chronic periodontitis ( CP ) .
METHODS	Twenty smokers with CP had two contralateral teeth randomly assigned in a split-mouth design to receive SRP ( CG ) or SRP + a single episode of aPDT ( TG ) , with a diode laser and a phenothiazine photosensitizer .
METHODS	Levels of @ subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization at baseline and @ , @ and @ weeks after periodontal treatment .
RESULTS	All @ bacterial species evaluated were detected in different levels at baseline , with no statistic significant differences between groups .
RESULTS	After periodontal treatment , the levels of some bacterial species decreased , while some other species presented an increase .
RESULTS	Despite this variation , the statistical analysis was not able to identify significant differences neither at intragroup nor at intergroup comparisons .
CONCLUSIONS	Periodontal treatment with SRP or SRP + aPDT was not able to reduce levels of @ subgingival species in smokers with CP .
CONCLUSIONS	These outcomes indicate that smoking impairs periodontal healing after nonsurgical treatment even associated with aPDT .

METHODS	This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised , multiple-ascending-dose , up-titration study .
METHODS	Male subjects received increasing oral doses of selexipag ( @-@ ,@ g ; n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) twice daily for @ days each , using incremental steps of @ g between each dose level .
METHODS	Standard safety and tolerability data were collected .
METHODS	Blood samples were taken to assess the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite ACT-@ and possible effects on platelet aggregation .
RESULTS	Dose levels of selexipag up to @,@ g were well tolerated and this dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose .
RESULTS	Plasma exposure to ACT-@ was approximately @ times higher than that to selexipag .
RESULTS	Steady-state conditions for both compounds were reached on day @ of each dose level , and no accumulation of selexipag or ACT-@ was observed .
RESULTS	Based on the area under the curve and the maximum plasma concentration , the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and ACT-@ were dose proportional .
RESULTS	At the highest dose level , the geometric mean terminal half-life of selexipag and ACT-@ was @ and @ h , respectively .
RESULTS	The observed effects on platelet aggregation were variable without obvious drug - or dose-dependent pattern .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of increasing doses of selexipag was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	The present results support the conduct of future clinical trials .

BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to compare the costs and outcomes of two sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) screening interventions targeted at men in football club settings in England , including screening promoted by team captains .
METHODS	A comparison of costs and outcomes was undertaken alongside a pilot cluster randomised control trial involving three trial arms : ( @ ) captain-led and poster STI screening promotion ; ( @ ) sexual health advisor-led and poster STI screening promotion and ( @ ) poster-only STI screening promotion ( control/comparator ) .
METHODS	For all study arms , resource use and cost data were collected prospectively .
RESULTS	There was considerable variation in uptake rates between clubs , but results were broadly comparable across study arms with @ % of men accepting the screening offer in the captain-led arm , @ % in the sexual health advisor-led arm and @ % in the poster-only control arm .
RESULTS	The overall costs associated with the intervention arms were similar .
RESULTS	The average cost per player tested was comparable , with the average cost per player tested for the captain-led promotion estimated to be @ compared with @ for the sexual health advisor-led promotion and @ for the poster-only ( control ) arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Costs and outcomes were similar across intervention arms .
CONCLUSIONS	The target sample size was not achieved , and we found a greater than anticipated variability between clubs in the acceptability of screening , which limited our ability to estimate acceptability for intervention arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Further evidence is needed about the public health benefits associated with screening interventions in non-clinical settings so that their cost-effectiveness can be fully evaluated .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the regulatory effects of established Chinese herbal formulas on inflammatory mediators released during asthma attacks , and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the treatment of asthma .
METHODS	Seventy-five asthmatic children were randomly divided into a Chinese medication group ( @ cases ) and a Western medication control group ( @ cases ) .
METHODS	Patients in the Chinese medication group were treated with a series of established Chinese herbal formulas , whereas the Western medication control group received a leukotriene receptor antagonist and a bronchial relaxant .
METHODS	Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of interleukin ( IL ) -@ , cysteinyl leukotriene receptor @ ( CysLTR@ ) , and interferon ( IFN ) - gamma in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after treatment .
METHODS	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the peripheral blood levels of IL-@ , leukotriene ( LTE ) -@ , and INF-gamma before and after treatment .
RESULTS	After treatment , the mRNA expression levels of IL-@ and CysLTR@ were down-regulated ( P < @ ) and the mRNA expression levels of IFN-gamma were up-regulated ( P < @ ) in the Chinese medication and Western medication groups ; no significant difference was found between the two groups .
RESULTS	In the Chinese medication group , IL-@ blood level was decreased and it was significantly different from that in the Western medication group ( P < @ ) ; there was also a significant increase in IFN-gamma blood levels after treatment with Chinese medication ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in LTE-@ blood levels between the two groups before and after treatment ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Chinese medication has a regulatory effect on leukotriene receptor gene expression and the imbalance of Th@/Th@ immune cells during asthma attacks in pediatric patients .

OBJECTIVE	To determine inter-rater reliability in identifying a knee extension lag using the sitting active and prone passive lag test ( SAPLT ) .
METHODS	@ patients with a diagnosis of knee pain were randomly assigned and independently examined by two physical therapists at a time , to determine the presence of an active or a passive extension lag at the knee .
METHODS	An active lag was determined by the inability of the erectly seated subject to actively extend the involved knee in maximal dorsiflexion of the ankle to the same level as the normal knee held in maximal extension and ankle in maximal dorsiflexion , as seen by the levels of the toes .
METHODS	A passive lag was determined by placing the subject prone with the knees just past the edge of the table and determining the high position of the heel in a fully resting extension position compared to the heel on the normal side .
RESULTS	For the sitting active lag test , the inter-rater reliability was ` good ' ( Kappa @ , SE of kappa @ , @ % confidence interval ) .
RESULTS	For the prone passive lag test , the inter-rater reliability was ` good ' ( Kappa @ , SE of kappa @ , @ % confidence interval ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The SAPLT may be incorporated as a simple yet effective test to determine the presence of a knee extension lag .
CONCLUSIONS	It identifies the type of restraint , active , passive or both , and is suggestive of the most appropriate management .

BACKGROUND	In a large cluster-randomized trial on the impact of a prediction model , presenting the calculated risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) on-screen ( assistive approach ) increased the administration of risk-dependent PONV prophylaxis by anaesthetists .
BACKGROUND	This change in therapeutic decision-making did not improve the patient outcome ; that is , the incidence of PONV .
BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to quantify the effects of adding a specific therapeutic recommendation to the predicted risk ( directive approach ) on PONV prophylaxis decision-making and the incidence of PONV .
METHODS	A prospective before-after study was conducted in @ elective surgical inpatients .
METHODS	The before-period included care-as-usual and the after-period included the directive risk-based ( intervention ) strategy .
METHODS	Risk-dependent effects on the administered number of prophylactic antiemetics and incidence of PONV were analysed by mixed-effects regression analysis .
RESULTS	During the intervention period anaesthetists administered @ -LSB- @ % confidence intervals ( CIs ) : @-@ @ -RSB- more antiemetics for patients identified as being at greater risk of PONV .
RESULTS	This directive approach led to a reduction in PONV -LSB- odds ratio ( OR ) : @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , with an even greater reduction in PONV in high-risk patients ( OR : @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Anaesthetists administered more prophylactic antiemetics when a directive approach was used for risk-tailored intervention compared with care-as-usual .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast to the previously studied assistive approach , the increase in PONV prophylaxis now resulted in a lower PONV incidence , particularly in high-risk patients .
CONCLUSIONS	When one aims for a truly ` PONV-free hospital ' , a more liberal use of prophylactic antiemetics must be accepted and lower-risk thresholds should be set for the actionable recommendations .

OBJECTIVE	Several field triage systems have been developed to rapidly sort patients following a mass casualty incident ( MCI ) .
OBJECTIVE	JumpSTART ( Simple Triage and Rapid Transport ) is a pediatric-specific MCI triage system .
OBJECTIVE	SALT ( Sort , Assess , Lifesaving interventions , Treat/Transport ) has been proposed as a new national standard for MCI triage for both adult and pediatric patients , but it has not been tested in a pediatric population .
OBJECTIVE	This pilot study hypothesizes that SALT is at least as good as JumpSTART in triage accuracy , speed , and ease of use in a simulated pediatric MCI .
METHODS	Paramedics were invited and randomly assigned to either SALT or JumpSTART study groups .
METHODS	Following randomization , subjects viewed a @-minute PowerPoint lecture on either JumpSTART or SALT .
METHODS	Subjects were provided with a triage algorithm card for reference and were asked to assign triage categories to @ pediatric patients in a simulated building collapse .
METHODS	The scenario consisted of @ children in moulage and @ high-fidelity pediatric simulators .
METHODS	Injuries and triage categories were based on a previously published MCI scenario .
METHODS	One investigator followed each subject to record time and triage assignment .
METHODS	All subjects completed a post-test survey and structured interview following the simulated disaster .
RESULTS	Forty-three paramedics were enrolled .
RESULTS	Seventeen were assigned to the SALT group with an overall triage accuracy of @ % @ % , an overtriage mean rate of @ @ % , and an undertriage rate of @ @ % .
RESULTS	Twenty-six participants were assigned to the JumpSTART group with an overall accuracy of @ @ % , an overtriage mean of @ @ % , and an undertriage rate of @ @ % .
RESULTS	Ease of use was not statistically different between the two systems ( median Likert value of both systems = @ , p = @ ) Time to triage per patient was statistically faster in the JumpSTART group ( SALT = @ @ seconds , JumpSTART = @ @ seconds , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both systems were prone to cognitive and affective error .
CONCLUSIONS	SALT appears to be at least as good as JumpSTART in overall triage accuracy , overtriage , or undertriage rates in a simulated pediatric MCI .
CONCLUSIONS	Both systems were considered easy to use .
CONCLUSIONS	However , JumpSTART was @ seconds faster per patient in time taken to assign triage designations .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the clinical efficacy and effect mechanism on chronic urticaria treated with moving cupping therapy combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints .
METHODS	One hundred and four patients of chronic urticaria were randomized into a comprehensive therapy group and a medication group , @ cases in each one .
METHODS	In the comprehensive therapy group , the moving cupping therapy along the governor vessel and bladder meridian of foot-taiyang was applied combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints .
METHODS	The self-venous blood was injected at bilateral Quchi ( LI @ ) and Zusanli ( ST @ ) , @ mL at each acupoint , once every @ days .
METHODS	In the medication group , cetirizine tablets , @ mg were prescribed for oral administration , once every day , and the compound dexamethasone acetate cream was used externally , once to twice a day .
METHODS	The clinical efficacy : was observed in @ days of treatment in the two groups .
METHODS	The changes of serum interleukin @ ( IL-@ ) and immunoglobulin E ( Ig E ) before and after treatment were observed .
METHODS	The recurrence rate was compared between the two groups in @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	The cured and markedly effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the comprehensive therapy group , which was higher obviously than @ % ( @/@ , P < @ ) in the medication group .
RESULTS	The levels of serum IL-@ and IgE were reduced in the patients of the two groups , indicating the significant difference in comparison before and after treatment ( all P < @ ) and the reducing degree in the comprehensive therapy group was much more significant than that in the medicine group ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The recurrence rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the comprehensive therapy group in the @-month follow-up after treatment , and apparently lower than @ % ( @/@ , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The moving cupping therapy combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints achieves the better efficacy on chronic urticaria compared with the routine western medicine treatment and the recurrence rate is low .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect mechanism is possibly related to the down-regulation of serum IL-@ and IgE in the patients .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the clinical effect of slow-rapid reinforcing-reducing needling manipulation at Jiaji ( EX-B @ ) acupoint for lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion .
METHODS	Sixty subjects met the inclusion criteria of disc herniation were randomly divided into treatment group ( n = @ ) and control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	In the treatment group , the stimulation mode ( slow or fast , reinforcement or reduction ) of Jiaji acupoints ( EX-B @ ) was based on the status of the patients by an overall analysis of symptoms and signs .
METHODS	Other acupoints such as Huantiao ( GB @ ) , Weizhong ( BL @ ) , etc. were stimulated with uniform reinforcing-reducing manipulation .
METHODS	In the control group , all the acupoints were stimulated in uniform reinforcing-reducing mode .
METHODS	The treatment was conducted once a day , continuously for @ days with @ day 's break between every @ days .
METHODS	The clinical efficacy appraisal , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and Japanese orthopaedic association ( JOA ) scores and traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) syndrome scores were used for outcome assessment .
RESULTS	In comparison with pretreatment , the VAS scores and TCM syndrome scores were significantly decreased in both control and treatment groups ( P < @ ) , and the JOA scores were markedly increased after the treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The therapeutic effects of the treatment group were obviously superior to those of the control group in down-regulating the VAS score and TCM syndome score and up-regulating JOA score ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Slow-fast reinforcing-reducing needling manipulation is superior to the routine acupuncture in the management of lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion .

BACKGROUND	There are limited clinical experiments addressing the effects of photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) as an adjunct to conventional scaling and root planing ( SRP ) on clinical and biologic features of periodontitis .
BACKGROUND	This trial compares the clinical parameters and cytokine profiles in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis ( CP ) who have been treated using SRP alone or SRP + PDT .
METHODS	Twenty-two patients with two contralateral teeth affected with moderate-to-severe CP were selected .
METHODS	After SRP , the participants ' teeth were randomized to receive either no further treatment or a single application of PDT using a @-nm laser and toluidine blue .
METHODS	Although the change in probing depth was the primary outcome , bleeding on probing , clinical attachment level , gingival recession , interleukin-@ , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - , and matrix metalloproteinase @ and @ were also evaluated at baseline and @ months postintervention .
METHODS	An oral rinse assay was also performed to determine the total levels of oral polymorphonuclear cells ( PMNs ) before and @ months after the treatments .
RESULTS	Within each group , significant improvements ( P < @ ) were found for all variables in @-month follow-up compared with baseline .
RESULTS	Only TNF - was significantly improved in the PDT + SRP versus SRP group .
RESULTS	Total levels of PMNs were reduced for all patients compared with baseline levels ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with CP , a single application of PDT ( using a @-nm laser and toluidine blue ) did not provide any additional benefit to SRP in terms of clinical parameters or inflammatory markers @ months following the intervention .

BACKGROUND	The EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool ( EXACT ) is a patient-reported outcome measure to standardize the symptomatic assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations , including reported and unreported events .
BACKGROUND	The instrument has been validated in a short-term study of patients with acute exacerbation and stable disease ; its performance in longer-term studies has not been assessed .
OBJECTIVE	To test the EXACT 's performance in three randomized controlled trials and describe the relationship between resource-defined medically treated exacerbations ( MTEs ) and symptom ( EXACT ) - defined events .
METHODS	Prespecified secondary analyses of data from phase II randomized controlled trials testing new drugs for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease : one @-month trial ( United States ) ( n = @ ) and two @-month , multinational trials ( AZ @ -LSB- n = @ -RSB- , AZ @ -LSB- n = @ -RSB- ) .
METHODS	In each case , the experimental drugs were found to be ineffective , permitting assessment of the EXACT 's performance in three independent studies of moderate to severe high-risk patients on maintenance therapies .
RESULTS	The mean age of subjects was @ to @ years ; @ to @ % were male .
RESULTS	Mean FEV@ % predicted was @ to @ % .
RESULTS	EXACT scores exhibited internal consistency ( Cronbach 's @ ) , reproducibility ( intraclass correlation @ ) , correlation with St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( Spearman rho -LSB- rs -RSB- = @ , @ , @ in the three trials ; P < @ ) , and Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale ( AZ @ , rs = @ ; AZ @ , rs = @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	EXACT-defined events had a high correspondence with alternative indicators of worsening ( @ , @ , and @ % ) .
RESULTS	In each trial , unreported events were similar in severity ( mean EXACT score , @ , @ , @ vs. @ , @ -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , @ -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , respectively ; @-point scale ) and longer ( median , @ , @ , @ vs. @ , @ -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , @ days , respectively ) than moderate MTEs .
CONCLUSIONS	Data generated through the EXACT offers insight into the symptomatic nature of MTEs and the frequency , severity , and duration of unreported symptom-defined events .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trials registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( MPEX : NCT@ ; AZ @ : NCT@ ; AZ @ : NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Complex regional pain syndrome is multifactorial .
BACKGROUND	Exaggerated inflammatory responses to limb injury may be involved .
BACKGROUND	The authors hypothesized that capsaicin-induced pain and neurogenic inflammation ( skin perfusion and flare area ) are increased in patients with complex regional pain syndrome compared with that in controls .
METHODS	Twenty patients with unilateral upper-limb complex regional pain syndrome and @ age - , sex - , and body mass index-matched controls participated .
METHODS	Topical capsaicin @ % was applied to the back of both hands for @ min , and pain intensity was assessed on a visual analogue scale .
METHODS	A laser Doppler perfusion imager scanner estimated capsaicin-induced skin perfusion and flare area .
METHODS	Autonomic and small-fiber function was assessed by sensory testing , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and vasoconstrictor responses .
RESULTS	The authors found bilateral hypersensitivity to capsaicin ( P @ ) , skin fold ( P = @ ) , joint pressure ( P < @ ) , cold ( P @ ) , and heat pain ( P @ ) in patients compared with that in controls and thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in the complex regional pain syndrome-affected hand compared with that in the unaffected hand ( P @ ) .
RESULTS	The patients had normal capsaicin-induced flare areas , thermal detection thresholds , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and vasoconstrictor responses .
CONCLUSIONS	The main finding is bilaterally increased capsaicin-induced pain in patients compared with controls .
CONCLUSIONS	The flare response to capsaicin was normal , suggesting that the increased pain response was not due to increased neurogenic inflammation .
CONCLUSIONS	The bilateral hypersensitivity to painful chemical , thermal , and mechanical stimuli not confined to the innervation area of a peripheral nerve or root can not be explained by a regional change and may partly be due to central sensitization .

BACKGROUND	Diurnal variation in serum growth hormone ( s-GH ) levels after exogenous GH delivery has previously been reported in patients with no endogenous GH secretion .
BACKGROUND	Changes in postural position or physical activity , leading to changes in blood flow and/or lymphatic drainage may be underlying explanations .
OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of this study is to study a possible impact of exercise and supine rest on pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and day-to-day variation of subcutaneously ( s.c. ) administered GH in adult GH deficient ( AGHD ) patients .
OBJECTIVE	The secondary aim of this study is to compare s-IGF-I , s-insulin , and plasma ( p ) - glucose profiles after a carbohydrate rich breakfast following s.c. GH injection vs. continuous infusion .
METHODS	During supine rest eight AGHD males ( @ years , BMI @ kg/m ( @ ) ) were treated with one daily s.c. GH injections of @ mg/@ h for @ h ( treatment sessions A , B ) or a continuous s.c. GH infusion of @ mg/@ h for @ h ( treatment sessions C , D ) .
METHODS	Exercise comprised @ h bicycling with @ W load on two consecutive days during treatment sessions B and D.
RESULTS	Administration of GH as a bolus injection , but not as a continuous GH infusion , resulted in about @ % higher s-GH levels during exercise ( @ min ) as well as @ min after ( s-GH logAUC ( B-A ) difference was @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the total s-GH ( AUC @-@ h ) ( p = @ ) and s-IGF-I ( AUC@-@ h ) levels ( p = @ ) remained unchanged between the two occasions .
RESULTS	P-glucose and insulin profiles were significantly higher after carbohydrate rich breakfast before first and second dosing both following s.c. GH injection and continuous infusion ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Moderate exercise intermittently increased s-GH levels .
CONCLUSIONS	These changes seem to have no clinical short-term relevance , since total s-GH ( @ h ) and s-IGF-I ( @ h ) levels were unaffected .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this prospective , randomised study was to evaluate long-term clinical results , radiographic findings , complications and revision and survivorship rates in patients < @ years at a minimum of @ years after undergoing bilateral , sequential , simultaneous , cemented and cementless total knee arthroplasties ( TKAs ) in the same patients .
METHODS	Bilateral , sequential , simultaneous TKAs were performed in @ patients ( @ knees ) .
METHODS	There were @ women and @ men with a mean age of @ years ( range @-@ ) , who received a cementless prosthesis in one knee and a cemented prosthesis in the other .
METHODS	The mean follow-up was @ years ( range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	At final review , the mean Knee Society ( KS ) knee scores ( @ versus @ ) , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ( WOMAC ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) index ( @ versus @ ) , range of motion ( ROM ) ( @ versus @ ) , patient satisfaction ( @ versus @ ) and radiological results were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	Femoral component survival rate was @ % in both groups at @ years ; at @ years , the cemented tibial component survival rate was @ % and the cementless tibial component @ % .
RESULTS	No osteolysis was identified in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term results of both cementless and cemented TKAs were encouraging in patients with OA who were < @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	However , we found no evidence to prove the superiority of cementless over cemented TKAs .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the relationship between session-by-session mediators and treatment outcomes in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and acceptance and commitment therapy ( ACT ) for social anxiety disorder .
METHODS	Session-by-session changes in negative cognitions ( a theorized mediator of CBT ) and experiential avoidance ( a theorized mediator of ACT ) were assessed in @ adult outpatients randomized to CBT ( n = @ ) or ACT ( n = @ ) for DSM-IV social anxiety disorder .
RESULTS	Multilevel modeling analyses revealed significant nonlinear decreases in the proposed mediators in both treatments , with ACT showing steeper decline than CBT at the beginning of treatment and CBT showing steeper decline than ACT at the end of treatment .
RESULTS	Curvature ( or the nonlinear effect ) of experiential avoidance during treatment significantly mediated posttreatment social anxiety symptoms and anhedonic depression in ACT , but not in CBT , with steeper decline of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire at the beginning of treatment predicting fewer symptoms in ACT only .
RESULTS	Curvature of negative cognitions during both treatments predicted outcome , with steeper decline of negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment predicting lower posttreatment social anxiety and depressive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Rate of change in negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment is an important predictor of change across both ACT and CBT , whereas rate of change in experiential avoidance at the beginning of treatment is a mechanism specific to ACT .

BACKGROUND	Although the benefits of physical activity ( PA ) on to prevent and manage non-communicable diseases are well known , strategies to help increase the levels of PA among different populations are limited .
BACKGROUND	Exercise-referral schemes have emerged as one effective approach to promote PA ; however , there is uncertainty about the feasibility and effectiveness of these schemes in settings outside high-income countries .
BACKGROUND	This study will examine the effectiveness of a scheme to refer hypertensive patients identified in Primary Health Care facilities ( PHCU ) of the Mexican social security institution to a group PA program offered in the same institution .
METHODS	We will describe the methods of a cluster randomized trial study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise referral scheme to increasing physical activity in hypertensive patients compared to a non-referral scheme .
METHODS	Four PHCU were selected for the study ; the PHCU will take part as the unit of randomization and sedentary hypertensive patients as the unit of assessment .
METHODS	@ PHCU of control group ( GC ) will provide information to hypertensive patients about physical activity benefits and ways to increase it safely .
METHODS	@ PHCU of intervention group ( IG ) will refer patients to sports facilities at the same institution , to follow a group-based PA program developed to increase the PA levels with a designed based on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory .
METHODS	To evaluate the effects of the intervention as well as short-term maintenance of the intervention 's effects , PA will be assessed at baseline , at @ and @ weeks of follow-up .
METHODS	The main outcome will be the difference before and after intervention in the percentage of participants meeting recommended levels of PA between and within intervention and control groups .
METHODS	PA will be measured through self-report and with objective measure by accelerometer .
CONCLUSIONS	This study will allow us to evaluate a multidisciplinary effort to link the primary care and community-based areas of the same health care system .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings will provide important information about the feasibility and effectiveness of an exercise-referral scheme and will be useful for decision-making about the implementation of strategies for increasing PA among hypertensive and other clinical populations in Mexico and Latin America .

OBJECTIVE	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients display high levels of oxidative stress .
OBJECTIVE	Transient exercise-induced increases in oxidative stress are thought to be adaptive in healthy populations .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the effect of exercise on markers of oxidative stress in RA , following acute exercise and a period of exercise training .
METHODS	Acute exercise study : RA patients ( N = @ , age : @ ) undertook a bout of exercise ( @-@min , @ % VO@MAX ) , and blood samples were taken before and after exercise to assess markers of oxidative stress .
METHODS	Training study : RA patients ( N = @ , age : @ ) were randomised into either a control or exercise group , who undertook @ exercise sessions per week ( @-@min @ @ % VO@MAX ) for @months .
METHODS	Plasma markers of oxidative stress ( protein carbonyls ( PC ) , lipid hydroperoxides ( LOOH ) , @-nitrotyrosine ( @-NT ) , total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) and catalase ( CAT ) activity ) , inflammation ( interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ) and nitric oxide metabolites ( NOx ) were assessed before and after training .
RESULTS	Acute exercise study : Protein carbonyls ( PC ) ( +@ % ) and NOx ( +@ % ) were significantly increased following exercise .
RESULTS	Training study : @-nitrotyrosine ( @-NT ) decreased ( @ to @ M ) in the exercise group only , alongside increases in aerobic fitness ( @ to @ ml/kg/min ( -@ ) ) and reductions in disease activity score ( DAS : @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	PC , LOOH , TAC , IL-@ , CRP and NOx concentrations , and CAT activity were unchanged in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Aerobic exercise training did not increase markers of oxidative stress in RA patients .
CONCLUSIONS	@-Nitrotyrosine and disease activity were decreased following exercise training .

BACKGROUND	The application of internet technology for telerehabilitation in patients with stroke has developed rapidly .
OBJECTIVE	The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a bidirectional and multi-user telerehabilitation system on balance and satisfaction in patients with chronic stroke living in long-term care facilities ( LTCFs ) .
METHODS	This pilot study used a multi-site , blocked randomization design .
METHODS	Twenty-four participants from three LTCFs were recruited , and the participants were randomly assigned into the telerehabilitation ( Tele ) and conventional therapy ( Conv ) groups within each LTCF .
METHODS	Tele group received telerehabilitation but the Conv group received conventional therapy with two persons in each group for three sessions per week and for four weeks .
METHODS	The outcome measures included Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , Barthel Index ( BI ) , and the telerehabilitation satisfaction of the participants .
METHODS	A telerehabilitation system included `` therapist end '' in a laboratory , and the `` client end '' in LTCFs .
METHODS	The conventional therapy was conducted in LTCFs .
RESULTS	Training programs conducted for both the Tele and Conv groups showed significant effects within groups on the participant BBS as well as the total and self-care scores of BI .
RESULTS	No significant difference between groups could be demonstrated .
RESULTS	The satisfaction of participants between the Tele and the Conv groups also did not show significant difference .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study indicated that the multi-user telerehabilitation program is feasible for improving the balance and functional activity similar to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke living in LTCFs .

BACKGROUND	The reward value of food is partly dependent on learned associations .
BACKGROUND	It is not yet known whether replacing sugar with non-caloric sweeteners in food is affecting long-term acceptance .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of replacing sugar with non-caloric sweeteners in a nutrient-empty drink ( soft drink ) versus nutrient-rich drink ( yoghurt drink ) on reward value after repeated exposure .
METHODS	We used a randomized crossover design whereby forty subjects ( @ men , @ women ) with a mean SD age of @ @ y and BMI of @ @ kg/m ( @ ) consumed a fixed portion of a non-caloric sweetened ( NS ) and sugar sweetened ( SS ) versions of either a soft drink or a yoghurt drink ( counterbalanced ) for breakfast which were distinguishable by means of colored labels .
METHODS	Each version of a drink was offered @ times in semi-random order .
METHODS	Before and after conditioning the reward value of the drinks was assessed using behavioral tasks on wanting , liking , and expected satiety .
METHODS	In a subgroup ( n = @ ) fMRI was performed to assess brain reward responses to the drinks .
RESULTS	Outcomes of both the behavioral tasks and fMRI showed that conditioning did not affect the reward value of the NS and SS versions of the drinks significantly .
RESULTS	Overall , subjects preferred the yoghurt drinks to the soft drinks and the ss drinks to the NS drinks .
RESULTS	In addition , they expected the yoghurt drinks to be more satiating , they reduced hunger more , and delayed the first eating episode more .
RESULTS	Conditioning did not influence these effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study showed that repeated consumption of a non-caloric sweetened beverage , instead of a sugar sweetened version , appears not to result in changes in the reward value .
CONCLUSIONS	It can not be ruled out that learned associations between sensory attributes and food satiating capacity which developed preceding the conditioning period , during lifetime , affected the reward value of the drinks .

OBJECTIVE	We test the hypothesis that anesthesia , measured as pain scores , induced by a novel topical anesthetic putty is non-inferior ( margin = @ ) to that provided by conventional lidocaine infiltration for the repair of lacerations .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department ( ED ) of a local hospital .
METHODS	Participants were randomly allocated to receive either infiltration anesthesia or topical anesthetic putty as per the trial protocol .
METHODS	Pain scores were recorded @ minutes after infiltration and @ minutes after topical anesthetic putty application .
METHODS	Median pain scores were compared between groups .
METHODS	Wound evaluation scores were conducted after @ to @ days and adverse events were monitored for both groups of participants throughout the study .
RESULTS	One hundred and ten participants were enrolled in the study , with @ receiving infiltration and @ receiving topical anesthetic putty .
RESULTS	The median difference between the pain scores of the @ groups was @ ( @ % confidence interval -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no substantial differences between the @ groups in terms of either the wound evaluation scores or the incidence of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	The novel topical anesthetic putty was not inferior to infiltration with lidocaine with respect to the pain experienced during suturing , and this putty is a feasible alternative to infiltration anesthesia of lacerations in the ED .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the value of preoperative evaluation with three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography ( @D-EAUS ) for anal fistula in order to provide preoperative assessment for anal fistula .
METHODS	One hundred patients diagnosed with anal fistula undergoing surgery between March @ and March @ in our department were prospectively enrolled .
METHODS	All the patients were randomly divided into the ultrasound group and the control group with fifty patients in each group .
METHODS	The ultrasound group received @D-EAUS and the control group received routine examinations ( digital examination and probe ) to assess the position of the internal opening , the type of fistula and secondary tracks , respectively .
METHODS	The concordance rate of the preoperative assessment and intraoperative exploration was evaluated between the two groups .
RESULTS	The accuracy of identifying internal opening was @ % for the ultrasound group and @ % for the control group with statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The accuracy of identifying internal opening for simple anal fistula was similar ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For complex anal fistula , the accuracy was also higher in the ultrasound group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The accuracy of fistula classification was @ % for the ultrasound group and @ % for the control group with significant difference ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The accuracy of identifying a second track was higher in the ultrasound group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It is significantly superior for @D-EAUS to detect the internal opening , fistula classification and identification of a second track in complex anal fistulas as compared to conventional examination .
CONCLUSIONS	@D-EAUS should be recommended as a preoperative assessment for anal fistula , especially for complex one .

OBJECTIVE	The quality of integrated diabetes care is important for reducing the burden of diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , we have evaluated the effect of a supervision program on the quality of integrated diabetes care in the Netherlands in the @-@ period .
METHODS	In this cluster RCT , the supervision program was assigned to randomly selected care groups providing care to diabetes patients .
METHODS	The supervision program included announcements of inspections , site visits , and sending individualized reports .
METHODS	Indicators of effectiveness were derived from the structures , processes , and outcomes of care .
METHODS	These indicators were collected from patients ' files , before and after the supervision program .
METHODS	Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze data from @ patients of @ intervention and @ control care groups .
RESULTS	Structures and processes of care did not improve more in the intervention groups than in the control care groups .
RESULTS	Moreover , health outcomes did not improve more in the intervention groups than in the control care groups .
RESULTS	Although structures of care improved over time in the total population of intervention and control care groups , there were no changes in process of care or health outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	In this cluster RCT , we could not demonstrate improvements in quality of integrated diabetes care resulting from the supervision program .
CONCLUSIONS	Although structures of care did improve over time , other quality-improvement initiatives are necessary to substantially strengthen integrated care for diabetes patients .

BACKGROUND	Following a major burn , skeletal muscle protein synthesis rate increases but is often insufficient to compensate for massively elevated muscle protein breakdown rates .
BACKGROUND	Given the long-term nature of the pathophysiologic response to burn injury , we hypothesized that muscle protein synthesis rate would be chronically elevated in severely burned children .
BACKGROUND	The objectives of this study were to characterize muscle protein synthesis rate of burned children over a period of @ months after injury and to identify predictors that influence this response .
METHODS	A total of @ children with @ % or greater total body surface area ( TBSA ) burned were included .
METHODS	Patients participated in stable isotope infusion studies at @ , @ , and approximately @ weeks after burn and at @ , @ , and @ months after injury to determine skeletal muscle protein fractional synthesis rate .
METHODS	Generalized estimating equations with log link normal distribution were applied to account for clustering of patients and control for patient characteristics .
RESULTS	Patients ( @ @ years ) had large ( @ , @-@ % TBSA ) and deep ( @ % @ % TBSA third degree ) burns .
RESULTS	Muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was elevated throughout the first @ months after burn compared with established values from healthy young adults .
RESULTS	Muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was lower in boys , in children older than @ years , and when burns were greater than @ % TBSA .
CONCLUSIONS	Muscle protein synthesis is elevated for at least @ year after injury , suggesting that greater muscle protein turnover is a component of the long-term pathophysiologic response to burn trauma .
CONCLUSIONS	Muscle protein synthesis is highly affected by sex , age , and burn size in severely burned children .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may explain the divergence in net protein balance and lean body mass in different populations of burn patients .
METHODS	Prognostic study , level III .

BACKGROUND	In this study , we evaluated long-term survival in patients treated with and without mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP ) before colorectal surgery for cancer .
METHODS	Long-term outcome of patients of @ main participating hospitals in a prior multicenter randomized trial comparing clinical outcome of MBP versus no MBP was reviewed .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was cancer-related mortality and secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients underwent potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer .
RESULTS	One hundred seventy-seven ( @ % ) patients were treated with MBP and @ ( @ % ) were not before surgery .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ years ( mean @ , range @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in both cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality in patients treated with MBP and without MBP ( P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis , taking account of age , sex , AJCC cancer stage , and ASA classification , also showed no survival difference .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results indicate that MBP does not seem to influence long-term survival in patients surgically treated for colorectal cancer .

BACKGROUND	Applying appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) to corresponding intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) can improve gas exchange during capnoperitoneum without any hemodynamic effects .
METHODS	A total of @ patients were randomly allocated to group @PEEP ( n = @ ) , group @PEEP ( n = @ ) , and group @PEEP ( n = @ ) according to the level of PEEP , in whom capnoperitoneum was created with IAP of @ , @ , and @ mm Hg , respectively .
METHODS	Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were recorded up to @ minutes after capnoperitoneum .
RESULTS	In @PEEP group , mean end-tidal carbon dioxide demonstrated significant rise @ minutes after capnoperitoneum and plateaued at about @ minutes but remained at high level for up to @ minutes when compared with the @PEEP and @PEEP groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Correspondingly , the mean PaCO@ ( @ mm Hg ) for the @PEEP group was higher at @ minutes when compared with @PEEP ( @ mm Hg ) and @PEEP ( @ mm Hg ) groups .
RESULTS	The oxygenation was better preserved in @PEEP and @PEEP groups with significantly higher PaO@/Fio@ ratio .
RESULTS	Heart rate , mean arterial pressure , and cardiac output remained stable throughout the study in all the @ groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Application of appropriate PEEP corresponding to the IAP helped maintain CO@ elimination and improved oxygenation without any hemodynamic disturbance in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy .

OBJECTIVE	Isoflavones are present in soy foods and soy-based supplements .
OBJECTIVE	Despite low plasma isoflavone concentrations in the general Western population , concentrations in supplement users exceed those suggested to be beneficial for health in Asian populations , raising concerns for adverse effects .
OBJECTIVE	To aid risk assessment , quantification of the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations is essential .
METHODS	Plasma samples were collected from postmenopausal women in three placebo-controlled crossover studies with @-week periods for supplements ( two studies , ~ @mg isoflavones/day , n = @ ) or @-week periods for soy foods ( one study , ~ @mg isoflavones/day , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Plasma isoflavone concentrations ( daidzein , equol , genistein and glycitein ) were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection .
METHODS	The association between plasma concentrations and isoflavone intake , equol producer status , intake-producer interaction and background dietary intake was assessed based on the assumption of a log-linear relation .
RESULTS	Median plasma total isoflavone concentrations after the soy food and supplement interventions were respectively @ and @ mol/l for equol producers and @ and @ mol/l for non-producers .
RESULTS	Regression analysis showed that doubling isoflavone intake increased plasma concentrations by @-@ % ( s.e. @-@ % , R ( @ ) > @ ) for daidzein , genistein , equol ( only for producers ) and total isoflavones ; for glycitein the association was weaker ( @ % , R ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Adjustments for energy , carbohydrate and fat intake did not affect these estimates .
RESULTS	Inter-individual variation , estimated based on repeated measures in one of the studies , was @-@ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations was adequately quantified , the use of isoflavone intake data for risk assessment needs caution due to large inter-individual variation in plasma concentrations .

BACKGROUND	The simultaneous presence of cancer and other medical conditions ( comorbidity ) is frequent .
BACKGROUND	Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for as well head and neck cancer ( HNC ) and lung cancer ( LC ) as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
BACKGROUND	COPD is the most common comorbidity in LC patients , and presence of COPD worsens the prognosis of HNC and LC .
BACKGROUND	COPD is under-diagnosed and under-treated in the Danish population .
BACKGROUND	The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of COPD in a HNC and LC population , and to determine the need and feasibility of a randomized controlled phase II trial comparing usual care with optimized medical treatment of COPD in cancer patients .
METHODS	All patients with HNC or LC referred for oncologic treatment in a university hospital during a @-month period were invited to attend a pulmonary clinic for evaluation of lung function .
METHODS	Patients who were found to have concomitant COPD were randomized to intervention or usual care .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were prevalence of COPD among the referred patients with either LC or HNC , and further whether the patients that were diagnosed with COPD already received treatment in accordance with Danish COPD guidelines .
METHODS	Secondary outcome was feasibility , i.e. the proportion of eligible patients that accepted follow-up in the pulmonary clinic for @ weeks in addition to oncological treatment .
METHODS	The design of the randomized trail is described in detail .
RESULTS	In total @ patients of whom @ % had LC and @ % HNC have been screened during the first seven months of this ongoing trial .
RESULTS	Sixty-eight percent of LC patients and @ % of HNC patients had COPD .
RESULTS	All but one of @ eligible patients accepted randomization .
RESULTS	Nearly one third ( @ % ) of the LC and HNC patients with COPD were diagnosed prior to study entry , and of these , only @ % were receiving correct treatment according to current guidelines .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with LC , and to a lesser extend HNC , there is a need for improved diagnosis and treatment of concomitant COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , patients found it acceptable to be scheduled for a @-week follow-up in a pulmonary clinic along with their oncological treatment .

BACKGROUND	Existing eye-tracking literature has shown that both adults and children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) show fewer and slower fixations on faces .
BACKGROUND	Despite this reduced saliency and processing of other faces , recognition of their own face is reported to be more `` typical '' in nature .
BACKGROUND	This study uses eye-tracking to explore the typicality of gaze patterns when children with ASD attend their own faces compared to other familiar and unfamiliar faces .
METHODS	Eye-tracking methodology was used to explore fixation duration and time taken to fixate on the Eye and Mouth regions of familiar , unfamiliar and Self Faces .
METHODS	Twenty-one children with ASD ( @-@ years ) were compared to typically developing matched groups .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between children with ASD and typically matched groups for fixation patterns to the Eye and Mouth areas of all face types ( familiar , unfamiliar and self ) .
RESULTS	Correlational analyses showed that attention to the Eye area of unfamiliar and Self Faces was related to socio-communicative ability in children with ASD .
CONCLUSIONS	Levels of socio-communicative ability in children with ASD were related to gaze patterns on unfamiliar and Self Faces , but not familiar faces .
CONCLUSIONS	This lack of relationship between ability and attention to familiar faces may indicate that children across the autism spectrum are able to fixate these faces in a similar way .
CONCLUSIONS	The implications for these findings are discussed .

OBJECTIVE	To determine if increasing the hormone dose or eliminating the hormone-free interval improves key pharmacokinetic ( PK ) alterations caused by obesity during oral contraceptive ( OC ) use .
METHODS	Obese -LSB- body mass index ( BMI ) @ kg/m ( @ ) -RSB- , ovulatory , otherwise healthy , women received an OC containing @ mcg ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) / @ mcg levonorgestrel ( LNG ) dosed cyclically ( @ days active pills with @-day placebo week ) for two cycles and then were randomized for two additional cycles to the following : continuous cycling ( CC , a dose neutral arm using the same OC with no hormone-free interval ) or increased dose ( ID , a dose escalation arm using an OC containing @ mcg EE/@ mcg LNG cyclically ) .
METHODS	During Cycles @ , @ and @ , outpatient visits were performed to assess maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) , area under the curve ( AUC@ - ) and time to steady state as well as pharmacodynamics .
METHODS	These key PK parameters were calculated and compared within groups between baseline and treatment cycles .
RESULTS	A total of @ women enrolled and completed the study ( CC group , n = @ ; ID group , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Demographics were similar between groups -LSB- mean BMI : CC , @ kg/m ( @ ) ( S.D. @ ) ; ID , @ kg/m ( @ ) ( S.D. @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	At baseline , the key LNG PK parameters were no different between groups ; average time to reach steady state was @ days in both groups ; Cmax were CC : @ ng/mL and ID : @ ng/mL ; and AUC@ - were CC : @ h ng/mL and ID : @ h ng/mL .
RESULTS	Following randomization , the CC group maintained steady-state serum levels whereas the ID group had a significantly higher Cmax ( p < @ ) but again required @ days to achieve steady state .
RESULTS	However , AUC was not significantly different between CC ( @ h ng/mL ) and ID ( @ h ng/mL ) .
RESULTS	Forty-five percent ( @/@ ) of the study population had evidence of an active follicle-like structure prior to randomization and afterwards this decreased to @ % ( @/@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both increasing the OC dose and continuous dosing appear to counteract the impact of obesity on key OC PK parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	Obesity adversely affects the pharmacokinetics of very low dose OC pills .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the impact of these changes on OC efficacy is still under debate , PK parameters can be normalized in obese users by continuous dosing or increasing to a low-dose pill .

BACKGROUND	Postural balance and potentially fall risk increases among older adults living with neurological diseases , especially Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
BACKGROUND	Since conventional therapies such as levodopa or deep brain stimulation may fail to alleviate or may even worsen balance , interest is growing in evaluating alternative PD therapies .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the current study was to assess improvement in postural balance in PD patients following electroacupuncture ( EA ) as an alternative therapy .
METHODS	@ aging adults ( @ @ years ) with idiopathic PD and @ healthy age-matched participants ( @ @ years ) were recruited .
METHODS	The PD participants were randomly assigned ( at a ratio of @:@ ) to an intervention ( n = @ ) or to a control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The intervention group received a @-min EA treatment on a weekly basis for @ weeks , while the control group received a sham treatment .
METHODS	Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the final therapy .
METHODS	Measurements included balance assessment , specifically the ratio of medial-lateral ( ML ) center-of-gravity ( COG ) sway to anterior-posterior ( AP ) sway ( COGML/AP ) and ankle/hip sway during eyes-open , eyes-closed , and eyes-open dual-task trials , the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , as well as quality of life , concerns for fall , and pain questionnaires .
RESULTS	No difference was observed for the assessed parameters between the intervention and the control group at baseline .
RESULTS	After treatment , an improvement in balance performance was observed in the intervention group .
RESULTS	Compared with the healthy population , PD patients prior to treatment had larger COGML/AP sway with more dependency on upper-body movements for maintaining balance .
RESULTS	Following EA therapy , COGML/AP sway was reduced by @ % and ankle/hip sway increased by @ % in the different conditions ( p = @ for the dual-task condition ) .
RESULTS	The clinical rating revealed an overall improvement ( p < @ ) in mentation , behavior , and mood ( UPDRS part I , @ % ) , activities of daily living ( UPDRS part II , @ % ) , and motor examination ( UPDRS part III , @ % ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant reduction ( p < @ ) in the specific items regarding UPDRS fall status ( @ % ) and rigidity ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Changes were small and nonsignificant in the controls ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study demonstrates improvement in rigidity and balance following EA .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary results suggest EA could be a promising alternative treatment for balance disturbance in PD .

BACKGROUND	Smoking reduction remains a pivotal issue in public health policy , but quit rates obtained with traditional quit-smoking therapies remain disappointingly low .
BACKGROUND	Tobacco Harm Reduction ( THR ) , aiming at less harmful ways of consuming nicotine , may provide a more effective alternative .
BACKGROUND	One promising candidate for THR are electronic cigarettes ( e-cigs ) .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of second-generation e-cigs both in terms of acute craving-reduction in the lab and in terms of smoking reduction and experienced benefits/complaints in an eight-month Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) .
METHODS	RCT with three arms .
METHODS	Participants ( N = @ ) unwilling to quit smoking were randomized into two e-cig groups and one control group .
METHODS	During three lab sessions ( over two months ) participants , who had been abstinent for four hours , vaped/smoked for five minutes , after which we monitored the effect on craving and withdrawal symptoms .
METHODS	eCO and saliva cotinine levels were also measured .
METHODS	In between lab sessions , participants in the e-cig groups could use e-cigs or smoke ad libitum , whereas the control group could only smoke .
METHODS	After the lab sessions , the control group also received an e-cig .
METHODS	The RCT included several questionnaires , which repeatedly monitored the effect of ad libitum e-cig use on the use of tobacco cigarettes and the experienced benefits/complaints up to six months after the last lab session .
RESULTS	From the first lab session on , e-cig use after four hours of abstinence resulted in a reduction in cigarette craving which was of the same magnitude as when a cigarette was smoked , while eCO was unaffected .
RESULTS	After two months , we observed that @ % of the e-cig groups had stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes , versus @ % of the control group .
RESULTS	After five months , the e-cig groups demonstrated a total quit-rate of @ % , whereas the control group showed a quit rate of @ % three months after initiating e-cig use .
RESULTS	At the end of the eight-month study , @ % of the e-cig groups and @ % of the control group were totally abstinent from smoking , while an overall reduction of @ % in the number of cigarettes smoked per day was observed ( compared to intake ) .
RESULTS	eCO levels decreased , whereas cotinine levels were the same in all groups at each moment of measurement .
RESULTS	Reported benefits far outweighed the reported complaints .
CONCLUSIONS	In a series of controlled lab sessions with e-cig nave tobacco smokers , second generation e-cigs were shown to be immediately and highly effective in reducing abstinence induced cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms , while not resulting in increases in eCO .
CONCLUSIONS	Remarkable ( > @ pc ) eight-month reductions in , or complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was achieved with the e-cig in almost half ( @ % ) of the participants .

BACKGROUND	A topical fixed-dose clindamycin phosphate @ % and benzoyl peroxide @ % combination gel ( CLNP/BPO @ % ) is known to be effective and safe in white people with acne .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLNP/BPO @ % topically applied once or twice daily vs. CLNP twice daily in Japanese patients with acne .
METHODS	Eight hundred patients were randomized to receive CLNP/BPO @ % once daily , CLNP/BPO @ % twice daily or CLNP twice daily for @weeks .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were absolute change in number of total lesions ( TLs ) from baseline to week @ to demonstrate the superiority of CLNP/BPO @ % twice daily and noninferiority of CLNP/BPO @ % once daily vs. CLNP twice daily .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were absolute and percentage changes in TLs , inflammatory lesions ( ILs ) , noninflammatory lesions ( non-ILs ) and Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) score .
METHODS	Safety assessments included adverse events ( AEs ) , laboratory tests , vital signs and local skin tolerability .
RESULTS	Change in TL counts from baseline to week @ for CLNP/BPO @ % twice daily was superior to CLNP twice daily ( difference -@ ; P < @ ) ; CLNP/BPO @ % once daily was not inferior to CLNP twice daily ( difference -@ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Absolute and percentage reductions in TL , IL and non-IL counts and ISGA score were greater for CLNP/BPO @ % once or twice daily than for CLNP twice daily with significant differences seen from early on .
RESULTS	Most AEs were mild or moderate .
RESULTS	The incidence of adverse drug reactions was higher for CLNP/BPO @ % once ( @ % ) or twice ( @ % ) daily than for CLNP twice daily ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with CLNP twice daily , CLNP/BPO @ % once daily was more effective and CLNP/BPO @ % twice daily at least as effective , with an early onset of action and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in Japanese patients .

METHODS	Multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study from March @ to April @ in @ cardiovascular intensive care units in Italy .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @ patients admitted to intensive care units after cardiac surgery with early acute kidney injury ( @ % increase of serum creatinine level from baseline or oliguria for @ hours ) to receive fenoldopam ( @ patients ) or placebo ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	We used a computer-generated permuted block randomization sequence for treatment allocation .
METHODS	All patients completed their follow-up @ days after surgery , and data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle .
METHODS	Continuous infusion of fenoldopam or placebo for up to @ days with a starting dose of @ g/kg/min ( range , @-@ @ g/kg/min ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was the rate of renal replacement therapy .
METHODS	Secondary end points included mortality ( intensive care unit and @-day mortality ) and the rate of hypotension during study drug infusion .
RESULTS	The study was stopped for futility as recommended by the safety committee after a planned interim analysis .
RESULTS	Sixty-nine of @ patients ( @ % ) allocated to the fenoldopam group and @ of @ patients ( @ % ) allocated to the placebo group received renal replacement therapy ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mortality at @ days was @ of @ ( @ % ) in the fenoldopam group and @ of @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hypotension occurred in @ ( @ % ) patients in the fenoldopam group and in @ ( @ % ) patients in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery , fenoldopam infusion , compared with placebo , did not reduce the need for renal replacement therapy or risk of @-day mortality but was associated with an increased rate of hypotension .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) - directed therapy for infants and young children with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , rather than standard therapy , was justified on the grounds of a decrease in average costs and whether the use of BAL reduced treatment costs associated with hospital admissions .
METHODS	Costs were assessed in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia and New Zealand on infants diagnosed with CF after newborn screening and assigned to receive either BAL-directed or standard therapy until they reached @ years of age .
METHODS	A health care funder perspective was adopted .
METHODS	Resource use measurement was based on standardized data collection forms administered for patients across all sites .
METHODS	Unit costs were obtained primarily from government schedules .
RESULTS	Mean costs per child during the study period were Australian dollars ( AUD ) @ in BAL-directed therapy group and AUD@ in standard therapy group ( mean difference AUD@ , @ % CI AUD-@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean hospital costs per child during the study period were AUD@ in the BAL-directed therapy group and AUD@ in the standard therapy group ( mean difference AUD-@ ; @ % CI AUD-@ to @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BAL-directed therapy did not result in either lower mean hospital admission costs or mean costs overall compared with managing patients with CF by a standard protocol based upon clinical features and oropharyngeal culture results alone .
CONCLUSIONS	Following on our previous findings that BAL-directed treatment offers no clinical advantage over standard therapy at age @ years , flexible bronchoscopy with BAL can not be recommended for the routine management of preschool children with CF on the basis of overall cost savings .

BACKGROUND	Recent research has investigated the use of ultrasound ( US ) for confirming endotracheal tube ( ETT ) placement with varying techniques , accuracies , and challenges .
BACKGROUND	Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of a novel , simplified , four-step ( @S ) technique .
METHODS	We conducted a blinded , randomized trial of the @S technique utilizing an adult human cadaver model .
METHODS	ETT placement was randomized to tracheal or esophageal location .
METHODS	Three US experts and @ emergency medicine residents ( EMR ) performed a total of @ scans .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the overall sensitivity and specificity of both experts and EMRs to detect location of ETT placement .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included a priori subgroup comparison of experts and EMRs for thin and obese cadavers , time to detection , and level of operator confidence .
RESULTS	Experts had a sensitivity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) and specificity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) on thin , and a sensitivity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) and specificity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) on obese cadavers .
RESULTS	EMRs had a sensitivity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) and of specificity @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) on thin , and a sensitivity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) specificity of @ % ( @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) on obese cadavers .
RESULTS	The overall mean time to detection was @ seconds ( @ % CI = @ seconds to @ seconds , range : @ to @ seconds ) for US experts and @ seconds ( @ % CI = @ seconds to @ seconds ; range : @ to @ seconds ) for EMRs .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant decrease in the specificity of this technique on obese cadavers when comparing the EMRs and experts , as well as an increased overall time to detection among the EMRs .
CONCLUSIONS	The simplified @S technique was accurate and rapid for US experts .
CONCLUSIONS	Among novices , the @S technique was accurate in thin , but appears less accurate in obese cadavers .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies will determine optimal teaching time and accuracy in emergency department patients .

OBJECTIVE	Uncertainty remains about the efficacy of folic acid therapy for the primary prevention of stroke because of limited and inconsistent data .
OBJECTIVE	To test the primary hypothesis that therapy with enalapril and folic acid is more effective in reducing first stroke than enalapril alone among Chinese adults with hypertension .
METHODS	The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial , a randomized , double-blind clinical trial conducted from May @ , @ , to August @ , @ , in @ communities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces in China .
METHODS	A total of @,@ adults with hypertension without history of stroke or myocardial infarction ( MI ) participated in the study .
METHODS	Eligible participants , stratified by MTHFR C@T genotypes ( CC , CT , and TT ) , were randomly assigned to receive double-blind daily treatment with a single-pill combination containing enalapril , @ mg , and folic acid , @ mg ( n = @,@ ) or a tablet containing enalapril , @ mg , alone ( n = @,@ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was first stroke .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included first ischemic stroke ; first hemorrhagic stroke ; MI ; a composite of cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death , MI , and stroke ; and all-cause death .
RESULTS	During a median treatment duration of @ years , compared with the enalapril alone group , the enalapril-folic acid group had a significant risk reduction in first stroke ( @ % of participants in the enalapril-folic acid group vs @ % in the enalapril alone group ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , first ischemic stroke ( @ % with enalapril-folic acid vs @ % with enalapril alone ; HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and composite cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death , MI , and stroke ( @ % with enalapril-folic acid vs @ % with enalapril alone ; HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The risks of hemorrhagic stroke ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , MI ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and all-cause deaths ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) did not differ significantly between the @ treatment groups .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the @ treatment groups in the frequencies of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Among adults with hypertension in China without a history of stroke or MI , the combined use of enalapril and folic acid , compared with enalapril alone , significantly reduced the risk of first stroke .

BACKGROUND	To optimize positive outcomes , the design of new pharmacy services should consider the preferences of consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and their carers .
OBJECTIVE	( i ) To evaluate the relative importance of community pharmacy service characteristics , from the perspective of consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and carers ; ( ii ) To compare consumer and carer preferences to health professional beliefs about ideal service characteristics for consumers .
METHODS	A discrete choice experiment was completed by consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and/or carers ( n = @ ) and health professionals ( n = @ ) , recruited from four regions in Australia .
METHODS	Participants were each randomized to one survey version containing four ( from a total @ ) different choices between two new pharmacy services .
METHODS	Consumer and carer participants were also given an ` opt out ' alternative of current service .
METHODS	Each service was described using six attributes related to pharmacy service characteristics : continued medicines supply , continuity and coordinated care , location , medication management , education and information , and cost .
RESULTS	Consumers and carers placed highest priority on continued medicines supply by a pharmacist for regular and symptom flare up medicines ( @ priority points ) , a pharmacy located within a ` one-stop ' health center ( @ points ) and home delivery of medicines ( @ points ) .
RESULTS	Although continuedmedicines supply was most important for consumers and carers , pharmacy location was perceivedby health professionals to be the most important characteristic for consumers .
RESULTS	Participants were less inclined to choose new services if their current pharmacy offered high quality services thatwere person-centered , easy to access and responsive to their needs .
RESULTS	Younger , more highly educated and employed participants , and those with established condition ( s ) were more likely to choose new services .
CONCLUSIONS	Person-centered care is a fundamental tenet for pharmacy services .
CONCLUSIONS	The provision of continued medicines supply ( e.g. through pharmacist prescribing ) , convenient and coordinated care delivered through a one stop health centre , and home delivery of medicines , should be prioritized when planning pharmacy services to best assist consumers to manage chronic conditions .

OBJECTIVE	Farm youth continue to experience high rates of injury and deaths as a result of agricultural activities .
OBJECTIVE	Farm machinery , especially tractors , is the most common cause of casualties to youth .
OBJECTIVE	A Roll-Over Protection Structure ( ROPS ) along with a fastened seatbelt can prevent almost all injuries and fatalities from tractor overturns .
OBJECTIVE	Despite this knowledge , the use of seatbelts by farmers on ROPS tractors remains low .
OBJECTIVE	This study treats farm safety as a family issue and builds on the central role of parents as teachers and role models of farm safety for youth .
METHODS	This research study used a longitudinal , repeated-measures , randomized-control design in which youth @-@years of age were randomly assigned to either of two intervention groups ( parent-led group and staff-led group ) or the control group .
RESULTS	Fathers in the parent-led group were less likely to operate ROPS tractors without a seatbelt compared with other groups .
RESULTS	They were more likely to have communicated with youth about the importance of wearing seatbelts on ROPS tractors .
RESULTS	Consequently , youth in the parent-led group were less likely to operate a ROPS tractor without a seatbelt than the control group at post-test .
CONCLUSIONS	This randomized control trial supports the effectiveness of a home-based , father-led farm safety intervention as a promising strategy for reducing youth as well as father-unsafe behaviors ( related to tractor seatbelts ) on the farm .
CONCLUSIONS	This intervention appealed to fathers ' strong motivation to practice tractor safety for the sake of their youth .
CONCLUSIONS	Involving fathers helped change both father as well as youth unsafe tractor-seatbelt behaviors .

BACKGROUND	Several studies have confirmed dramatic changes in skin surface parameters during the winter months .
BACKGROUND	Although there are many studies supporting the positive effects of topical treatment , there are no published studies demonstrating the effects of oral supplementation in the prevention of negative skin changes during winter .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an oral micronutrient supplement in preventing the negative effects of winter weather on skin quality using noninvasive biometrologic instruments .
METHODS	This study included @ healthy female volunteers aged @-@ years with phototype II-IV skin .
METHODS	Randomization was balanced .
METHODS	Two tablets of a micronutrient supplement ( Perfectil Platinum ) or placebo were administered once daily for @ months .
METHODS	The volunteers were examined at baseline , after @ months , and @ weeks after termination of treatment ( month @ ) .
METHODS	The evaluation included skin microrelief by Visioscan as the main outcome , and the secondary outcomes were results on standard macrophotography , skin tension by Reviscometer , skin high-frequency ultrasound , and self-assessment .
RESULTS	For all pseudoroughness and microrelief indicators , there was a significant increase from baseline to month @ in the placebo group ( P < @ ) but no change in the active group .
RESULTS	Descriptive statistics for the mean minimum , mean maximum , and minimum to maximum ratio on the nonexposed study zone showed a significant and dramatic difference between baseline and month @ and between baseline and month @ ( P < @ ) in the active group , indicating decreasing anisotropy of the skin .
RESULTS	High-frequency ultrasound on the exposed study zone revealed that skin thickness was significantly decreased in the placebo group during winter but was stable in the treated group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The photography scaling and self-assessment questionnaire revealed no significant changes in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that the skin is prone to seasonal changes during winter , particularly in exposed areas .
CONCLUSIONS	The data also indicate that oral supplementation can be a safe treatment , with no serious side effects , and may prevent or even eliminate the negative effects of winter on the skin .

METHODS	Multicentre , open label , three arm , parallel group , randomised controlled non-inferiority trial .
METHODS	@ centres in the Netherlands .
METHODS	Couples seeking fertility treatment after at least @ months of unprotected intercourse , with the female partner aged between @ and @ years , an unfavourable prognosis for natural conception , and a diagnosis of unexplained or mild male subfertility .
METHODS	Three cycles of in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer ( plus subsequent cryocycles ) , six cycles of in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , or six cycles of intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation within @ months after randomisation .
METHODS	The primary outcome was birth of a healthy child resulting from a singleton pregnancy conceived within @ months after randomisation .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were live birth , clinical pregnancy , ongoing pregnancy , multiple pregnancy , time to pregnancy , complications of pregnancy , and neonatal morbidity and mortality
RESULTS	@ couples were randomly assigned between January @ and February @ ; @ were allocated to in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer , @ to in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , and @ to intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation .
RESULTS	Birth of a healthy child occurred in @ ( @ % ) couples in the in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer group , @ ( @ % ) in the in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle group , and @ ( @ % ) in the intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation group .
RESULTS	This corresponds to a risk , relative to intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation , of @ ( @ % confidence interval @ to @ ) for in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer and @ ( @ to @ ) for in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle .
RESULTS	These @ % confidence intervals do not extend below the predefined threshold of @ for inferiority .
RESULTS	Multiple pregnancy rates per ongoing pregnancy were @ % ( @/@ ) after in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer , @ % ( @/@ ) after in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , and @ % ( @/@ ) after intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation ( one sided P = @ for in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer compared with intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation ; one sided P = @ for in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle compared with intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ) .

BACKGROUND	Acute hamstring re-injuries are common and hard to predict .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the association between clinical and imaging findings and the occurrence of hamstring re-injuries .
METHODS	We obtained baseline data ( clinical and MRI findings ) of athletes who sustained an acute hamstring injury within @days of initial injury .
METHODS	We also collected data of standardised clinical tests within @days after return to play ( RTP ) .
METHODS	The number of re-injuries was recorded within @months .
METHODS	We analysed the association between the possible predictive variables and re-injuries with a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model .
RESULTS	Eighty patients were included at baseline and @ patients could be included in the final analysis because data after RTP were not available in @ cases .
RESULTS	There were @ re-injuries ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	None of the baseline MRI findings were univariately associated with re-injury .
RESULTS	A higher number of previous hamstring injuries ( adjusted OR ( AOR ) @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) , more degrees of active knee extension deficit after RTP ( AOR @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) , isometric knee flexion force deficit at @ after RTP ( AOR @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) and presence of localised discomfort on hamstring palpation after RTP ( AOR @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) were significant independent predictors of re-injury .
RESULTS	Athletes with localised discomfort on hamstring palpation just after RTP were consequently almost four times more likely to sustain a re-injury .
CONCLUSIONS	The number of previous hamstring injuries , active knee extension deficit , isometric knee flexion force deficit at @ and presence of localised discomfort on palpation just after RTP are associated with a higher hamstring re-injury rate .
CONCLUSIONS	None of the baseline MRI parameters was a predictor of hamstring re-injury .

OBJECTIVE	Intra-arterial treatment ( IAT ) in patients with acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) can be performed with or without general anesthesia ( GA ) .
OBJECTIVE	Previous studies suggested that IAT without the use of GA ( non-GA ) is associated with better clinical outcome .
OBJECTIVE	Nevertheless , no consensus exists about the anesthetic management during IAT of AIS patients .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigates the association between type of anesthesia and clinical outcome in a large cohort of patients with AIS treated with IAT .
METHODS	All consecutive patients with AIS of the anterior circulation who received IAT between @ and @ in @ Dutch hospitals were included in the study .
METHODS	Primary outcome was functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale at discharge .
METHODS	Difference in primary outcome between GA and non-GA was estimated using multiple ordinal regression analysis , adjusting for age , stroke severity , occlusion of the internal carotid artery terminus , previous stroke , atrial fibrillation , and diabetes mellitus .
RESULTS	Three hundred forty-eight patients were included in the analysis ; @ patients received GA and @ patients did not receive GA. .
RESULTS	Non-GA was significantly associated with good clinical outcome ( odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjusting for prespecified prognostic factors , the point estimate remained similar ; statistical significance , however , was lost ( odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study suggests that patients with AIS of the anterior circulation undergoing IAT without GA have a higher probability of good clinical outcome compared with patients treated with general anesthesia .

OBJECTIVE	Restenosis is a limitation of endovascular interventions performed in the superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) .
OBJECTIVE	Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the perivascular delivery of tissue-engineered allogeneic aortic endothelial cells ( PVS-@ ) reduced stenosis in porcine models of SFA revascularization .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous PVS-@ delivery after angioplasty and stenting in the SFA of patients with peripheral artery disease .
METHODS	In this phase I open-label trial , @ patients ( average lesion length of @ @ cm and @ % stenosis ) were treated with PVS-@ : @ in a low-dose cohort ( cohort A ) and @ in a high-dose cohort ( cohort B ) .
METHODS	The primary objective was to demonstrate the safety ( incidence of major adverse events ) of PVS-@ within @ weeks after surgery .
METHODS	Secondary end points included assessments of resting ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) in the treated leg , Fontaine class , and time to target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) .
RESULTS	No patient had a major adverse event within @ weeks .
RESULTS	One patient required a limb amputation at @ weeks .
RESULTS	At @ weeks , cohort A and cohort B patients maintained a @ % and @ % increase in ABI compared with baseline , respectively ; @ % of cohort A and @ % of cohort B improved by @ Fontaine classification stage , and the TLR rate was @ % for cohort A and @ % for cohort B.
CONCLUSIONS	Percutaneous local delivery of PVS-@ is a well-tolerated and novel therapeutic approach that may be a suitable treatment for patients after endovascular intervention of the SFA .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger randomized trials are needed to determine if PVS-@ can improve ABI and reduce TLR rates .

OBJECTIVE	Administration of secretin improves noninvasive imaging of the pancreatic duct with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) .
OBJECTIVE	We performed a large prospective study to investigate whether synthetic human secretin ( RG@ ) - stimulated MRCP detects pancreatic duct abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity than MRCP .
METHODS	We performed a phase @ , multicenter , baseline-controlled study of patients with acute or acute recurrent pancreatitis who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) between March @ , @ , and October @ , @ .
METHODS	Patients underwent a baseline MRCP that was immediately followed by administration of RG@ and repeat MRCP and then underwent ERCP within @ days ; they were followed up for @ days .
METHODS	MRCP and ERCP images were read centrally by @ radiologists and @ endoscopists , respectively , who were all independent and blinded ; pancreatic duct abnormalities were evaluated .
METHODS	The accuracy of MRCP was evaluated using ERCP as the standard .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients were enrolled in the study ; @ MRCP image sets were assessed , and @ patients had evaluable ERCPs .
RESULTS	Pancreatic duct abnormalities were observed in @ % of ERCP images .
RESULTS	All radiologists identified duct abnormalities in RG@-cin MRCP image sets with significantly higher levels of sensitivity ( P < @ ) than in images from MRCP , with minimal loss of specificity .
RESULTS	Adverse events were reported in @ % of patients after MRCP and @ % after ERCP .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who experienced a serious adverse event , @ ( @ % ) and @ ( @ % ) of the events were reported to be temporally associated with MRCP and ERCP , respectively .
RESULTS	The adverse events most frequently considered related to RG@ were nausea , abdominal pain , and flushing ; most were mild .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with images from MRCP , those from RG@-stimulated MRCP are improved in many aspects and could aid in diagnosis and clinical decision making for patients with acute , acute recurrent , or chronic pancreatitis .
CONCLUSIONS	RG@-enhanced MRCP might also better identify patients in need of therapeutic ERCP ( ClinicalTrials.gov , Number : NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Stress , depression , and anxiety affect @ % to @ % of pregnant women .
BACKGROUND	However , substantial barriers to psychosocial assessment exist , resulting in less than @ % of prenatal care providers assessing and treating mental health problems .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , pregnant women are often reluctant to disclose their mental health concerns to a healthcare provider .
BACKGROUND	Identifying screening and assessment tools and procedures that are acceptable to both women and service providers , cost-effective , and clinically useful is needed .
METHODS	The primary objective of this randomized , parallel-group , superiority trial is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer tablet-based prenatal psychosocial assessment ( e-screening ) compared to paper-based screening .
METHODS	Secondary objectives are to compare the two modes of screening on : ( @ ) the level of detection of prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms and psychosocial risk ; ( @ ) the level of disclosure of symptoms ; ( @ ) the factors associated with feasibility , acceptability , and disclosure ; ( @ ) the psychometric properties of the e-version of the assessment tools ; and ( @ ) cost-effectiveness .
METHODS	A sample of @ women will be recruited from large , primary care maternity clinics and a high-risk antenatal unit in an urban Canadian city .
METHODS	Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they : ( @ ) receive care at one of the recruitment sites ; ( @ ) are able to speak/read English ; ( @ ) are willing to be randomized to e-screening ; and ( @ ) are willing to participate in a follow-up diagnostic interview within @ week of recruitment .
METHODS	Allocation is by computer-generated randomization .
METHODS	Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment on a computer tablet , while those in the control group will complete the same assessment in paper-based form .
METHODS	All women will complete baseline questionnaires at the time of recruitment and will participate in a diagnostic interview within @ week of recruitment .
METHODS	Research assistants conducting diagnostic interviews and physicians will be blinded .
METHODS	A qualitative descriptive study involving healthcare providers from the recruitment sites and women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention .
METHODS	We hypothesize that mental health e-screening in primary care maternity settings and high-risk antenatal units will be as or more feasible , acceptable , and capable of detecting depression , anxiety , and psychosocial risk compared to paper-based screening .

BACKGROUND	Breastfeeding is associated with significant positive health outcomes for mothers and infants .
BACKGROUND	However , despite recommendations from the World Health Organization , exclusive breastfeeding for six months is uncommon .
BACKGROUND	Increased breastfeeding support early in the postpartum period may be effective in improving breastfeeding maintenance .
BACKGROUND	This trial will evaluate two community-based interventions to increase breastfeeding duration in Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) in Victoria , Australia .
METHODS	A three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used .
METHODS	Victorian LGAs with a lower than average rate of any breastfeeding at discharge from hospital and more than @ births per year that agree to participate will be randomly allocated to one of three trial arms : @ ) standard care ; @ ) home-based breastfeeding support ; or @ ) home-based breastfeeding support plus access to a community-based breastfeeding drop-in centre .
METHODS	The services provided in LGAs allocated to ` standard care ' are those routinely available to postpartum women .
METHODS	LGAs allocated to the home-based visiting intervention will provide home-visits to women who are identified as at risk of breastfeeding cessation in the early postnatal period .
METHODS	These visits will be provided by Maternal and Child Health Nurses who have received training to provide the intervention ( SILC-MCHNs ) .
METHODS	In areas allocated to receive the second intervention , in addition to home-based breastfeeding support , community breastfeeding drop-in centres will be made available , staffed by a SILC-MCHN .
METHODS	The interventions will run in LGAs for a nine to twelve month period depending on birth numbers .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at four months of age .
METHODS	Breastfeeding outcomes will be obtained from routinely collected Maternal and Child Health centre data and from a new data item collecting infant feeding ` in the last @ hours ' .
METHODS	Information will also be obtained directly from women via a postal survey .
METHODS	A comprehensive process evaluation will be conducted .
CONCLUSIONS	This study will determine if early home-based breastfeeding support by a health professional for women at risk of stopping breastfeeding , with or without access to a community-based breastfeeding drop-in centre , increases breastfeeding duration in Victorian LGAs with low breastfeeding rates .

BACKGROUND	Insulin-resistant states , including type @ diabetes ( T@D ) and prediabetes , are associated with elevated cardiovascular ( CV ) risk .
BACKGROUND	Aleglitazar is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / agonist with favorable insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering actions , favorable effects on blood lipids , and an acceptable safety profile in short-time studies .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , it was hypothesized that aleglitazar would reduce CV morbidity and mortality in patients with T@D mellitus and prediabetes ( defined as glycosylated hemoglobin @ % to < @ % ) with previous CV complications .
METHODS	ALEPREVENT was a phase III , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , trial comparing aleglitazar @ g or placebo daily in patients with T@D or prediabetes with established , stable CV disease .
METHODS	The intended sample size was @,@ with a primary efficacy measure of major adverse CV events .
METHODS	However , the trial was halted prematurely after @,@ patients had been randomized because of futility and an unfavorable benefit risk ratio in another CV outcomes trial evaluating aleglitazar .
RESULTS	At study termination after @ @ days of treatment , data had been collected from @,@ patients ( @,@ with T@D and @ with pre-T@D ) .
RESULTS	Despite the brief duration of treatment , aleglitazar induced favorable changes in glycosylated hemoglobin and blood lipids , similar for participants with T@D or prediabetes .
RESULTS	However , compared with placebo , aleglitazar increased the incidence of hypoglycemia ( @ vs @ ; P < @ ) , and muscular events ( @ vs@ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Even within a short duration of exposure , aleglitazar was associated with excess adverse events , corroborating the findings of a larger and longer trial in T@D .
CONCLUSIONS	Coupled with the previous failure of several other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / activators , this class now holds little promise for CV therapeutics .

BACKGROUND	Delirium is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Haloperidol is the most commonly used drug for delirium despite little evidence of its effectiveness .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to establish whether early treatment with haloperidol would decrease the time that survivors of critical illness spent in delirium or coma .
METHODS	We did this double-blind , placebo-controlled randomised trial in a general adult intensive care unit ( ICU ) .
METHODS	Critically ill patients ( @ years ) needing mechanical ventilation within @ h of admission were enrolled .
METHODS	Patients were randomised ( by an independent nurse , in @:@ ratio , with permuted block size of four and six , using a centralised , secure web-based randomisation service ) to receive haloperidol @ mg or @ % saline placebo intravenously every @ h , irrespective of coma or delirium status .
METHODS	Study drug was discontinued on ICU discharge , once delirium-free and coma-free for @ consecutive days , or after a maximum of @ days of treatment , whichever came first .
METHODS	Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the ICU ( CAM-ICU ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was delirium-free and coma-free days , defined as the number of days in the first @ days after randomisation during which the patient was alive without delirium and not in coma from any cause .
METHODS	Patients who died within the @ day study period were recorded as having @ days free of delirium and coma .
METHODS	ICU clinical and research staff and patients were masked to treatment throughout the study .
METHODS	Analyses were by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	@ patients were randomised , @ were included in the final analysis ( @ haloperidol , @ placebo ) .
RESULTS	Patients in the haloperidol group spent about the same number of days alive , without delirium , and without coma as did patients in the placebo group ( median @ days -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- vs @ days -LSB- @-@ -RSB- days ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events were oversedation ( @ patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group ) and QTc prolongation ( seven patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group ) .
RESULTS	No patient had a serious adverse event related to the study drug .
CONCLUSIONS	These results do not support the hypothesis that haloperidol modifies duration of delirium in critically ill patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Although haloperidol can be used safely in this population of patients , pending the results of trials in progress , the use of intravenous haloperidol should be reserved for short-term management of acute agitation .

OBJECTIVE	A recently published study showed the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases .
OBJECTIVE	Participants of this study were included in a prospective follow-up .
METHODS	@ months after finishing LSD psychotherapy , @ participants were tested for anxiety ( STAI ) and participated in a semi-structured interview .
METHODS	A Qualitative Content Analysis ( QCA ) was carried out on the interviews to elaborate about LSD effects and lasting psychological changes .
RESULTS	None of the participants reported lasting adverse reactions .
RESULTS	The significant benefits as measured with the STAI were sustained over a @-month period .
RESULTS	In the QCA participants consistently reported insightful , cathartic and interpersonal experiences , accompanied by a reduction in anxiety ( @ % ) and a rise in quality of life ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Evaluations of subjective experiences suggest facilitated access to emotions , confrontation of previously unknown anxieties , worries , resources and intense emotional peak experiences la Maslow as major psychological working mechanisms .
RESULTS	The experiences created led to a restructuring of the person 's emotional trust , situational understanding , habits and world view .
CONCLUSIONS	LSD administered in a medically supervised psychotherapeutic setting can be safe and generate lasting benefits in patients with a life-threatening disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Explanatory models for the therapeutic effects of LSD warrant further study .

BACKGROUND	To investigate if the cramp threshold frequency ( CTF ) can be altered by electrical muscle stimulation in a shortened position .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy male sport students were randomly allocated to an intervention ( IG , n = @ ) and a non-treatment control group ( CG , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Calf muscles of both legs in the IG were stimulated equally twice a week over @ weeks .
METHODS	The protocol was @ s on , @ s off , @ s impulse width , @ Hz above the individual CTF , and was at @ % of the maximal tolerated stimulation energy .
METHODS	One leg was stimulated in a shortened position , inducing muscle cramps ( CT ) , while the opposite leg was fixated in a neutral position at the ankle , hindering muscle cramps ( nCT ) .
METHODS	CTF tests were performed prior to the first and @ h after the @ ( th ) ( @ w ) and @ ( th ) ( @ w ) training session .
RESULTS	After @ w , the CTF had significantly ( p < @ ) increased in CT calves from @ Hz to @ Hz , while it remained unchanged in nCT ( pre : @ Hz , mid : @ Hz ) and in both legs of the CG ( pre : @ Hz , mid : @ Hz ) .
RESULTS	Only CT saw further insignificant increases in the CTF .
RESULTS	The applied stimulation energy ( mA s ) positively correlated with the effect on the CTF ( r = @ ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study may be useful for developing new non-pharmacological strategies to reduce cramp susceptibility .

OBJECTIVE	Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is a key component of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance .
OBJECTIVE	Mounting evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory characteristics for vitamin D. Although analogues of vitamin D@ have extensively been used in the treatment of various chronic inflammatory diseases , to our knowledge , no such research is conducted in regards with obesity .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this double blind clinical trial study is to investigate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects can affect the cytokine profile and insulin resistance .
OBJECTIVE	Moreover , we evaluated the pathways of vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , PPAR and PGC@ gene expressions which may lead to insulin resistance following treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo .
METHODS	A total of @ obese participants ( BMI@ ) were recruited for the current double blind clinical trial study .
METHODS	Patients were divided into two intervention ( N. = @ ) and control groups ( N. = @ ) based on the stratified randomized method .
METHODS	One-Alpha Capsules @ microgram : alfacalcidol ( @ - hydroxyvitamin D@ ) and placebo were given to subjects once a day for @ weeks .
METHODS	Analysis of body composition was performed with use of Body Composition Analyzer .
METHODS	The circulating levels of TNF - , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , PTH , and @-Hydroxy Vi-tamin D were measured with the use of EIA method .
METHODS	The PBMCs were separated from whole blood by Ficoll-hypaque technique .
METHODS	Total cellular RNA was extracted and the cDNA was synthesized .
METHODS	The real-time PCR using specific primer pairs for VDR , PGC@ , PPAR , and - actin was performed .
RESULTS	The FPG , fat percent and PTH levels were decreased and the levels of HDL-cholesterol and @-hydroxy vitamin D were significantly increased after treatment with Alfacalcidol .
RESULTS	Regarding to cytokines levels , the levels of IL@ were significantly decreased and IL@ were significantly increased in Alfacalcidol group in comparison with the control group .
RESULTS	The relative expressions of VDR , PGC@ , and PPAR genes significantly increased in Alfacalcidol group .
RESULTS	We found also significant positive correlation between circulating @-OH vitamin D and relative PGC@ gene expression in participants with insulin resistance .
CONCLUSIONS	It seems that Alfacalcidol treatment may be effective in amelioration of the inflammatory state in obesity .
CONCLUSIONS	This supplement might also improve resistance to insulin through enhancement of relative VDR and its downstream genes expression , which are demonstrated to be involved in glucose homeostasis pathways .

BACKGROUND	High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity , which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy .
BACKGROUND	The impact of protein from meats for breastfed infants during complementary feeding may be different .
OBJECTIVE	We examined the effect of protein from meat as complementary foods on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants .
METHODS	This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants ( @-@ mo old from the Denver , CO , metro area ) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats ( Meat group ; n = @ ) or infant cereal ( Cereal group ; n = @ ) as their primary complementary feedings for @ mo. .
METHODS	Anthropometric measures and diet records were collected monthly from @ to @ mo of age ; intakes from complementary feeding and breast milk were assessed at @ mo of age .
RESULTS	The Meat group had significantly higher protein intake , whereas energy , carbohydrate , and fat intakes from complementary feeding did not differ by group over time .
RESULTS	At @ mo of age , mean ( SEM ) intakes of total ( complementary feeding plus breast milk ) protein were @ @ and @ @ g kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) , @ % and @ % of daily energy intake , for Meat and Cereal groups , respectively ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	From @ to @ mo of age , the weight-for-age z score ( WAZ ) and length-for-age z score ( LAZ ) increased in the Meat group ( WAZ : @ @ ; LAZ : @ @ ) and decreased in the Cereal group ( WAZ : -@ @ ; LAZ : -@ @ ) ( P-group by time < @ ) .
RESULTS	The change in weight-for-length z score did not differ between groups .
RESULTS	Total protein intake at @ mo of age and baseline WAZ were important predictors of changes in the WAZ ( R ( @ ) = @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In breastfed infants , higher protein intake from meats was associated with greater linear growth and weight gain but without excessive gain in adiposity , suggesting that potential risks of high protein intake may differ between breastfed and formula-fed infants and by the source of protein .

OBJECTIVE	We aimed to examine the association between total number of resected nodes and survival in patients after esophagectomy with and without nCRT .
BACKGROUND	Most studies concerning the potentially positive effect of extended lymphadenectomy on survival have been performed in patients who underwent surgery alone .
BACKGROUND	As nCRT is known to frequently `` sterilize '' regional nodes , it is unclear whether extended lymphadenectomy after nCRT is still useful .
METHODS	Patients from the randomized CROSS-trial who completed the entire protocol ( ie , surgery alone or chemoradiotherapy + surgery ) were included .
METHODS	With Cox regression models , we compared the impact of number of resected nodes as well as resected positive nodes on survival in both groups .
RESULTS	One hundred sixty-one patients underwent surgery alone , and @ patients received multimodality treatment .
RESULTS	The median ( interquartile range ) number of resected nodes was @ ( @-@ ) and @ ( @-@ ) , with @ ( @-@ ) and @ ( @-@ ) resected positive nodes , respectively .
RESULTS	Persistent lymph node positivity after nCRT had a greater negative prognostic impact on survival as compared with lymph node positivity after surgery alone .
RESULTS	The total number of resected nodes was significantly associated with survival for patients in the surgery-alone arm ( hazard ratio per @ additionally resected nodes , @ ; P = @ ) , but not in the multimodality arm ( hazard ratio @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The number of resected nodes had a prognostic impact on survival in patients after surgery alone , but its therapeutic value is still controversial .
CONCLUSIONS	After nCRT , the number of resected nodes was not associated with survival .
CONCLUSIONS	These data question the indication for maximization of lymphadenectomy after nCRT .

METHODS	In this randomized controlled trial , @ patients who met the inclusion criteria were conveniently sampled and randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups after they were matched on age and gender .
METHODS	On the days following surgery , the experimental group received foot reflexology massage on their left foot @mina day for @ days , while the control group was given a gentle foot rub with oil for one minute .
METHODS	Anxiety was measured using the short-form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety .
RESULTS	Both measurement instruments confirmed a significant decrease in anxiety following the foot reflexology massage .
CONCLUSIONS	The significant decrease in anxiety in the experimental group following the foot reflexology massage supports the use of this complementary therapy technique for the relief of anxiety .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate the effect of sequence on response precision and response behavior in health valuation studies .
METHODS	Time trade-off ( TTO ) and paired comparison responses from six health valuation studies-four US , one Spanish , and one Dutch-were examined ( @,@ respondents ) to test whether task sequence influences response precision ( e.g. , rounding ) , response changes , and median response times .
METHODS	Each study used a computer-based instrument that randomized task sequence among a national sample of adults , age @ years or older , from the general population .
RESULTS	For both TTO and paired comparisons , median response times decreased with sequence ( i.e. , learning ) , but tended to flatten after the first three tasks .
RESULTS	Although the paired comparison evidence demonstrated that sequence had no effect on response precision , the frequency of rounded TTO responses ( to either @-year or @-year units ) increased with sequence .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on these results , randomizing or reducing the number of paired comparison tasks does not appear to influence response precision ; however , generalizability , practicality , and precautionary considerations remain .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , participants learned to respond efficiently within the first three tasks and did not resort to satisficing , but may have rounded their TTO responses .

OBJECTIVE	Most problematic alcohol users never seek professional help to reduce their use , and Web-based interventions might fulfill users ' unmet needs for professional support .
METHODS	This randomized controlled trial compared two open Web-based interventions , one extended self-help program and one brief screening and feedback intervention , with an assessment-only control group .
METHODS	Participants were @ Internet help seekers with at least hazardous alcohol use ( Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test , AUDIT @ for women and @ for men ) .
RESULTS	All groups reduced their alcohol use at @-month follow-up ( p < @ ) , remaining stable at the @ - and @-month follow-ups ( n.s. ) according to AUDIT-C and AUDIT scores ( intention-to-treat , ITT , analysis ) .
RESULTS	Per protocol ( PP ) analysis , including only participants who accessed the interventions and also reported accessing additional outside interventions during the trial , showed that about @ % of extended self-help participants moved from probable dependence , harmful or hazardous use to lower alcohol use levels at @ - and @ - and @-month follow-ups , compared to about @-@ % of brief intervention users and controls who accessed extra help ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	ITT analysis suggested parity over time for all interventions , including assessment only , in reducing problematic alcohol use .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , PP analysis suggested that cognitive-behavioral extended self-help in combination with other interventions was more effective in changing alcohol use than brief intervention or assessment only .

OBJECTIVE	The study objective was to determine the impact of diabetes on radial artery and saphenous vein graft occlusion and clinical outcomes more than @ years after coronary artery bypass surgery in the multicenter Radial Artery Patency Study ( NCT@ ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients aged less than @ years with triple-vessel disease undergoing coronary bypass surgery participated in this study .
METHODS	Angiographic follow-up occurred more than @ years after surgery with annual clinical follow-up .
METHODS	The primary objective was to compare the proportion of complete graft occlusion between radial artery and saphenous vein grafts among diabetic and nondiabetic persons .
METHODS	Additional objectives included determining predictors of complete graft occlusion and comparison of major adverse cardiac events defined by cardiac death , late myocardial infarction , and reintervention .
RESULTS	There were @ of @ patients ( @ % ) with diabetes ; @ patients ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- diabetic ) underwent late angiography at mean of @ years after surgery .
RESULTS	In diabetic patients , the proportion of complete graft occlusion was significantly lower in the radial grafts ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) than in the saphenous grafts ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) ( P = @ ) , and this was similar in nondiabetic patients ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate modeling showed that the use of the radial artery and high-grade target vessel stenosis were protective against late graft occlusion , whereas female gender , smoking history , and elevated creatinine were associated with an increased risk ; interaction between diabetic status and conduit type also was significant ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Major adverse cardiac events were higher in diabetic patients ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of the radial artery should be strongly considered in diabetic patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery , especially with high-grade target vessel stenosis .

BACKGROUND	Andropause and aging are associated with neuroendocrine dysfunctions .
BACKGROUND	Growth hormone and testosterone play a significant role in several processes affecting adaptation and thereby also everyday functioning .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this research project was to evaluate the effects of recombinant human growth hormone and testosterone enanthate injections on body mass and body composition , aerobic and anaerobic fitness and lipid profile in middle-aged men .
METHODS	The research group was comprised of @ men aged @ - @ years .
METHODS	Two series of laboratory analyses were performed .
METHODS	Independent tests were carried out at baseline and after @ weeks of the experiment .
METHODS	The data were analyzed using Statistica @ software .
RESULTS	A two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the intervention programme on fat-free mass ( ( @ ) = @ ) , total body fat ( ( @ ) = @ ) , total cholesterol ( ( @ ) = @ ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ( @ ) = @ ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ( @ ) = @ ) , triglyceride ( ( @ ) = @ ) , testosterone ( ( @ ) = @ ) , insulin-like growth factor @ ( ( @ ) = @ ) and growth hormone ( ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the rhGH and T treatment on maximal oxygen uptake ( ( @ ) = @ ) , anaerobic threshold ( ( @ ) = @ ) and maximal work rate ( ( @ ) = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It should be emphasized that the lipid profile was affected not only by rhGH + T replacement therapy , but also by the prescribed physical activity programme .
CONCLUSIONS	The strength and endurance fitness programme alone did not cause significant changes in body mass and composition , nor the anaerobic and aerobic capacity .
CONCLUSIONS	On the other hand , the rhGH = T treatment stimulated these changes significantly .

OBJECTIVE	Although medical intervention is the first option for treatment of nasal polyps , surgery is still a therapeutic option for symptomatic cases that do not respond or partially respond to medical intervention .
OBJECTIVE	However , there is a need for high-level evidence for the preoperative use of steroids in nasal polyposis surgery .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to assess the perioperative effect of preoperative use of oral prednisolone for advanced-stage diffuse nasal polyposis .
METHODS	Prospective , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study .
METHODS	A visual analog scale ( VAS ) was evaluated for smell , nasal discharge , nasal obstruction , facial pressure , headache , butanol smell threshold , and peak nasal inspiratory flow ( PNIF ) before and after the use of study drug .
METHODS	Perioperative bleeding volume , visibility of operative field , operative time , hospital stay , and complication rate were also evaluated .
RESULTS	The improvement in the corticosteroid group ( CG ) in the VAS scores , butanol thresholds , and PNIF values showed statistically significant differences compared to the placebo group ( PG ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The perioperative bleeding volume , visibility score , operative time , and hospital stay for CG/PG were @ mL/@ mL , @ / @ , @ min/@ @ min , and @ day/@ @ day , respectively ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The difference between the complication rates for the two groups did not show any statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative administration of systemic corticosteroids improves the perioperative visibility by reducing blood loss and shortens the operation time .
CONCLUSIONS	We recommend the use of preoperative corticosteroid for the safety of the patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The optimum dose and duration have not been established and require further studies .

BACKGROUND	Breastfeeding has countless benefits to mothers , children and community at large , especially in developing countries .
BACKGROUND	Studies from Lebanon report disappointingly low breastfeeding exclusivity and continuation rates .
BACKGROUND	Evidence reveals that antenatal breastfeeding education , professional lactation support , and peer lay support are individually effective at increasing breastfeeding duration and exclusivity , particularly in low-income settings .
BACKGROUND	Given the complex nature of the breastfeeding ecosystem and its barriers in Lebanon , we hypothesize that a complex breastfeeding support intervention , which is centered on the three components mentioned above , would significantly increase breastfeeding rates .
METHODS	A multi-center randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	@ healthy pregnant women in their first trimester will be randomized to control or intervention group .
METHODS	A `` prenatal/postnatal '' professional and peer breastfeeding support package continuing till @ months postpartum , guided by the Social Network and Social Support Theory .
METHODS	Control group will receive standard prenatal and postnatal care .
METHODS	Mothers will be followed up from early pregnancy till five years after delivery .
METHODS	Total and exclusive breastfeeding rates , quality of life at @ , @ and @ months postpartum , maternal breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes at @ months postpartum , maternal exclusive breastfeeding rates of future infants up to five years from baseline , cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of the intervention .
METHODS	Descriptive and regression analysis will be conducted under the intention to treat basis using the most recent version of SPSS .
CONCLUSIONS	Exclusive breastfeeding is a cost-effective public health measure that has a significant impact on infant morbidity and mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	In a country with limited healthcare resources like Lebanon , developing an effective breastfeeding promotion and support intervention that is easily replicated across various settings becomes a priority .

OBJECTIVE	Beta-blockers ( BBs ) improve outcomes in heart failure .
OBJECTIVE	Results from the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study in Elderly ( CIBIS-ELD ) trial previously demonstrated the feasibility of heart rate , not maximum dose , as a treatment goal .
OBJECTIVE	In this pre-specified analysis , we investigated the prognostic value of achieved heart rate after BB optimization on long-term mortality .
RESULTS	Elderly heart failure patients from the CIBIS-ELD trial were invited to participate in a follow-up examination @ years after the initial @-week BB up-titration period .
RESULTS	The relationship between all-cause mortality , BB dose , and heart rate after titration and potentially confounding clinical variables was analysed by multivariable Cox regression .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients ( @ % women ; mean age @ @ years ) were included .
RESULTS	During a mean follow-up period of @ @ months , @ patients ( @ % ) died , thus accumulating @ patient-years at risk .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in baseline heart rate for survivors and non-survivors ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In models adjusting for age , sex , BB pre-treatment , ventricular function , heart rate , and NYHA class at baseline , a heart rate increase by @ b.p.m. following up-titration was associated with a subsequent mortality hazard ratio of @ ( @ % confidence interval @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The heart rate range with the lowest mortality and the fewest treatment-related adverse events was @-@ b.p.m.
RESULTS	The achieved BB dose was not associated with mortality risk .
CONCLUSIONS	The heart rate after up-titration , but not BB dose , predicted all-cause mortality risk in elderly patients with chronic heart failure .
CONCLUSIONS	These patients should be titrated to resting heart rates between @ and @ b.p.m.

OBJECTIVE	Regional analgesic techniques are commonly used in pediatric urology .
OBJECTIVE	Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block has recently gained popularity .
OBJECTIVE	However , there is a paucity of information supporting a benefit over regional field infiltration .
OBJECTIVE	We present a parallel group , randomized , controlled trial evaluating ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block superiority over surgeon delivered regional field infiltration for children undergoing open pyeloplasty at a tertiary referral center .
METHODS	Following ethics board approval and registration , children @ to @ years old were recruited and randomized to undergo perioperative transversus abdominis plane block or regional field infiltration for early post-pyeloplasty pain control .
METHODS	General anesthetic delivery , surgical technique and postoperative analgesics were standardized .
METHODS	A blinded assessor regularly captured pain scores in the recovery room using the FLACC ( Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ) scale .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the need for rescue morphine administration based on a FLACC score of @ or higher .
RESULTS	Two pediatric urologists performed @ pyeloplasties during a @-year period , enrolling @ children ( @ in each group , balanced for age and weight ) .
RESULTS	There were statistically significant differences in the number of children requiring rescue morphine administration ( @ of @ receiving transversus abdominis plane block and @ of @ receiving regional field infiltration , p = @ ) , mean SD total morphine consumption ( @ @ vs @ @ mg/kg , p = @ ) and mean SD pain scores ( @ @ vs @ @ , p = @ ) in the recovery room , in favor of surgeon administered regional field infiltration .
RESULTS	No local anesthetic specific adverse events were noted .
CONCLUSIONS	Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block is not superior to regional field infiltration with bupivacaine as a strategy to minimize early opioid requirements following open pyeloplasty in children .
CONCLUSIONS	Instead , our data suggest that surgeon delivered regional field infiltration provides better pain control .

BACKGROUND	The addition of hydrophobically modified polymers ( HMPs ) to cleansers that contain surfactants can create polymer-surfactant complexes that are less irritating to the skin than commercially available mild cleansers .
BACKGROUND	Our objective was to compare the tolerability and efficacy of a test foaming liquid facial cleanser containing HMPs with a commercial liquid nonfoaming facial cleanser in women with sensitive skin .
METHODS	In this randomized , prospective , double-blind , comparative study , women ( n = @ per group ) with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , eczema , acne , or rosacea used a test gentle foaming liquid facial cleanser containing HMPs or a commercial gentle liquid nonfoaming facial cleanser daily for @weeks .
METHODS	Investigators assessed irritation and skin condition .
METHODS	Study subjects also assessed their skin properties and the performance of each cleanser .
RESULTS	Clinicians as well as study subjects consistently rated the test cleanser as effective or slightly more effective at improving symptoms than the commercial cleanser , although no significant differences between groups were observed .
RESULTS	At weeks @ and @ , respectively , more users of the commercial cleanser reported irritation ( @ % and @ % ) than users of the test cleanser ( @ % and @ % ) .
RESULTS	In addition , subject self-assessments of skin condition and cleansing properties were slightly more improved with the test cleanser than with the commercial cleanser .
CONCLUSIONS	Both the test foaming cleanser containing HMPs and the commercial nonfoaming cleanser were effective and well accepted by most women in the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Improvements were observed by both clinicians and subjects in the group using the test cleanser containing HMPs in all evaluated skin categories .

OBJECTIVE	To determine if intrauterine administration of @ cc of @ % lidocaine in addition to paracervical block reduces pain during laminaria insertion , when compared with paracervical block and saline placebo .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double blind placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Women presenting for abortion by dilation and evacuation ( D&E ) at @-@ weeks gestational age were randomized to receive an intrauterine instillation of either @ mL of @ % lidocaine or @ mL of normal saline , in addition to standard paracervical block with @ cc of @ % bupivacaine .
METHODS	Our primary outcome was self-reported pain scores on a @mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) immediately following laminaria insertion .
METHODS	Secondary outcome was self-reported VAS pain score indicating the maximum level of pain experienced during the @-@-h interval between laminaria insertion and D&E procedure .
RESULTS	Seventy-two women were enrolled , and data for @ women were analyzed , only two of whom were more than @ weeks on gestation .
RESULTS	The range of pain scores at both time points was large ( @-@ mm at laminaria insertion ; @-@mm in laminaria-D & E interval ) .
RESULTS	Mean pain scores were not different between treatment groups at laminaria insertion , ( @ vs. @ , p = @ ) or in the laminaria - D&E interval ( @ vs. @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intrauterine administration of @ cc of @ % lidocaine in addition to paracervical block did not reduce pain with laminaria insertion when compared to paracervical block with saline placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Intrauterine lidocaine combined with paracervical block does not improve pain control at laminaria insertion when compared with paracervical block and saline placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Wide variation in pain scores and persistent pain after laminaria insertion suggests patient would benefit from more effective methods of pain control at laminaria insertion and during the post-laminaria interval .

BACKGROUND	Our aim was to determine if a surgeon 's behaviors can encourage or discourage trainees from speaking up when they witness a surgical mistake .
METHODS	A randomized clinical trial in which medical students ( n = @ ) were randomly assigned to an `` encouraged '' ( n = @ ) or `` discouraged '' ( n = @ ) group .
METHODS	Participants underwent personality tests to assess decision-making styles , and were then trained on basic tasks ( `` burn '' then `` cut '' ) on a laparoscopic surgery simulator .
METHODS	After randomization , students assisted at a simulated laparoscopic salpingectomy .
METHODS	The senior surgeon used either an `` encourage '' script ( eg , `` Your opinion is important . '' )
METHODS	or a `` discourage '' script ( eg , `` Do what I say .
METHODS	Save questions for next time . '' )
METHODS	Otherwise , the surgery was conducted identically .
METHODS	Subsequently , a surgical mistake was made by the senior surgeon when he instructed students to cut without burning .
METHODS	Students were considered to have spoken up if they questioned the instruction and did not cut .
METHODS	Potential personality bias was assessed with two validated personality tests before simulation .
METHODS	Data were processed with Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests .
RESULTS	The students in the encouraged group were significantly more likely to speak up ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in personality traits , student training level ( p = @ ) , or sex ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A discouraging environment decreases the frequency with which trainees speak up when witnessing a surgical error .
CONCLUSIONS	The senior surgeon plays an important role in improving intraoperative communication between junior and senior clinicians and can enhance patient safety .

BACKGROUND	Despite growing emphasis on transitional care to reduce costs and improve quality , few studies have examined transitional care improvements in socioeconomically disadvantaged adults .
BACKGROUND	It is important to consider these patients separately as many are high-utilizers , have different needs , and may have different responses to interventions .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent transitional care improvement program on @-day readmissions , emergency department ( ED ) use , transitional care quality , and mortality .
METHODS	Clustered randomized controlled trial conducted at a single urban academic medical center in Portland , Oregon .
METHODS	Three hundred eighty-two hospitalized low-income adults admitted to general medicine or cardiology who were uninsured or had public insurance .
METHODS	Multicomponent intervention including ( @ ) transitional nurse coaching and education , including home visits for highest risk patients ; ( @ ) pharmacy care , including provision of @ days of medications after discharge for those without prescription drug coverage ; ( @ ) post-hospital primary care linkages ; ( @ ) systems integration and continuous quality improvement .
METHODS	Primary outcomes included @-day inpatient readmission and ED use .
METHODS	Readmission data were obtained using state-wide administrative data for all participants ( insured and uninsured ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included quality ( @-item Care Transitions Measure ) and mortality .
METHODS	Research staff administering questionnaires and assessing outcomes were blinded .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in @-day readmission between C-TraIn ( @/@ , @ % ) and control patients ( @/@ , @ % ) , p = @ , or in ED visits between C-TraIn ( @/@ , @ % ) and control ( @/@ , @ % ) , p = @ .
RESULTS	C-TraIn was associated with improved transitional care quality ; @ % ( @/@ ) of C-TraIn patients reported a high quality transition compared to @ % ( @/@ ) control patients , odds ratio @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Zero C-TraIn patients died in the @-day post-discharge period compared with five in the control group ( unadjusted p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	C-TraIn did not reduce @-day inpatient readmissions or ED use ; however , it improved transitional care quality .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect of heated , humidified , high-flow nasal cannula ( HHHFNC ) and nasal continuous positive airways pressure ( NCPAP ) on lung function and mechanics in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) at the same level of retropharyngeal pressure ( Prp ) .
METHODS	Randomised crossover trial .
METHODS	Neonatal intensive care unit , Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico , Milan , Italy .
METHODS	@ preterm infants ( gestational age : @ wks ) with mild-moderate RDS requiring non-invasive respiratory support within @ h after birth .
METHODS	Infants were exposed to a randomised sequence of NCPAP and HHHFNC at different settings ( @ , @ and @ cmHO for NCPAP and @ , @ , @ L/min for HHHFNC ) to enable comparison at the same level of Prp .
METHODS	Tidal volume by respiratory inductance plethysmography , pleural pressure estimated by oesophageal pressure , and gas exchange were evaluated at each setting and used to compute breathing pattern parameters , lung mechanics and work of breathing ( WOB ) .
RESULTS	A poor linear regression between flow and Prp was found during HHHFNC ( Prp = @ +@ * flow ; r = @ ) .
RESULTS	Only in @ out of @ infants it was possible to compare HHHFNC and NCPAP at a Prp of @ and @ cmHO .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences were found in breathing pattern , gas exchange , lung mechanics and total WOB .
RESULTS	Resistive WOB in the upper airways was slightly but significantly higher during HHHFNC ( @ ( @ ; @ ) vs @ ( @ ; @ ) cmHO median ( IQR ) ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite differing mechanisms for generating positive airway pressure , when compared at the same Prp , NCPAP and HHHFNC provide similar effects on all the outcomes explored .

BACKGROUND	Recurrent airway obstruction ( RAO ) , an asthma-like disease , is @ of the most common allergic diseases in horses in the northern hemisphere .
BACKGROUND	Hypersensitivity reactions to environmental antigens cause an allergic inflammatory response in the equine airways .
BACKGROUND	Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG-ODN ) are known to direct the immune system toward a Th@-pathway , and away from the pro-allergic Th@-line ( Th@/Th@-shift ) .
BACKGROUND	Gelatin nanoparticles ( GNPs ) are biocompatible and biodegradable immunological inert drug delivery systems that protect CpG-ODN against nuclease degeneration .
BACKGROUND	Preliminary studies on the inhalation of GNP-bound CpG-ODN in RAO-affected horses have shown promising results .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of GNP-bound CpG-ODN in a double-blinded , placebo-controlled , prospective , randomized clinical trial and to verify a sustained effect post-treatment .
METHODS	Twenty-four RAO-affected horses received @ inhalation every @ days for @ consecutive administrations .
METHODS	Horses were examined for clinical , endoscopic , cytological , and blood biochemical variables before the inhalation regimen ( I ) , immediately afterwards ( II ) , and @ weeks post-treatment ( III ) .
RESULTS	At time points I and II , administration of treatment rather than placebo corresponded to a statistically significant decrease in respiratory effort , nasal discharge , tracheal secretion , and viscosity , AaDO@ and neutrophil percentage , and an increase in arterial oxygen pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of a GNP-bound CpG-ODN formulation caused a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory-induced clinical variables in RAO-affected horses .
CONCLUSIONS	This treatment , therefore , provides an innovative , promising , and well-tolerated strategy beyond conventional symptomatic long-term therapy and could serve as a model for asthma treatment in humans .

OBJECTIVE	Some patients with lower leg amputations may be candidates for motorized prosthetic limbs .
OBJECTIVE	Optimal control of such devices requires accurate classification of the patient 's ambulation mode ( eg , on level ground or ascending stairs ) and natural transitions between different ambulation modes .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of including electromyographic ( EMG ) data and historical information from prior gait strides in a real-time control system for a powered prosthetic leg capable of level-ground walking , stair ascent and descent , ramp ascent and descent , and natural transitions between these ambulation modes .
METHODS	Blinded , randomized crossover clinical trial conducted between August @ and November @ in a research laboratory at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago .
METHODS	Participants were @ patients with unilateral above-knee ( n = @ ) or knee-disarticulation ( n = @ ) amputations .
METHODS	All patients were capable of ambulation within their home and community using a passive prosthesis ( ie , one that does not provide external power ) .
METHODS	Electrodes were placed over @ residual limb muscles and EMG signals were recorded as patients ambulated and completed @ circuit trials involving level-ground walking , ramp ascent and descent , and stair ascent and descent .
METHODS	Data were acquired simultaneously from @ mechanical sensors embedded on the prosthesis .
METHODS	Two real-time pattern recognition algorithms , using either ( @ ) mechanical sensor data alone or ( @ ) mechanical sensor data in combination with EMG data and historical information from earlier in the gait cycle , were evaluated .
METHODS	The order in which patients used each configuration was randomized ( @:@ blocked randomization ) and double-blinded so patients and experimenters did not know which control configuration was being used .
METHODS	The main outcome of the study was classification error for each real-time control system .
METHODS	Classification error is defined as the percentage of steps incorrectly predicted by the control system .
RESULTS	Including EMG signals and historical information in the real-time control system resulted in significantly lower classification error ( mean , @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ) across a mean of @ steps ( range , @-@ steps ) compared with using mechanical sensor data only ( mean , @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ) across a mean of @ steps ( range , @-@ steps ) , with a mean difference between groups of @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study of @ patients with lower limb amputations , inclusion of EMG signals and temporal gait information reduced classification error across ambulation modes and during transitions between ambulation modes .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary findings , if confirmed , have the potential to improve the control of powered leg prostheses .

OBJECTIVE	To measure choroidal thickness on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD OCT ) images using automated algorithms and to correlate choroidal pathology with retinal changes attributable to diabetic macular edema ( DME ) .
METHODS	Post hoc analysis of multicenter clinical trial baseline data .
METHODS	SD OCT raster scans/fluorescein angiograms were obtained from @ treatment-nave eyes of @ patients with clinically significant DME and from @ controls .
METHODS	Three-dimensional ( @D ) SD OCT images were evaluated by a certified independent reading center analyzing retinal changes associated with diabetic retinopathy .
METHODS	Choroidal thicknesses were analyzed using a fully automated algorithm .
METHODS	Angiograms were assessed manually .
METHODS	Multiple endpoint correction according to Bonferroni-Holm was applied .
METHODS	Main outcome measures were average retinal/choroidal thickness on fovea-centered or peak of edema ( thickest point of edema ) - centered Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid , maximum area of leakage , and the correlation between retinal and choroidal thicknesses .
RESULTS	Total choroidal thickness is significantly reduced in DME ( @ @ m ; P = @ ) and nonedematous fellow eyes ( @ @ m ; P = @ ) of patients compared with healthy control eyes ( @ @ m ) .
RESULTS	Retinal/choroidal thickness values showed no significant correlation ( @-mm : P = @ , r ( @ ) = @ ; @-mm : P = @ , r ( @ ) < @ ; @-mm : P = @ , r ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found in the @ - or @-mm circle of a retinal peak of edema-centered grid .
RESULTS	All other measurements of choroidal/retinal thickness ( DME vs healthy , DME vs peak of edema-centered , DME vs fellow , healthy vs fellow , peak of edema-centered vs healthy , peak of edema-centered vs fellow eyes ) were compared but no statistically significant correlation was found .
RESULTS	By tendency a thinner choroid correlates with larger retinal leakage areas .
CONCLUSIONS	Automated algorithms can be used to reliably assess choroidal thickness in eyes with DME .
CONCLUSIONS	Choroidal thickness was generally reduced in patients with diabetes if DME is present in @ eye ; however , no correlation was found between choroidal/retinal pathologies , suggesting different pathogenetic pathways .

BACKGROUND	This update of a randomized , prospective study presents the effect of external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) on long-term overall survival , local control , and limb function following limb-sparing surgery ( LSS ) for the treatment extremity soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) .
METHODS	Following LSS , patients with extremity STS were randomized to receive EBRT or surgery alone .
METHODS	All patients with high-grade STS received adjuvant chemotherapy .
METHODS	Long-term follow-up was obtained through telephone interviews using a questionnaire based on validated methods .
METHODS	Overall survival ( OS ) was determined by Kaplan-Meier method .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients with extremity STS were randomized to receive adjuvant EBRT ( n = @ ) or LSS alone ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ years .
RESULTS	The @ - and @-year survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) for patients receiving LSS alone and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ % ) for patients receiving EBRT ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who completed telephone interviews , the incidence of local recurrence during the follow-up period was @ % ( @ of @ ) in the LSS alone cohort compared with @ % ( @ of @ ) in those who received EBRT ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients treated with EBRT tended to have more wound complications ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) , clinically significant edema ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) , and functional limb deficits ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Adjuvant EBRT following surgery for STS of the extremity provides excellent local control with acceptable treatment-related morbidity and no statistically significant improvement in overall survival .

OBJECTIVE	In this pilot study we evaluated the feasibility of and methods for assessing the quality of life of long term survivors of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) phase III clinical trials .
OBJECTIVE	Here we report the results pertaining to the feasibility of conducting such research .
METHODS	In this cross-sectional study , we recruited long-term , disease-free survivors from two mature EORTC clinical trials in testicular and prostate cancer from centres in Northern and Southern Europe , and the United Kingdom ( UK ) .
RESULTS	A number of challenges were encountered in recruiting participating centres , obtaining medical ethical approval and in recruiting survivors and collecting the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) data in a timely manner .
RESULTS	The efficiency with which the study could be conducted varied widely across centres and countries .
RESULTS	Time to obtain medical ethical approval for the study ranged from @ to @ months .
RESULTS	We encountered most problems with ethical approval in the UK , Italy and Belgium .
RESULTS	In most cases , data collection was completed within @ months ( range @ weeks-@ year ) .
RESULTS	Completed questionnaires were obtained from @ % and @ % , respectively , of the testicular and prostate cancer survivors who were approached .
CONCLUSIONS	HRQoL research among long-term survivors of EORTC phase III clinical trials is possible , but the process of ethical approval and data collection is a lengthy one .
CONCLUSIONS	To minimise many of the logistical problems , long-term follow-up of patients should be an integral part of future clinical trials .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , regulations governing medical ethical approval for clinical research within the EU should be carefully evaluated to facilitate long-term follow-up of cancer survivors in Europe .

BACKGROUND	The serum collection under the abdominal flap is the most common complication after a lipo-abdominoplasty .
BACKGROUND	The frequency of seroma increases further among obese patients , who have achieved massive weight loss after bariatric surgery .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of fibrin glues with a low concentration of thrombin in reducing seroma formation after a lipo-abdominoplasty .
METHODS	Thirty patients , that had achieved a significant weight loss after an intervention of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) , underwent a circular lipo-abdominoplasty at our bariatric surgery department .
METHODS	Patients were divided into two groups of @ subjects each : group A underwent traditional surgery ; in group B , we applied a slow-clotting variant of fibrin glue ( ARTISS , Baxter ) under the abdominal flap .
METHODS	All subjects were evaluated clinically using an ultrasound device on postoperative day @ .
METHODS	We considered positive for seroma , those cases with a liquid collection greater than @ cc .
RESULTS	The groups were homogeneous for age , BMI , male/female ratio , and diabetic or smoker patients .
RESULTS	The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group A than in group B.
RESULTS	We found eight cases of serum collection > @ cc in group A and only one case in group B. Hematoma , umbilicus necrosis , and surgical site infection occurred in both groups , but overall complication rate was lower in group B.
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin could be useful during wound closure and may decrease seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing lipo-abdominoplasty .

BACKGROUND	Children with pulmonary hypertension routinely undergo pulmonary vascular resistance studies to assess the disease severity and vasodilator responsiveness .
BACKGROUND	It is vital that results are accurate and reliable and are not influenced by the choice of anaesthetic agent .
BACKGROUND	However , there are anecdotal data to suggest that propofol and inhalational agents have different effects on pulmonary vascular resistance .
METHODS	A total of @ children with pulmonary hypertension were selected sequentially to be included in the study .
METHODS	To avoid confounding because of baseline anatomic or demographic details , a crossover protocol was implemented , using propofol or isoflurane , with time for washout in between each agent and blinding of the interventionalist .
RESULTS	Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance were not significantly different when using propofol or isoflurane .
RESULTS	However , the calculated resistance fraction - ratio of pulmonary resistance to systemic resistance - was significantly lower when using propofol than when using isoflurane .
CONCLUSIONS	Although no difference in pulmonary vascular resistance was demonstrated , this pilot study suggests that the choice of anaesthetic agent may affect the calculation of relative pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance , and provides some preliminary evidence to favour propofol over isoflurane .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings require replication in a larger study , and thus they should be considered in future calculations to make informed decisions about the management of children with pulmonary hypertension .

BACKGROUND	Dirofilaria repens is the causative agent of subcutaneous dirofilariosis of dogs , other animals and humans .
BACKGROUND	This nematode is transmitted by mosquitoes of Aedes , Anopheles and Culex genera .
BACKGROUND	In dogs , the parasite may cause subclinical infection or cutaneous signs .
BACKGROUND	Recently , D. repens has emerged and spread in different geographical areas , with an increase of cases in dogs and humans .
BACKGROUND	Chemoprevention in dogs in endemic areas is the most reliable approach for controlling this infection .
BACKGROUND	This paper describes a randomized , blocked and multicentric clinical field study investigating the efficacy of an oral , chewable formulation containing milbemycin oxime/praziquantel ( Milbemax , Novartis Animal Health ) in the chemoprevention of subcutaneous dirofilariosis in dogs .
METHODS	This study was conducted in endemic areas of Italy .
METHODS	A total of @ dogs , at two sites , negative for D. repens , were allocated into two groups ( i.e. Treated - T@ vs Untreated-T@ ) with a ratio of @:@ , and subjected to clinical visits and blood sampling once monthly until the end of the study .
METHODS	All blood samples were microscopically and genetically examined .
METHODS	Animals belonging to T@ group received a minimum target dose of @ mg/kg bodyweight of milbemycin oxime and @ mg/kg of praziquantel in commercial tablets ( Milbemax ) according body weight once every @ weeks .
METHODS	Animals of group T@ were not treated with Milbemax but received , when necessary , specific parasiticide treatments .
METHODS	The study duration was @ @ days for each dog .
RESULTS	A total of @ dogs completed the study ( i.e. @ in T@ and @ in T@ ) , while @ dogs ( i.e. @ in T@ , @ in T@ ) were withdrawn for a variety of reasons unrelated to administration of Milbemax .
RESULTS	The percentages of animals not showing microfilariae of D. repens were @ % ( @ animals ) in T@ and @ % ( @ animals out of @ ) in group T@ .
RESULTS	Milbemax was shown to be safe in treated dogs .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study confirm that the monthly use of Milbemax in dogs is effective and safe for the prevention of subcutaneous dirofilariosis in endemic areas .

BACKGROUND	Pharmacokinetically guided ( PK-guided ) versus body surface area-based @-fluorouracil ( @-FU ) dosing results in higher response rates and better tolerability .
BACKGROUND	A paucity of data exists on PK-guided @-FU dosing in the community setting .
METHODS	Seventy colorectal cancer patients , from one academic and five community cancer centers , received the mFOLFOX@ regimen ( @-FU @,@ mg/m ( @ ) over @ hours every @ weeks ) with or without bevacizumab at cycle @ .
METHODS	The @-FU continuous-infusion dose was adjusted for cycles @-@ using a PK-guided algorithm to achieve a literature-based target area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) .
METHODS	The primary objective was to demonstrate that PK-guided @-FU dosing improves the ability to achieve a target AUC within four cycles of therapy .
METHODS	The secondary objective was to demonstrate reduced incidence of @-FU-related toxicities .
RESULTS	At cycles @ and @ , @ % and @ % of patients achieved the target AUC ( @-@ mg hour/L ) , respectively ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- : @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients were within range at cycle @ compared with a literature rate of @ % ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients had significantly higher odds of not being underdosed at cycle @ versus cycle @ ( OR : @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The odds of a patient being within range increased by @ % at each subsequent cycle ( OR : @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Less grade @/@ mucositis and diarrhea were observed compared with historical data ( @ % vs @ % and @ % vs @ % , respectively ) ; however , rates of grade @/@ neutropenia were similar ( @ % vs @ % -@ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	PK-guided @-FU dosing resulted in significantly fewer underdosed patients and less gastrointestinal toxicity and allows for the application of personalized colorectal cancer therapy in the community setting .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the side effects unrelated to disease activity and the acceptability of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) , progestin-only pills ( POPs ) and copper-releasing intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) in women with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) .
METHODS	A randomized clinical trial including @ women with SLE , assigned to COC ( n = @ ) , POP ( n = @ ) or IUD ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Follow-up visits were conducted after @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ months of treatment to monitor the presence of symptoms , changes in body weight and blood pressure as well as the development of health problems other than those relating to lupus .
METHODS	Reasons for discontinuation and satisfaction with the use of the assigned method were recorded at the end of treatment .
METHODS	Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics , repeated measure analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves .
RESULTS	Significantly different discontinuation rates due to any reason -LSB- @ % , @ % , @ % ( p < @ ) -RSB- or nonmedical reasons -LSB- ( @ % , @ % , @ % ( p < @ ) -RSB- were observed among the COC , POP and IUD groups .
RESULTS	Nausea was most frequent among COC users , dysmenorrhea among IUD users and acne and hirsutism among POP users .
RESULTS	Mean blood pressures remained unchanged .
RESULTS	Mild increases in body weight were observed over time in all treatment groups .
RESULTS	Most women were satisfied with the use of the assigned contraceptive method .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral contraceptives and IUD are acceptable birth control methods for patients with lupus , when counseling and specialized health attention are provided ; however , the acceptability of POP appears to be inferior .
CONCLUSIONS	Side effects unrelated to lupus disease activity are not frequent reasons to discontinue the contraceptive methods .
CONCLUSIONS	This study delves into an area that has not been explored among patients with lupus .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings on the associated side effects and reasons for discontinuing COCs , POPs or copper-bearing IUDs may be useful in improving contraceptive counseling for women with lupus .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , they also heighten our knowledge on the reasons that may preclude the widespread use of effective contraceptives among lupus patients .

BACKGROUND	Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a frequent concern when treating solar lentigines .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the safety and efficacy of a triple combination cream with fluocinolone acetonide @ % , hydroquinone @ % and tretinoin @ % as adjuvant to cryotherapy in the treatment of solar lentigines in hands dorsum , and in the prevention of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation after cryotherapy .
METHODS	This prospective , randomized , controlled , investigator-blinded , single-centre study enrolled @ patients .
METHODS	Twenty-five patients received a @-week daily triple combination cream plus sunscreen pre-treatment and @ received sunscreen alone .
METHODS	After that , cryotherapy was performed in all patients followed by a @-week recovery period .
METHODS	After this period , patients received the same initial treatment and were followed up for @weeks .
METHODS	Melanin and erythema levels of a target and a control lentigo were objectively measured using a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer .
METHODS	Lentigines count , colour homogeneity and global improvement were also assessed .
RESULTS	The number of solar lentigines reduced in the first @weeks only in patients who used the triple combination @ vs. @ ( P < @ ) , and reduced at the end of the study for both groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The melanin levels also reduced in the first @weeks only in patients who used the triple combination @ vs. @ ( P < @ ) and reduced at the end of the study for both groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Erythema and residual blisters from cryotherapy were the reported adverse reactions .
CONCLUSIONS	Triple combination cream can be used to enhance the resolution of solar lentigines , and to significantly reduce melanin levels and lentigines count , improving treatment results .
CONCLUSIONS	It was well-tolerated and did not increase the occurrence of neither erythema nor other side-effects after the cryotherapy .

OBJECTIVE	Triage of HPV screen-positive women is needed to identify those with underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade @/@ or worse ( CIN@/@ + ) .
OBJECTIVE	Presently , cytology on a physician-taken cervical scrape is mostly accepted as triage test , but needs follow-up testing in order not to miss severe disease .
OBJECTIVE	Here , we evaluated the performance of combined cytology and bi-marker CADM@/MAL-methylation analysis as triage test on physician-taken cervical scrapes of HPV positive women .
METHODS	In this post-hoc analysis , we used @ left-over HPV positive cytology triage samples of participants of a randomized controlled trial ( PROHTECT-@ : n = @,@ ) performed in population-based cervical screening .
METHODS	Study endpoints were CIN@ + and CIN@ + detection .
METHODS	Cytology testing with and without methylation marker analysis was evaluated with regard to sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive value , and referral rate .
RESULTS	Bi-marker CADM@/MAL-methylation positivity increased proportionally with severity of underlying lesions .
RESULTS	Overall , cytology and bi-marker CADM@/MAL-methylation analysis yielded similar performances with regard to CIN@ + detection , yet in combination a significantly higher sensitivity for CIN@ + ( @ % ) was obtained at a specificity of @ % and a colposcopy referral rate of @ % .
RESULTS	The combined strategy detected all six cervical cancers , whereas triage by cytology alone failed to detect two of them .
CONCLUSIONS	Cytology and bi-marker CADM@/MAL-methylation analysis perform complementary for CIN@ + / CIN@ + detection when used as triage tool on cervical scrapes of HPV positive women .
CONCLUSIONS	This approach not only results in a higher CIN@ + sensitivity than cytology triage with an acceptable referral rate , but also seems to reduce the risk of missing cervical cancers and advanced high-grade lesions .

OBJECTIVE	Prevention of iron deficiency in infancy may promote neurodevelopment .
OBJECTIVE	Delayed cord clamping ( DCC ) can prevent iron deficiency during the first @ months of life .
OBJECTIVE	However , no data are available on long-term effects on infant outcomes in relation to time for umbilical cord clamping .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate effects of DCC , as compared with early cord clamping ( ECC ) , on infant iron status and neurodevelopment at age @ months in a European setting .
METHODS	Randomized clinical trial of @ full-term infants born after a low-risk pregnancy at a Swedish county hospital .
METHODS	Follow-up at @ months included evaluation of iron status ( ferritin level , transferrin saturation , transferrin receptor level , reticulocyte hemoglobin level , and mean cell volume ) and parental assessment of neurodevelopment by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire , second edition ( ASQ ) .
METHODS	Infants were randomized to DCC ( @ seconds after delivery ) or ECC ( @ seconds after delivery ) .
METHODS	The main outcome was iron status at age @ months ; the secondary outcome was ASQ score .
RESULTS	In total , @ of @ infants ( @ % ) were assessed .
RESULTS	The DCC and ECC groups did not differ in iron status ( mean ferritin level , @ vs @ ng/mL , respectively ; P = @ ) or neurodevelopment ( mean ASQ total score , @ vs @ , respectively ; P = @ ) at age @ months .
RESULTS	Predictors of ferritin levels were infant sex and ferritin in umbilical cord blood .
RESULTS	Predictors of ASQ score were infant sex and breastfeeding within @ hour after birth .
RESULTS	For both outcomes , being a boy was associated with lower results .
RESULTS	Interaction analysis showed that DCC was associated with an ASQ score @ points higher among boys ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- score , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- for DCC vs @ -LSB- @ -RSB- for ECC ) but @ points lower among girls ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- score , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- for DCC vs @ -LSB- @ -RSB- for ECC ) , out of a maximum of @ points ( P = @ for the interaction term ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Delayed cord clamping did not affect iron status or neurodevelopment at age @ months in a selected population of healthy term-born infants .
CONCLUSIONS	However , it may not be possible to demonstrate minor effects on neurodevelopment with the size of the study population and the chosen method for assessment .
CONCLUSIONS	The current data indicate that sex may influence the effects on infant development after DCC in different directions .
CONCLUSIONS	The magnitude and biological reason for this finding remain to be investigated .
CONCLUSIONS	TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Treatment for CH-C contains interferon with substantial associated side effects and health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) impairment .
OBJECTIVE	Currently , there is no published data assessing the impact of interferon-free regimens on HRQL .
OBJECTIVE	The aim is to report the HRQL of patients who participated in clinical trials of sofosbuvir ( SOF ) for CH-C .
METHODS	CH-C patients were treated with sofosbuvir ( SOF ) , pegylated interferon ( PegIFN ) , ribavirin ( RBV ) , or placebo in different combinations and duration ( POSITRON , FISSION , FUSION , and NEUTRINO phase III trials ) .
METHODS	HRQL was assessed using SF-@ at baseline , during treatment , at the end of treatment , and at follow-up , and compared between treatment arms .
RESULTS	HRQL scores decreased over the course of treatment for all treatment arms in all studies ; however , patients returned to their baseline score by the end of follow-up .
RESULTS	Compared to placebo , SOF and RBV was not associated with HRQL impairment ( POSITRON ) .
RESULTS	Compared to SOF and RBV , HRQL was significantly more impaired in the PegIFN and RBV arm ( FISSION ) .
RESULTS	For those treated with SOF and RBV , there was no difference in HRQL between @ weeks or @ weeks of treatment ( FUSION ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that depression , fatigue , and insomnia were important predictors of patients ' HRQL prior , during or after treatment .
RESULTS	Additionally , anemia and receiving interferon were predictors of HRQL impairment during treatment .
RESULTS	Achieving sustained virologic response after @ weeks of follow-up ( SVR-@ ) with SOF and RBV was associated with improvement in HRQL scores from baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment-related HRQL impairment during SOF and RBV regimen is mild , and does not increase with longer treatment duration .
CONCLUSIONS	Achieving SVR-@ with SOF and RBV is associated with an improvement in HRQL .

BACKGROUND	High - and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS ) has been shown to be beneficial for upper limb hemiparesis in patients with acute stroke .
BACKGROUND	However , no study has examined the usefulness of bilateral application of HF - and LF-rTMS ( BL-rTMS ) .
METHODS	Fifty-eight hemiparetic patients with acute stroke were randomly assigned into two groups : HF-rTMS group and BL-rTMS group .
METHODS	All patients were scheduled to receive five sessions of either HF-rTMS over the lesional hemisphere or BL-rTMS over both hemispheres for @ days .
METHODS	Motor function of the affected upper limb was evaluated using the Brunnstrom Recovery Stage ( BRS ) for upper-limb and hand-fingers , grip strength and tapping frequency , before the first session and after the last session of rTMS .
RESULTS	Improvement of BRS for the upper limb and hand/finger was significantly greater in the BL-rTMS group than the HF-rTMS group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Improvement in grip strength and tapping frequency was also greater in the BL-rTMS group , although the differences were not statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	The proposed BL-rTMS is safe and feasible and showed a greater improvement of BRS of the affected upper limb compared to HF-rTMS .
CONCLUSIONS	This novel rTMS approach may be a useful intervention for hemiparetic patients with acute stroke .

BACKGROUND	The evaluation of intestinal trophism , mainly the mucosal layer , is an important issue in various conditions associated with injury , atrophy , recovery , and healing of the gut .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of the proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes by immunohistochemistry and to assess the complexity of intestinal mucosa by fractal dimension ( FD ) analysis in Solea solea fed different experimental diets .
RESULTS	Histomorphological evaluation of all intestinal segments did not show signs of degeneration or inflammation .
RESULTS	Cell proliferation index and FD were significantly reduced with a diet high in mussel meal ( MM ; p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) , while apoptotic index did not show any significant difference for the same comparison ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Linear regression analysis between apoptotic index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) showed a statistically significant inverse relationship ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Linear regression analysis between cell proliferation index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) did not show any significant correlation ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results demonstrated that diets containing increasing levels of mussel meal in substitution of fishmeal did not incite a hyperplastic response of the intestinal mucosa .
CONCLUSIONS	The mussel meal , which is derived from molluscs , could mimic the characteristics of the sole 's natural prey , being readily digestible , even without increasing the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa .
CONCLUSIONS	Interestingly , from this study emerged that FD could be used as a numeric indicator complementary to in situ quantification methods to measure intestinal trophism , in conjunction with functional parameters .

OBJECTIVE	It is unclear whether d-cycloserine ( DCS ) , a partial N-methyl-d-aspartate agonist that enhances fear extinction , can augment the effects of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) for obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
OBJECTIVE	To examine whether DCS augments the effects of CBT for OCD and to explore ( post hoc ) whether concomitant antidepressant medication moderates the effects of DCS .
METHODS	A @-week , double-blind randomized clinical trial with @-month follow-up conducted at an academic medical center between September @ , @ , and September @ , @ .
METHODS	Participants included @ adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of OCD and a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) score of @ or higher .
METHODS	Concurrent antidepressant medication was permitted if the dose had been stable for at least @ months prior to enrollment and remained unchanged during the trial .
METHODS	The main analysis was by intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	All participants received a previously validated Internet-based CBT protocol over @ weeks and were randomized to receive either @ mg of DCS or placebo , administered @ hour before each of @ exposure and response prevention tasks .
METHODS	Clinician-administered Y-BOCS score at week @ and at @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Remission was defined as a score of @ or lower on the Y-BOCS .
RESULTS	In the primary intention-to-treat analyses , DCS did not augment the effects of CBT compared with placebo ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- clinician-rated Y-BOCS score , DCS : @ -LSB- @ -RSB- at week @ and @ -LSB- @ -RSB- at @-month follow-up ; placebo : @ -LSB- @ -RSB- at week @ and @ -LSB- @ -RSB- at @-month follow-up ) but showed a significant interaction with antidepressants ( clinician-rated Y-BOCS , B = -@ ; Z = -@ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Post hoc analyses revealed that antidepressants significantly impaired treatment response in the DCS group but not the placebo group , at both posttreatment and follow-up ( clinician-rated Y-BOCS : t@ = -@ ; P = @ ; and t@ = -@ ; P < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	In the DCS group , a significantly greater proportion of antidepressant-free patients achieved remission status at follow-up ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ) than antidepressant-medicated patients ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Antidepressants had no effect in the placebo group ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- remission rate in both groups ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings suggest that antidepressants may interact with DCS to block its facilitating effect on fear extinction .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of DCS may be a promising CBT augmentation strategy but only in antidepressant-free patients with OCD .

BACKGROUND	Acute heart failure ( AHF ) is characterized by inadequate cardiac output ( CO ) , congestive symptoms , poor peripheral perfusion and end-organ dysfunction .
BACKGROUND	Treatment often includes a combination of diuretics , oxygen , positive pressure ventilation , inotropes and vasodilators or vasopressors .
BACKGROUND	Lactate is a marker of illness severity but is also an important metabolic substrate for the myocardium at rest and during stress .
BACKGROUND	We tested the effects of half-molar sodium lactate infusion on cardiac performance in AHF .
METHODS	We conducted a prospective , randomised , controlled , open-label , pilot clinical trial in @ patients fulfilling two of the following three criteria for AHF : ( @ ) left ventricular ejection fraction < @ % , ( @ ) acute pulmonary oedema or respiratory failure of predominantly cardiac origin requiring mechanical ventilation and ( @ ) currently receiving vasopressor and/or inotropic support .
METHODS	Patients in the intervention group received a @ ml/kg bolus of half-molar sodium lactate over the course of @ minutes followed by @ ml/kg/h continuous infusion for @ hours .
METHODS	The control group received only a @ ml/kg bolus of Hartmann 's solution without continuous infusion .
METHODS	The primary outcome was CO assessed by transthoracic echocardiography @ hours after randomisation .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included a measure of right ventricular systolic function ( tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE ) ) , acid-base balance , electrolyte and organ function parameters , along with length of stay and mortality .
RESULTS	The infusion of half-molar sodium lactate increased ( meanSD ) CO from @ L/min to @ L/min ( P < @ ) and TAPSE from @ mm to @ mm ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Plasma sodium and pH increased ( @ to @ and @ to @ , respectively ; both P < @ ) , but potassium , chloride and phosphate levels decreased .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the need for vasoactive therapy , respiratory support , renal or liver function tests , duration of ICU and hospital stay or @ - and @-day mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Infusion of half-molar sodium lactate improved cardiac performance and led to metabolic alkalosis in AHF patients without any detrimental effects on organ function .

BACKGROUND	Experimental data indicate that reducing factor XI levels attenuates thrombosis without causing bleeding , but the role of factor XI in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis in humans is unknown .
BACKGROUND	FXI-ASO ( ISIS @ ) is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that specifically reduces factor XI levels .
BACKGROUND	We compared the efficacy and safety of FXI-ASO with those of enoxaparin in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty .
METHODS	In this open-label , parallel-group study , we randomly assigned @ patients who were undergoing elective primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty to receive one of two doses of FXI-ASO ( @ mg or @ mg ) or @ mg of enoxaparin once daily .
METHODS	The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( assessed by mandatory bilateral venography or report of symptomatic events ) .
METHODS	The principal safety outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding .
RESULTS	Around the time of surgery , the mean ( SE ) factor XI levels were @ units per milliliter in the @-mg FXI-ASO group , @ units per milliliter in the @-mg FXI-ASO group , and @ units per milliliter in the enoxaparin group .
RESULTS	The primary efficacy outcome occurred in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) who received the @-mg dose of FXI-ASO and in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) who received the @-mg dose of FXI-ASO , as compared with @ of @ patients ( @ % ) who received enoxaparin .
RESULTS	The @-mg regimen was noninferior , and the @-mg regimen was superior , to enoxaparin ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Bleeding occurred in @ % , @ % , and @ % of the patients in the three study groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	This study showed that factor XI contributes to postoperative venous thromboembolism ; reducing factor XI levels in patients undergoing elective primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty was an effective method for its prevention and appeared to be safe with respect to the risk of bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by Isis Pharmaceuticals ; FXI-ASO TKA ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

BACKGROUND	Inhalation of capsaicin , the extract of hot chili peppers , induces coughing in both animals and human subjects through activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid @ ( TRPV@ ) on airway sensory nerves .
BACKGROUND	Therefore the TRPV@ receptor is an attractive target for the development of antitussive agents .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to assess the antitussive effect of TRPV@ antagonism in patients with refractory chronic cough .
METHODS	Twenty-one subjects with refractory chronic cough ( > @ weeks ) attending a specialist clinic were recruited to a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial assessing a TRPV@ antagonist ( SB-@ ) .
METHODS	Cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin ( concentration of capsaicin inducing at least @ coughs ) and @-hour cough frequency were coprimary end points assessed after a single dose of SB-@ ( @ mg ) and matched placebo .
METHODS	Cough severity and urge to cough were reported on visual analog scales , and cough-specific quality of life data were also collected .
RESULTS	Treatment with SB-@ produced a significant improvement in cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin at @ hours and a borderline significant improvement at @ hours compared with placebo ( adjusted mean difference of +@ doubling doses at @ hours -LSB- @ % CI , +@ to +@ ; P = @ -RSB- and +@ doubling doses at @ hours -LSB- @ % CI , +@ to +@ ; P = @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	However , @-hour objective cough frequency was not improved compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Patient-reported cough severity , urge to cough , and cough-specific quality of life similarly suggested no effect of SB-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	This study raises important questions about both the role of TRVP@-mediated mechanisms in patients with refractory chronic cough and also the predictive value of capsaicin challenge testing in the assessment of novel antitussive agents .

METHODS	Multicenter retrospective population study , with validation of linear , biphasic linear , differential , power , and quadratic equations .
METHODS	Two clinical pathology laboratories .
METHODS	A new cohort of @,@ women aged @ to @ years old attending infertility clinics , randomly divided into a training cohort of @,@ women and a validation cohort of @,@ women , and an existing cohort of @,@ women , who had contributed to the development and validation of a nomogram for AMH measured by the DSL assay .
METHODS	Serum measurement of AMH as determined by the Beckman Coulter AMH Generation II assay in @,@ women .
METHODS	Optimal model for the decline in AMH as measured by the AMH Gen II assay with age , with age-specific @th , @th , @th , @th , @th , @th , and @th percentiles .
RESULTS	A quadratic model defined as ( @ + @ * Age + -@ * Age ( @ ) ) fitted the decline in AMH with age .
RESULTS	The anticipated @ % increase in age-specific population values relative to the previously validated DSL assay nomogram was not observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Age-specific reference ranges for the AMH gen II assay suggest a systematic shift in assay calibration since initial evaluation and commercial release of the AMH Gen II assay .

BACKGROUND	Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) is a condition characterized by memory problems that are more severe than the normal cognitive changes due to aging , but less severe than dementia .
BACKGROUND	Reduced working memory ( WM ) is regarded as one of the core symptoms of an MCI condition .
BACKGROUND	Recent studies have indicated that WM can be improved through computer-based training .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study is to evaluate if WM training is effective in improving cognitive function in elderly patients with MCI , and if cognitive training induces structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain , as assessed by structural MRI .
METHODS	The proposed study is a blinded , randomized , controlled trail that will include @ elderly patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital-based memory clinic .
METHODS	The participants will be randomized to either a training program or a placebo version of the program .
METHODS	The intervention is computerized WM training performed for @minutes of @ sessions over @weeks .
METHODS	The placebo version is identical in duration but is non-adaptive in the difficulty level of the tasks .
METHODS	Neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI will be performed before and @ month after training , and at a @-month folllow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	If computer-based training results in positive changes to memory functions in patients with MCI this may represent a new , cost-effective treatment for MCI .
CONCLUSIONS	Secondly , evaluation of any training-induced structural changes to gray or white matter will improve the current understanding of the mechanisms behind effective cognitive interventions in patients with MCI .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient 's perceived pain response to injection and anesthetic deposition for the greater palatine nerve block .
METHODS	Heft-Parker Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) pain scale measurements were used to compare the following techniques for the injection : ( @ ) control ( no concurrent stimulation ) , ( @ ) pressure , ( @ ) pressure and topical anesthetic ( @ % benzocaine ) , and ( @ ) pressure and cold ( TFE ) .
METHODS	Forty-two volunteers , @ male and @ female , participated in the study .
METHODS	A bilateral model was used on each patient to give an injection on each side of the palate with two different techniques followed by the next appointment ( > or = two weeks later ) , when the two other injection techniques were used .
METHODS	Following injection given in the supine position , the patients were returned to an upright position and asked to rate their pain on a VAS .
RESULTS	Pain upon needle insertion appears less than that of anesthetic deposition .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in perceived pain response among the four techniques , the visit , the order , the side , or patient gender at either time point .
RESULTS	Following the application of Endo Ice , @ % of participants reported a sore on their palate occurring two to @ hours after cold application and persisting for one to @ days .
RESULTS	The pain score for this injection had a mean value of @ % ( @ / @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This prospective , single-blind study evaluating three injection techniques to reduce posterior palatal injection pain to a control injection method showed no significant reduction in pain with any of the three techniques .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , @,@,@,@-tetrafluoroethane placed with pressure for @ seconds appeared injurious to the oral mucosa .

BACKGROUND	Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) has been shown to improve glucose control in adults with type @ diabetes .
BACKGROUND	Effectiveness of CGM is directly linked with CGM adherence , which can be challenging to maintain in children and adolescents .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that initiating CGM at the same time as starting insulin pump therapy in pump nave children and adolescents with type @ diabetes will result in greater CGM adherence and effectiveness compared to delaying CGM introduction by @ months , and that this is related to greater readiness for making behaviour change at the time of pump initiation .
METHODS	The CGM TIME Trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Eligible children and adolescents ( @-@ years ) with established type @ diabetes were randomized to simultaneous initiation of pump ( Medtronic Veo ) and CGM ( Enlite ) or to standard pump therapy with delayed CGM introduction .
METHODS	Primary outcomes are CGM adherence and hemoglobin A@C at @ and @ months post pump initiation .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include glycemic variability , stage of readiness , and other patient-reported outcomes with follow-up to @ months .
METHODS	@ ( @ % ) of the @ eligible patients were enrolled and randomized .
METHODS	Allowing for @ % withdrawals , this will provide @ % power to detect a between group difference in CGM adherence and @ % power to detect a between group difference in hemoglobin A@C .
METHODS	Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups .
METHODS	Analysis of @ month primary outcomes will begin in September @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The CGM TIME Trial is the first study to examine the relationship between timing of CGM initiation , readiness for behaviour change , and subsequent CGM adherence in pump nave children and adolescents .
CONCLUSIONS	Its findings will advance our understanding of when and how to initiate CGM in children and adolescents with type @ diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	Early statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome reduces atherothrombotic vascular events .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to compare the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic statins on myocardial salvage and left ventricular ( LV ) function in patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
METHODS	Seventy-five STEMI patients who had received emergency reperfusion therapy were enrolled and randomized into the hydrophilic statin group ( rosuvastatin ; @ mg/day , n = @ ) and hydrophobic statin group ( atorvastatin ; @ mg/day , n = @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , and B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) and co-enzyme Q@ ( CoQ@ ) levels were measured at baseline and the end of treatment .
METHODS	The myocardial salvage index was assessed by single photon emission computed tomography with ( @ - ) I -- methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid ( ischemic area-at-risk at onset of STEMI : AAR ) and ( @ - ) thallium scintigraphy ( area-at-infarction at @ months : AAI ) -LSB- myocardial salvage index = ( AAR-AAI ) @/AAR ( % ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	Onset-to-balloon time and maximum creatine phosphokinase levels were comparable between the groups .
RESULTS	After @ months , rosuvastatin ( -@ % @ % ) and atorvastatin ( -@ % @ % ) equally reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , rosuvastatin ( +@ % @ % , p < @ ) , but not atorvastatin ( +@ % @ % , p = @ ) , improved LVEF .
RESULTS	Rosuvastatin reduced BNP levels compared with atorvastatin ( -@ % @ % versus -@ % @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The myocardial salvage index was significantly higher in the rosuvastatin group than the atorvastatin group ( @ % @ % versus @ % @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	CoQ@/LDL-C levels at @ months were increased in the rosuvastatin group ( +@ % , p < @ ) and percent changes in CoQ@/LDL-C were correlated with the myocardial salvage index ( r = @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Rosuvastatin shows better beneficial effects on myocardial salvage than atorvastatin in STEMI patients , including long-term cardiac function , associated with increasing CoQ@/LDL-C .

BACKGROUND	In assessing quality of care in developing countries , retrospectively collected data are usually used given their availability .
BACKGROUND	Retrospective data however suffer from such biases as recall bias and non-response bias .
BACKGROUND	Comparing results obtained using prospectively and retrospectively collected data will help validate the use of the easily available retrospective data in assessing quality of care in past and future studies .
METHODS	Prospective and retrospective datasets were obtained from a cluster randomized trial of a multifaceted intervention aimed at improving paediatric inpatient care conducted in eight rural Kenyan district hospitals by improving management of children admitted with pneumonia , malaria and diarrhea and/or dehydration .
METHODS	Four hospitals received a full intervention and four a partial intervention .
METHODS	Data were collected through @ two weeks surveys conducted at baseline , after @ and @ months .
METHODS	Retrospective data was sampled from paediatric medical records of patients discharged in the preceding six months of the survey while prospective data was collected from patients discharged during the two week period of each survey .
METHODS	Risk Differences during post-intervention period of @ quality of care indicators were analyzed separately for prospective and retrospective datasets and later plotted side by side for comparison .
RESULTS	For the prospective data there was strong evidence of an intervention effect for @ of the indicators and weaker evidence of an effect for one indicator , with magnitude of effect sizes varying from @ % to @ % difference .
RESULTS	For the retrospective data , @ process ( these include the @ indicators found to be statistically significant in prospective data analysis ) indicators had statistically significant differences with magnitude of effects varying from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	The bar-graph comparing results from the prospective and retrospective datasets showed similarity in terms of magnitude of effects and statistical significance for all except two indicators .
CONCLUSIONS	Multifaceted interventions can help improve adoption of clinical guidelines and hence improve the quality of care .
CONCLUSIONS	The similar inference reached after analyses based on prospective assessment of case management is a useful finding as it supports the utility of work based on examination of retrospectively assembled case records allowing longer time periods to be studied while constraining costs .

OBJECTIVE	Poor patient understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plan can adversely impact clinical outcome following hospital discharge .
OBJECTIVE	Discharge summaries are primarily written for the doctor rather than the patient .
OBJECTIVE	We determined patient understanding of the reasons for hospitalisation , in-hospital tests , treatments and post-discharge recommendations , and whether a brief patient-directed discharge letter ( PADDLE ) delivered during a brief discussion prior to discharge would improve understanding .
METHODS	A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted , including @ hospitalised patients .
METHODS	After a baseline questionnaire , patients were randomised to receive the PADDLE letter or usual care .
METHODS	Those receiving the letter had an immediate follow-up questionnaire .
METHODS	Patient understanding was compared with a summary letter written by the treating clinician , using a @-point Likert scale ranging from none to full understanding .
METHODS	A questionnaire was administered at @ and @ months .
RESULTS	At baseline , patients had almost full understanding ( median score @ ) of reasons for hospitalisation and treatments .
RESULTS	However , despite high self-appraisal , patients objectively had very little understanding of tests performed and post-discharge recommendations ( median @ ) .
RESULTS	Those receiving the letter had an immediate increase to almost full understanding ( median @ ) of tests performed ( P < @ ) and to full understanding ( median @ ) of post-discharge recommendations .
RESULTS	This increase did not persist at @ or @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	A simple patient-directed letter delivered during a brief discussion improves patient understanding of their hospitalisation and post-discharge recommendations , which is otherwise limited .
CONCLUSIONS	Further evaluation of this brief and well-received intervention is indicated , with the goal of improving patient understanding , satisfaction and clinical outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Patient reported outcome measures ( PROMs ) are used to evaluate lifestyle interventions but little is known about differences between patients returning valid and invalid responses , or of potential for bias in evaluations .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to examine the characteristics of patients who returned valid responses to lifestyle questionnaires compared to those whose responses were invalid for evaluating lifestyle change .
METHODS	We conducted a secondary data analysis from the SPHERE Study , a trial of an intervention to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease in primary care .
METHODS	Postal questionnaires were used to assess physical activity ( Godin ) and diet ( DINE ) among study participants at baseline and @ month follow-up .
METHODS	Three binary response variables were generated for analysis : ( @ ) valid Godin score ; ( @ ) valid DINE Fibre score ; and ( @ ) valid DINE Total Fat score .
METHODS	Multivariate analysis comprised generalised estimating equation regression to examine the association of patients ' characteristics with their return of valid responses at both timepoints .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % of participants ( @/@ ) returned questionnaires at both baseline and @ months .
RESULTS	Relatively fewer valid Godin scores were returned by those who left school aged < @ years ( @ % ) than aged @ and over ( @ % ) , manual workers ( @ % ) than non-manual ( @ % ) and those with an elevated cholesterol ( > @ mmol ) ( @ % ) than those with a lower cholesterol ( @ % ) but multivariate analysis identified that only school leaving age ( p = @ ) was of statistical significance.Relatively fewer valid DINE scores were returned by manual than non-manual workers ( fibre : @ % v @ % ; fat : @ % v @ % ) , smokers ( fibre : @ % v @ % ; fat : @ % v @ % ) , patients with diabetes ( fibre : @ % v @ % ; fat : @ % v @ % ) and those with cholesterol > @ mmol ( fat : @ % v @ % ) but multivariate analysis showed statistical significance only for smoking ( fibre : p = @ ; fat : p = @ ) , diabetes ( fibre : p = @ ; fat : p = @ ) , and cholesterol ( fat : p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings illustrate the importance of detailed reporting of research methods , with clear information about response rates , respondents and valid outcome data .
CONCLUSIONS	Outcome measures which are relevant to a study population should be chosen carefully .
CONCLUSIONS	The impact of methods of outcome measurement and valid response rates in evaluating healthcare requires further study .

BACKGROUND	Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is a progressive disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	Current therapies improve symptoms , functional capacity , and , in select cases , survival .
BACKGROUND	Little is known about patient factors that may predict the likelihood of patient-important , clinically relevant responses to therapy such as the @-min walk distance ( @MWD ) and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) .
METHODS	Data from the randomized clinical trial of tadalafil in PAH were used .
METHODS	Adjusted logistic regression models were created to examine the relationship between baseline characteristics and odds of achieving the minimal important difference ( MID ) in three parameters , defined as either a > @-m increase in @MWD , a > @-unit increase in physical component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-@ ( SF-@ ) , or a > @-unit increase in mental component summary score of the SF-@ .
RESULTS	The study included @ subjects .
RESULTS	Younger age , male sex , lower baseline @MWD , and disease etiology were associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the @-min walk test .
RESULTS	Active treatment , younger age , and male sex were associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the physical component summary score .
RESULTS	Male sex was associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the mental component summary score .
CONCLUSIONS	Age , sex , baseline functional capacity , and disease etiology are variably associated with the likelihood of achieving clinically relevant responses in patient-important outcomes to PAH-specific therapy such as @MWD and HRQoL .
CONCLUSIONS	The increased likelihood of response in men compared with women is a novel finding and may reflect pathophysiologic differences between sexes .

BACKGROUND	Vascular calcification is a potent predictor of plaque instability and cardiac events .
BACKGROUND	Osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , well-known vascular calcification mediator , is a signaling molecule involved in bone remodeling , which has been implicated in the regulation of vascular calcification and atherogenesis .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the combination treatments of olmesartan/azelnidipine and olmesartan/diuretics on serum bone-related markers in patients with essential hypertension .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients with hypertension treated with @ mg olmesartan were randomized to receive combination treatment with @ mg azelnidipine ( O/A group ) or diuretics ( @ mg indapamide ; O/D group ) for @ months .
RESULTS	Osteoprotegerin , matrix metalloproteinase @ ( MMP-@ ) , and high-sensitive CRP ( hs-CRP ) were measured after @ and @ months of treatment .
RESULTS	Cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) was measured as the arterial stiffness using a VaSera CAVI instrument at the same time points .
RESULTS	In both groups , the systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction is similar .
RESULTS	Serum OPG , MMP-@ , and hs-CRP were significantly decreased at @ months in the O/A group ( P < @ ) , while there were no significant reductions in the O/D group .
RESULTS	CAVI was significantly improved at @ months in both the treatment groups .
RESULTS	The improvement in CAVI was significantly greater in the O/A group than in the O/D group .
CONCLUSIONS	Azelnidipine , but not indapamide , combined with olmesartan , improved arterial stiffness and were associated with significant decrease in OPG , MMP-@ , and hs-CRP concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that the beneficial effects of the combination treatments of olmesartan/azelnidipine on arterial stiffness are mediated by alteration in bone-remodeling and inflammatory markers .

BACKGROUND	Excessive alcohol use is a prevalent and worldwide problem .
BACKGROUND	Excessive drinking causes a significant burden of disease and is associated with both morbidity and excess mortality .
BACKGROUND	Prototype alteration and provision of a cue reminder could be useful strategies to enhance the effectiveness of online tailored interventions for excessive drinking .
OBJECTIVE	Through a Web-based randomized controlled trial , @ strategies ( ie , prototype alteration and cue reminders ) within an existing online personalized feedback intervention ( Drinktest ) aimed to reduce adults ' excessive drinking .
OBJECTIVE	It was expected that both strategies would add to Drinktest and would result in reductions in alcohol consumption by intrinsic motivation and the seizure of opportunities to act .
METHODS	Participants were recruited online and through printed materials .
METHODS	Excessive drinking adults ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to @ conditions : original Drinktest , Drinktest plus prototype alteration , Drinktest plus cue reminder , and Drinktest plus prototype alteration and cue reminder .
METHODS	Evaluation took place at @-month posttest and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Differences in drinking behavior , intentions , and behavioral willingness ( ie , primary outcomes ) were assessed by means of longitudinal multilevel analyses using a last observation carried forward method .
METHODS	Measures were based on self-reports .
RESULTS	All conditions showed reductions in drinking behavior and willingness to drink , and increased intentions to reduce drinking .
RESULTS	Prototype alteration ( B = -@ , P < @ ) and cue reminder usage ( B = -@ , P < @ ) were both more effective in reducing alcohol consumption than when these strategies were not provided .
RESULTS	Combining the strategies did not produce a synergistic effect .
RESULTS	No differences across conditions were found regarding intentions or willingness .
CONCLUSIONS	Although individuals ' awareness of their cue was reasonable , their reported alcohol consumption was nevertheless reduced .
CONCLUSIONS	Individuals appeared to distance their self-image from heavier drinking prototypes .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , prototype alteration and cue reminder usage may be feasible and simple intervention strategies to promote reductions in alcohol consumption among adults , with an effect up to @ months .

METHODS	A total of @ hospitalized adult English-speaking patients .
METHODS	The @-Item Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-@ ) was used to screen patients for depressive symptoms .
METHODS	Hospital readmission within @ days of discharge .
METHODS	Poisson regression was used to control for confounding variables .
RESULTS	There were @ ( @ % ) patients who screened positive for mild depressive symptoms ( @ PHQ-@ @ ) and @ ( @ % ) for moderate or severe depressive symptoms ( PHQ-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	After controlling for confounders , a higher rate of readmission was observed in subjects with mild depressive symptoms compared to subjects with PHQ-@ < @ , incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The adjusted IRR of readmission for those with moderate-to-severe symptoms was @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) compared to those with no depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Screening positive for mild and moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms during a hospitalization on a general medical service is associated with an increased dose-dependent readmission rate within @ days of discharge in an urban , academic , safety-net hospital .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to determine whether treatments targeting the reduction of depressive symptoms reduce the risk of readmission .

OBJECTIVE	This randomized , double-blind @ week study compared the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose treatment with vortioxetine ( @mg/day ) and venlafaxine extended release ( XR ) ( @mg/day ) in major depressive disorder ( MDD ) patients .
METHODS	Patients aged @-@ years with a primary diagnosis of recurrent MDD , a Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score @ and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity ( CGI-S ) score @ were randomized ( @:@ ) to treatment with either vortioxetine or venlafaxine XR .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week @ in MADRS total score ( analysis of covariance -LSB- ANCOVA -RSB- , full-analysis set -LSB- FAS -RSB- , last observation carried forward -LSB- LOCF -RSB- ) , using a non-inferiority margin of +@ points .
METHODS	Pre-specified secondary endpoints included MADRS response and remission rates , anxiety symptoms ( HAM-A ) , CGI , overall functioning ( SDS ) , and health-related quality of life ( Q-LES-Q ) .
BACKGROUND	This study ( SOLUTION ) has the www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT@ .
RESULTS	On the primary efficacy endpoint at Week @ , non-inferiority was established with a difference of -@ MADRS points in favor of vortioxetine ( @ % CI : -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The MADRS total score decreased ( improved ) from @ at baseline to @ ( vortioxetine : n = @ ) and from @ to @ ( venlafaxine XR : n = @ ) ( FAS , LOCF ) .
RESULTS	At Week @ , the HAM-A and SDS total scores , CGI and Q-LES-Q scores , and response and remission rates demonstrated similar improvement for vortioxetine and venlafaxine XR , with remission rates ( MADRS @ ) of @ % ( vortioxetine ) versus @ % ( venlafaxine XR ) ( LOCF ) .
RESULTS	Fewer vortioxetine than venlafaxine XR patients withdrew for any reason ( @ % versus @ % ) or for adverse events ( @ % versus @ % ) .
RESULTS	The most frequent adverse events ( @ % ) for both treatments were nausea , dizziness , headache , and dry mouth .
RESULTS	In addition , accidental overdose , decreased appetite , constipation and insomnia were reported by ( @ % ) of patients treated with venlafaxine XR .
CONCLUSIONS	The inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Since patients with a history of lack of response to venlafaxine XR were excluded from this study , there is a selection bias in favor of venlafaxine XR .
CONCLUSIONS	Vortioxetine was at least as efficacious as venlafaxine XR and was safe and better tolerated than venlafaxine XR .

OBJECTIVE	Empiric antibiotic monotherapy is considered the standard of treatment for febrile neutropenic patients with cancer , but this approach may be inadequate because of the increasing prevalence of infections caused by multidrug resistant ( MDR ) bacteria .
METHODS	In this multicenter , open-label , randomized , superiority trial , adult , febrile , high-risk neutropenic patients ( FhrNPs ) with hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned to receive piperacillin/tazobactam ( @ g intravenously every @ hours ) with or without tigecycline ( @ mg intravenously every @ hours ; loading dose @ mg ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was resolution of febrile episode without modifications of the initial allocated treatment .
RESULTS	Three hundred ninety FhrNPs were enrolled ( combination/monotherapy , @/@ ) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis ( ITTA ) .
RESULTS	The ITTA revealed a successful outcome in @ % v @ % of patients who had received combination therapy and monotherapy , respectively ( @/@ v @/@ ; absolute difference in risk ( adr ) , @ % ; @ % CI , @ % to @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The combination regimen proved better than monotherapy in bacteremias ( adr , @ % ; @ % CI , @ % to @ % ; P < @ ) and in clinically documented infections ( adr , @ % ; @ % CI , @ % to @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Mortality and number of adverse effects were limited and similar in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and tigecycline is safe , well tolerated , and more effective than piperacillin/tazobactam alone in febrile , high-risk , neutropenic hematologic patients with cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	In epidemiologic settings characterized by a high prevalence of infections because of MDR microorganisms , this combination could be considered as one of the first-line empiric antibiotic therapies .

METHODS	Randomized , double-blinded , crossover trial .
METHODS	Twenty-three US sleep centers .
METHODS	Eighty-five individuals with moderate to severe idiopathic RLS and associated sleep disturbance .
METHODS	Participants were randomized across @ treatment sequences comprising three @-week periods on pregabalin @ mg/day ( n = @ ) , pramipexole @ mg/day ( n = @ ) , or placebo ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Polysomnography was conducted over @ nights at the end of each period .
RESULTS	Primary ( wake after sleep onset -LSB- WASO -RSB- , pregabalin vs placebo ) and key secondary endpoints were analyzed for statistical significance , with descriptive statistics for other endpoints .
RESULTS	Pregabalin improved sleep maintenance , demonstrated by reductions in WASO ( -@ min vs placebo -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ; -@ vs pramipexole ) and number of awakenings after sleep onset ( -@ vs placebo ; -@ vs pramipexole -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) by polysomnography , and an increase in subjective total sleep time ( @ min vs placebo -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ; @ vs pramipexole ) .
RESULTS	Pregabalin also increased slow wave sleep duration ( @ min vs placebo ; @ vs pramipexole -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Reduction in periodic limb movement arousal index ( PLMAI ) with pregabalin was similar to pramipexole and greater than placebo ( -@ PLMA/h -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) , although reduction in total PLM in sleep was less than for pramipexole .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrated improvements in objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture with pregabalin compared with placebo and pramipexole .
CONCLUSIONS	Effects of pregabalin on periodic limb movement arousal index were comparable to pramipexole .

OBJECTIVE	Limited data exist on radial access in carotid artery stenting .
OBJECTIVE	This multicentre prospective randomised study was performed to compare the outcome and complication rates of transradial and transfemoral carotid artery stenting .
RESULTS	The clinical and angiographic data of @ consecutive patients with high risk for carotid endarterectomy , treated between @ and @ by carotid stenting with cerebral protection , were evaluated .
RESULTS	Patients were randomised to transradial ( n = @ ) or transfemoral ( n = @ ) groups and several parameters were evaluated .
RESULTS	Primary combined endpoint : major adverse cardiac and cerebral events , rate of access-site complications .
RESULTS	Secondary endpoints : angiographic outcome of the procedure , fluoroscopy time and X-ray dose , procedural time , crossover rate to another puncture site and hospitalisation in days .
RESULTS	Procedural success was achieved in all @ patients ( @ % ) , the crossover rate was @ % in the TR and @ % in the TF group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A major access-site complication was encountered in one patient ( @ % ) in the TR group and in one patient ( @ % ) in the TF group ( p = ns ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events was @ % in the TR and @ % in the TF group ( p = ns ) .
RESULTS	Procedure time ( @,@ -LSB- @,@-@ ,@ -RSB- vs. @,@ -LSB- @,@-@ ,@ -RSB- sec , p = ns ) and fluoroscopy time ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- sec , p = ns ) were not significantly different , but the radiation dose was significantly higher in the TR group ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- Gy * cm@ , p < @ ) by per-protocol analysis .
RESULTS	Hospitalisation days were significantly lower in the TR group ( @ vs. @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	By intention-to-treat analysis there was a significantly higher radiation dose in the TR group ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p < @ ) , but no difference in major events ( @ vs. @ , p = ns ) and length of hospitalisation in days ( @ vs. @ , p = ns ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The transradial approach for carotid artery stenting is safe and efficacious ; however , the crossover rate is higher with transradial access .
CONCLUSIONS	There are no differences in the total procedure duration and fluoroscopy time between the two approaches but the radiation dose is significantly higher in the radial group , and the hospitalisation is shorter with the use of transradial access by per-protocol analysis .
CONCLUSIONS	By evaluating the patient data according to intention-to-treat analysis we found no difference in major adverse events and hospitalisation .
CONCLUSIONS	In both groups , vascular complications rarely occurred .

OBJECTIVE	Here , we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA vaccine , HB-@ , in mice and Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) undergoing adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) treatment .
METHODS	For animal study , mice ( BALB/c or HBV transgenic ) were immunized with mHB-@ , and T-cell and antibody responses were evaluated .
METHODS	For clinical study , @ patients randomly received either ADV alone or ADV in combination with HB-@ .
METHODS	Liver function tests , serum HBV DNA levels and the presence of HBeAg/anti-HBe were analysed .
METHODS	T-cell responses were estimated by ELISPOT and FACS analysis .
RESULTS	mHB-@ induced higher T-cell and antibody responses than mHB-@ in mice .
RESULTS	No adverse effects were observed by HB-@ cotreated with ADV. HBV-specific T-cell responses were induced in a portion of patients in medium to high dose of HB-@ .
RESULTS	Interestingly , HB-@ exhibited positive effects on ALT normalization and maintenance of HBeAg seroconversion .
RESULTS	One patient , who received high dose of HB-@ exhibited HBeAg seroconversion during vaccination , which correlated with vaccine-induced T-cell responses without ALT elevation .
CONCLUSIONS	HB-@ was safe and tolerable in CHB patients .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast to results in animal models , HB-@ in Korean patients exhibited weaker capability of inducing HBV-specific T-cell responses and HBeAg seroconversion than HB-@ in Caucasian patients .
CONCLUSIONS	As Asian patients , who are generally infected via vertical transmission , appeared to have higher level of immune tolerance than Caucasian , novel approaches for breaking immune tolerance rather than enhancing immunogenicity may be more urgently demanded to develop effective therapeutic HBV DNA vaccines .

BACKGROUND	The commonality between chronic conditions that are treated with low-dose ketamine , such as specific chronic pain conditions , depression , and post-traumatic stress disorder , can be found in relation to the stress system , particularly the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis .
BACKGROUND	In this study we assess the effect of ketamine on the stress system by measuring plasma and saliva cortisol production during and following exposure to low-dose ketamine .
METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study , the influence of subanaesthetic ketamine ( @ mg kg ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) for @ h , followed by @ mg kg ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) for another hour ) was studied with repeated plasma and saliva cortisol samples in @ healthy male volunteers .
METHODS	A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was used to describe the circadian rhythm-dependent ketamine-induced production of cortisol .
RESULTS	The endogenous mean baseline cortisol production was @ ( SE @ ) nM min ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	Consistent with the circadian rhythm , cortisol production decayed by @ nM min ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	Ketamine doubled the cortisol production at a concentration of @ ( SE @ ) ng ml ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	The salivary cortisol concentration closely mirrored the plasma concentration and was exponentially related to the plasma concentration with , at @ ng ml ( -@ ) ketamine , a saliva : plasma ratio of @ ( se @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Ketamine has an appreciable effect on cortisol production .
CONCLUSIONS	This may impact on critical physiological and psychological functions .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of @ weeks of aerobic training performed at two different intensities on nitric oxide ( tNOx ) availability and iNOS/nNOS expression , oxidative stress ( OS ) and inflammation in obese humans with or without type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) .
METHODS	Twenty-five sedentary , obese ( BMI > @ kg/m@ ) males ( @ @ years ) ; @ controls versus @ T@DM were randomly allocated to four groups that exercised for @ min , three times per week either at low ( Fat-Max ; @-@ % VO ( @max ) ) or moderate ( T ( vent ) ; @-@ % VO ( @max ) ) intensity .
METHODS	Before and after training , blood and muscle samples ( v. lateralis ) were collected .
RESULTS	Baseline erythrocyte glutathione was lower ( @ @ vs. @ @ nmol/ml ) and plasma protein oxidative damage and IL-@ were higher in T@DM ( @ @ vs. @ @ nmol/ml ) .
RESULTS	Plasma catalase increased in T@DM after T ( vent ) training ( from @ @ to @ @ nmol/min/ml ) .
RESULTS	T@DM groups demonstrated evidence of oxidative damage in response to training ( elevated protein carbonyls ) .
RESULTS	Baseline serum tNOx were higher in controls than T@DM ( @ @ vs. @ @ mol/l ) .
RESULTS	Training at T ( vent ) increased muscle nNOS and tNOx in the control group only .
RESULTS	Pre-training muscle nNOS was higher in controls than in T@DMs , while the opposite was found for iNOS .
RESULTS	No differences were found after training for plasma inflammatory markers .
CONCLUSIONS	Exercise training did not change body composition or aerobic fitness , but improved OS markers , especially when performed at T ( vent ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Non-diabetics responded to T ( vent ) training by increasing muscle nNOS expression and tNOx levels in skeletal muscle while these parameters did not change in T@DM , perhaps due to higher insulin resistance ( unchanged after intervention ) .

BACKGROUND	Rapid HIV testing in high-risk populations can increase the number of persons who learn their HIV status and avoid spending clinic resources to locate persons identified as HIV infected .
METHODS	We determined the cost to sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) clinics of point-of-care rapid HIV testing using data from @ public clinics that participated in a randomized trial of rapid testing with and without brief patient-centered risk reduction counseling in @ .
METHODS	Costs included counselor and trainer time , supplies , and clinic overhead .
METHODS	We applied national labor rates and test costs .
METHODS	We calculated median clinic start-up costs and mean cost per patient tested , and projected incremental annual costs of implementing universal rapid HIV testing compared with current testing practices .
RESULTS	Criteria for offering rapid HIV testing and methods for delivering nonrapid test results varied among clinics before the trial .
RESULTS	Rapid HIV testing cost an average of US $ @/patient without brief risk reduction counseling and US $ @/patient with counseling in these @ clinics .
RESULTS	Median start-up costs per clinic were US $ @ and US $ @,@ without and with counseling , respectively .
RESULTS	Estimated incremental annual costs per clinic of implementing universal rapid HIV testing varied by whether or not brief counseling is conducted and by current clinic testing practices , ranging from a savings of US $ @,@ to a cost of US $ @,@ without counseling and a cost of US $ @,@ to US $ @,@ with counseling .
CONCLUSIONS	Universal rapid HIV testing in STD clinics with same-day results can be implemented at relatively low cost to STD clinics , if brief risk reduction counseling is not offered .

METHODS	Following a @-week drug tapering/initiation period , patients without TD were treated with OLZ or CNV for up to @ year .
METHODS	The a priori defined primary outcome end point was persistent TD defined as Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) scores = @ on at least @ items or @ on at least @ item ( items @-@ ) lasting at least for @ month ( Criterion A ) .
METHODS	Post hoc analyses assessed persistent TD meeting the criterion of moderate severity defined as AIMS score @ on at least @ item persisting for @ month ( Criterion B ) and probable TD defined as elevated AIMS scores ( Criterion A or B ) not persisting for @ month .
METHODS	Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank exact test .
RESULTS	On average , patients were @ years of age ; the predominant diagnosis was dementia ( @ % in the OLZ group and @ % in the CNV group ) .
RESULTS	Approximately , @ % of patients in the CNV group received haloperidol .
RESULTS	No significant difference in time to developing persistent TD was observed during treatment with OLZ or CNV ( cumulative incidence : OLZ , @ % -LSB- @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- : @-@ @ -RSB- ; CNV , @ % -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The exposure-adjusted event rates per @ person-years were not significantly different between treatment groups : OLZ ( @ ) and CNV ( @ ; ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Post hoc analyses revealed a significantly lower risk of at least moderately severe persistent TD persisting for @ month ( P = @ ) and probable TD not persisting for @ month ( Criterion A , P = @ ; Criterion B , P = @ ) in OLZ-treated patients .
RESULTS	For those patients without significant extrapyramidal symptoms at baseline , significantly more patients in the CNV treatment group developed treatment-emergent parkinsonism than for patients in the OLZ treatment group ( CNV : @ % , @ of @ patients ; OLZ @ % , @ of @ patients ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference between the groups was observed for treatment-emergent akathisia ( CNV : @ % , @ of @ patients ; OLZ : @ % , @ of @ patients ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The cumulative incidence of persistent TD was low and the risk of persistent TD did not differ significantly among predominantly older adult patients having dementia with acute psychosis or agitation treated with OLZ or CNV .

BACKGROUND	Characteristics and outcomes of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction receiving care at Veterans Affairs ( VA ) versus non-VA hospitals have not been previously reported .
RESULTS	In the randomized controlled Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial ( BEST ; @-@ ) , of the @ ( bucindolol = @ ; placebo = @ ) patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction @ % , @ received care at VA hospitals , of which @ % ( n = @ ) were male .
RESULTS	Of the @ receiving care at non-VA hospitals , @ % ( n = @ ) were male .
RESULTS	Our analyses were restricted to these @ male patients .
RESULTS	VA patients were older with higher symptom and comorbidity burdens .
RESULTS	There was no significant between-group difference in unadjusted primary end point of @-year all-cause mortality ( @ % VA versus @ % non-VA ; hazard ratio associated with VA hospitals , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) , which remained unchanged after adjustment for age and race ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) or multivariable adjustment , including cardiovascular morbidities ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no between-group difference in cause-specific mortalities or hospitalizations .
RESULTS	Chronic kidney disease , pulmonary edema , left ventricular ejection fraction < @ % , and peripheral arterial disease were significant predictors of mortality for both groups .
RESULTS	African America race , New York Heart Association class IV symptoms , atrial fibrillation , and right ventricular ejection fraction < @ % were associated with higher mortality among non-VA hospital patients only ; however , these differences from VA patients were not significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction receiving care at VA hospitals were older and sicker ; yet their risk of mortality and hospitalization was similar to younger and healthier patients receiving care at non-VA hospitals .

OBJECTIVE	There has been no systematic investigation of the individual and combined effects of impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) and obesity on cognitive function in the absence of ageing .
OBJECTIVE	The aims were to examine the effects of IGT and increased waist circumference on cognitive function in ostensibly healthy adults , and to investigate whether a low glycaemic load ( GL ) breakfast can attenuate cognitive impairments in these populations .
RESULTS	Sixty five females aged @-@ years were classified into one of four groups following waist circumference ( WC ) measurements and an oral glucose tolerance test : NGT/low WC ( n = @ ) , NGT/high WC ( n = @ ) , IGT/low WC ( n = @ ) , IGT/high WC ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Memory , psychomotor and executive functions were examined @ and @ min after consuming low GL , high GL and water breakfasts according to a randomised , crossover , counterbalanced design .
RESULTS	IGT was associated with impairment of verbal and spatial memory , and psychomotor function relative to females with NGT , independent of waist circumference .
RESULTS	Increased waist circumference was associated with impairment of verbal memory and executive function relative to females with low WC , independent of IGT .
RESULTS	Consumption of the LGL breakfast attenuated verbal memory impairment in the IGT/high WC group relative to the HGL breakfast and no energy control .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased central adiposity and abnormalities in glucose tolerance preceding type @ diabetes can have demonstrable negative effects on cognitive function , even in ostensibly healthy , middle-aged females .
CONCLUSIONS	The potential for GL manipulations to modulate glycaemic response and cognitive function in type @ diabetes and obesity merits further investigation .

BACKGROUND	Tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope is taught to medical students as it is a lifesaving procedure .
BACKGROUND	However , it is a difficult technique to learn and the consequences of intubation failure are potentially serious .
BACKGROUND	The Airtraq optical laryngoscope is a relatively novel intubation device , which allows visualization of the glottic plane without alignment of the oral , pharyngeal , and tracheal axes , possessing advantages over Macintosh for novice personnel .
BACKGROUND	We introduced a teaching mode featured with a progressive evaluation scheme for preparation and performance of tracheal intubation with medical students in this prospective randomized crossover trial who had no prior airway management experience to find the superior one .
METHODS	Twenty-six medical students of the @-year programme in the @th year participated in this trial , when they did their one-week rotation in the department of anaesthesiology .
METHODS	Each of the students intubated @ patients , who were scheduled for surgeries under general anaesthesia , each laryngoscope for @ patients respectively .
METHODS	One hundred and forty-nine consecutive patients scheduled for surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated to undergo tracheal intubation using Macintosh ( n = @ ) or Airtraq ( n = @ ) laryngoscope .
METHODS	The progressive evaluation scheme was applied to each intubation attempt .
RESULTS	Intubation success rate was significantly higher in Airtraq group than Macintosh group ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Duration of glottis exposure was significantly shorter in Airtraq group compared to Macintosh group ( @ @ s vs. @ @ s , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A grade I Cormack and Lehane glottic view was obtained in @ % of patients in the Airtraq group versus @ % of patients in the Macintosh group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Duration of intubation in Airtraq group was significantly shorter ( @ @ s vs. @ @ s , P < @ ) compared to Macintosh group .
CONCLUSIONS	Airtraq laryngoscope is easier to master for novice personnel with a higher intubation success rate and shorter intubation duration compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope .

BACKGROUND	Previously considered as a disease of the affluent , west or urban people and not of public health importance , diabetes mellitus is increasingly becoming a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa .
BACKGROUND	However , population-based data to inform prevention , treatment and control are lacking .
METHODS	Using the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance , a population-based , nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and September @ on participants aged @-@ years .
METHODS	A multi-stage cluster sample design and weighting were used to produce a national representative data for that age range .
METHODS	Detailed findings on the magnitude of diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting blood glucose are presented in this paper .
RESULTS	Fasting blood glucose measurement was conducted on @ participants ( @ % females , @ % from rural areas ) .
RESULTS	The age - sex standardised population-based mean fasting blood glucose was @ mmol/L ( @ % CI @-@ @ mmol/L ) with no significant differences by age , sex and location ( urban/rural ) .
RESULTS	The overall prevalence of impaired fasting blood glucose was @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Prevalence of impaired blood glucose was higher in men than in women , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) vs @ % ( @ % CI @ % - @ % ) , p < @ .
RESULTS	In both men and women , prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose or currently on medication for diabetes was @ % ( @ % CI @ % - @ % ) .
RESULTS	Although the prevalence of diabetes was higher in men than women , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) vs @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) , in rural than urban , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) vs @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) and in males in rural than males in urban , @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) vs @ % ( @ % CI @ % -@ % ) , the differences were not statistically significant , p > @ .
RESULTS	Compared to previous estimates , prevalence of diabetes increased from < @ % in @s to @ % in @ ( this study ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High prevalence of impaired fasting blood glucose and diabetes mellitus call for the implementation of primary healthcare approaches such as the WHO package for essential non-communicable diseases to promote healthy lifestyles , early detection , treatment and control .

BACKGROUND	Malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) are a valid alternative to malaria testing with microscopy and are recommended for the testing of febrile patients before prescribing an antimalarial .
BACKGROUND	There is a need for interventions to support the uptake of RDTs by health workers .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing RDTs with basic or enhanced training in health facilities in which microscopy was available , compared with current practice .
METHODS	A three-arm cluster randomized trial was conducted in @ facilities in central and northwest Cameroon .
METHODS	Basic training had a practical session on RDTs and lectures on malaria treatment guidelines .
METHODS	Enhanced training included small-group activities designed to change health workers ' practice and reduce the consumption of antimalarials among test-negative patients .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the proportion of febrile patients correctly treated : febrile patients should be tested for malaria , artemisinin combination therapy should be prescribed for confirmed cases , and no antimalarial should be prescribed for patients who are test-negative .
METHODS	Individual patient data were obtained from facility records and an exit survey .
METHODS	Costs were estimated from a societal perspective using project reports and patient exit data .
METHODS	The analysis used bivariate multilevel modeling and adjusted for imbalance in baseline covariates .
RESULTS	Incremental cost per febrile patient correctly treated was $ @ for the basic arm and $ @ for the enhanced arm .
RESULTS	On scale-up , it was estimated that RDTs with enhanced training would save $ @ per additional febrile patient correctly treated .
CONCLUSIONS	Introducing RDTs with enhanced training was more cost-effective than RDTs with basic training when each was compared with current practice .

BACKGROUND	Functional decline and frailty are common in community dwelling older adults , increasing the risk of adverse outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Given this , we investigated the prevalence of frailty-associated risk factors and their distribution according to the severity of perceived risk in a cohort of community dwelling older adults , using the Risk Instrument for Screening in the Community ( RISC ) .
METHODS	A cohort of @ community dwelling older adults were scored for frailty by their public health nurse ( PHN ) using the Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) and for risk of three adverse outcomes : i ) institutionalisation , ii ) hospitalisation and iii ) death , within the next year , from one ( lowest ) to five ( highest ) using the RISC .
METHODS	Prior to scoring , PHNs stated whether they regarded patients as frail .
RESULTS	The median age of patients was @years ( interquartile range @ ) , of whom @ % were female and @ % were living alone .
RESULTS	The median Abbreviated Mental Test Score ( AMTS ) was @ ( @ ) and Barthel Index was @/@ ( @ ) .
RESULTS	PHNs regarded @ % of patients as frail , while the CFS categorized @ % ( scoring @ ) as frail .
RESULTS	Dividing patients into low-risk ( score one or two ) , medium-risk ( score three ) and high-risk ( score four or five ) using the RISC showed that @ % were considered high risk of institutionalization , @ % for hospitalization , and @ % for death , within one year of the assessment .
RESULTS	There were significant differences in median CFS ( @/@ versus @/@ versus @/@ , p < @ ) , Barthel Index ( @/@ versus @/@ versus @/@ , p < @ ) and mean AMTS scores ( @ versus @ versus @ , p < @ ) between those considered low , medium and high risk of institutionalisation respectively .
RESULTS	Differences were also statistically significant for hospitalisation and death .
RESULTS	Age , gender and living alone were inconsistently associated with perceived risk .
RESULTS	Frailty most closely correlated with functional impairment , r = -@ , p < @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The majority of patients in this community sample were perceived to be low risk for adverse outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Frailty , cognitive impairment and functional status were markers of perceived risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Age , gender and social isolation were not and may not be useful indicators when triaging community dwellers .
CONCLUSIONS	The RISC now requires validation against adverse outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Currently , there is limited data on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) in Indian patients .
OBJECTIVE	This post hoc study assessed the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant compared with aprepitant for prevention of CINV in the Indian population .
OBJECTIVE	A subgroup analysis was performed from data collected in a phase @ study of intravenous ( IV ) fosaprepitant or oral aprepitant , plus the @-HT @ antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone , in cisplatin-nave patients with solid malignancies .
METHODS	Patients scheduled to receive cisplatin ( @ mg/m @ ) were administered a single IV dose of fosaprepitant dimeglumine ( @ mg ) on day @ or a @-day dosing regimen of oral aprepitant ( day @:@ mg , days @ and @:@ mg ) with standard doses of ondansetron and dexamethasone .
METHODS	Patients recorded nausea and/or vomiting episodes and their use of rescue medication and were monitored for adverse events ( AEs ) and tolerability .
METHODS	Differences in response rates between fosaprepitant and aprepitant were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method .
RESULTS	In the Indian subpopulation ( n = @ ) , efficacy was similar for patients in both the fosaprepitant or aprepitant groups ; complete response in the overall , acute , and delayed phases and no vomiting in all phases were approximately @ percentage points higher in the fosaprepitant group compared with the aprepitant group .
RESULTS	Fosaprepitant was generally well-tolerated ; common AEs were similar to oral aprepitant .
CONCLUSIONS	IV fosaprepitant is as safe and effective as oral aprepitant in the Indian subpopulation and offers an alternative to the oral formulation .

OBJECTIVE	Optimizing assessments of rate of progression in Parkinson disease ( PD ) is important in designing clinical trials , especially of potential disease-modifying agents .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the value of measures of impairment , disability , and quality of life in assessing progression in early PD .
METHODS	Inception cohort analysis of data from @ patients with early , untreated PD who were enrolled in @ multicenter , randomized , double-blind clinical trials .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to @ of @ treatments ( @ received creatine , @ received minocycline , @ received coenzyme Q@ , @ received GPI-@ , and @ received placebo ) .
METHODS	We assessed the association between the rates of change in measures of impairment , disability , and quality of life and time to initiation of symptomatic treatment .
METHODS	Time between baseline assessment and need for the initiation of symptomatic pharmaceutical treatment for PD was the primary indicator of disease progression .
RESULTS	After adjusting for baseline confounding variables with regard to the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Part II score , the UPDRS Part III score , the modified Rankin Scale score , level of education , and treatment group , we assessed the rate of change for the following measurements : the UPDRS Part II score ; the UPDRS Part III score ; the Schwab and England Independence Scale score ( which measures activities of daily living ) ; the Total Functional Capacity scale ; the @-item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire , summary index , and activities of daily living subscale ; and version @ of the @-item Short Form Health Survey Physical Summary and Mental Summary .
RESULTS	Variables reaching the statistical threshold in univariate analysis were entered into a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model using time to symptomatic treatment as the dependent variable .
RESULTS	More rapid change ( ie , worsening ) in the UPDRS Part II score ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- for @ scale unit change per @ months ) , the UPDRS Part III score ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- for @ scale unit change per @ months ) , and the Schwab and England Independence Scale score ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- for @ percentage point change per @ months ) was associated with earlier need for symptomatic therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	AND RELEVANCE In early PD , the UPDRS Part II score and Part III score and the Schwab and England Independence Scale score can be used to measure disease progression , whereas the @-item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire and summary index , Total Functional Capacity scale , and the @-item Short Form Health Survey Physical Summary and Mental Summary are not sensitive to change .

BACKGROUND	To examine the effects of complex cognitive ( mahjong ) and physical ( Tai Chi ) activities on dementia severity in nursing home residents with dementia .
METHODS	Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design .
METHODS	@ residents were randomized by nursing home into three conditions : mahjong , Tai Chi , and simple handicrafts ( control ) .
METHODS	Activities were conducted three times a week for @ weeks .
METHODS	Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) was taken at @ ( baseline ) , @ ( post-treatment ) , @ , and @ months .
METHODS	The outcome measure was CDR sum-of-box , which is a composite measure of both cognitive and functional deterioration in dementia .
RESULTS	Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using multilevel regression models .
RESULTS	Apolipoprotein E @ allele and education were included as covariates .
RESULTS	Neither treatments had effects on the cognitive and functional components of the CDR , but mahjong had a significant interaction with time on the CDR sum-of-box total , suggesting a slower rate of global deterioration in the mahjong group as compared with the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	Mahjong led to a gradual improvement in global functioning and a slightly slower rate of dementia progression over time .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect was generalized and was not specific to cognition or daily functioning .

BACKGROUND	There are limited treatment options for tissue restoration and the prevention of degenerative changes in the knee .
BACKGROUND	Stem cells have been a focus of intense preclinical research into tissue regeneration but limited clinical investigation .
BACKGROUND	In a randomized , double-blind , controlled study , the safety of the intra-articular injection of human mesenchymal stem cells into the knee , the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to promote meniscus regeneration following partial meniscectomy , and the effects of mesenchymal stem cells on osteoarthritic changes in the knee were investigated .
METHODS	A total of fifty-five patients at seven institutions underwent a partial medial meniscectomy .
METHODS	A single superolateral knee injection was given within seven to ten days after the meniscectomy .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups : Group A , in which patients received an injection of @ @ allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ; Group B , @ @ allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ; and the control group , a sodium hyaluronate ( hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan ) vehicle control .
METHODS	Patients were followed to evaluate safety , meniscus regeneration , the overall condition of the knee joint , and clinical outcomes at intervals through two years .
METHODS	Evaluations included sequential magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
RESULTS	No ectopic tissue formation or clinically important safety issues were identified .
RESULTS	There was significantly increased meniscal volume ( defined a priori as a @ % threshold ) determined by quantitative MRI in @ % of patients in Group A and @ % in Group B at twelve months post meniscectomy ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No patients in the control group met the @ % threshold for increased meniscal volume .
RESULTS	Patients with osteoarthritic changes who received mesenchymal stem cells experienced a significant reduction in pain compared with those who received the control , on the basis of visual analog scale assessments .
CONCLUSIONS	There was evidence of meniscus regeneration and improvement in knee pain following treatment with allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells .
CONCLUSIONS	These results support the study of human mesenchymal stem cells for the apparent knee-tissue regeneration and protective effects .

BACKGROUND	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients have significant respiratory abnormalities with incomplete understanding of respiratory control .
BACKGROUND	This study analyzes electromyography ( EMG ) of the diaphragm ( dEMG ) using implanted diaphragm pacing ( DP ) electrodes .
METHODS	Retrospective analysis of dEMG data were obtained during Institutional Review Board and US Food and Drug Administration approved trials .
METHODS	The electrodes were used to analyze epochs of dEMG during multiple respiratory cycles .
RESULTS	Fifty-three patients were implanted .
RESULTS	Thirty-six had bilateral dEMG assessments , @ had continuous overnight readings with pulse oximetry , and @ had serial analysis .
RESULTS	Several findings revealed an alteration in the central respiratory drive including central apnea , hypoventilation , and hypercarbia .
RESULTS	The electrodes showed unilateral dysfunction and demonstrated noninvasive ventilation suppression of diaphragm activity .
RESULTS	DP can be used for serial monitoring , to decrease hypercarbia , improve sleep , and decrease atrophy .
CONCLUSIONS	Multiple abnormalities of respiratory control can be seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients using dEMG through therapeutic DP electrodes .
CONCLUSIONS	DP is used to overcome instability of respiratory control when there are intact diaphragm motor units leading to improved survival .

BACKGROUND	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among hemodialysis ( HD ) patients .
BACKGROUND	It has been attributed , among other causes , to hypertension and dyslipidemia .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a year-long consumption of Pomegranate juice ( PJ ) , on two traditional cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factors : hypertension and lipid profile , as well as on cardiovascular events .
METHODS	@ HD patients were randomized to receive @cc of PJ ( @ mM polyphenols ) or matching placebo juice , three times a week for one year .
METHODS	The primary endpoints were traditional CV risk factors ; blood pressure and lipid profile .
METHODS	Systolic , diastolic and pulse pressure , plasma levels of triglycerides ( TG ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and total cholesterol were monitored quarterly during the study year .
METHODS	Secondary endpoint was incidence of cardiovascular events .
RESULTS	PJ consumption yielded a significant time response improvement in systolic blood pressure , pulse pressure , triglycerides and HDL level ; an improvement that was not observed in the placebo intake group .
RESULTS	These beneficial outcomes were more pronounced among patients with hypertension , high level of triglycerides and low levels of HDL .
CONCLUSIONS	Regular PJ consumption by HD patients reduced systolic blood pressure and improved lipid profile .
CONCLUSIONS	These favorable changes may reduce the accelerated atherosclerosis and high incidence of CVD among HD patients .

BACKGROUND	Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease .
BACKGROUND	Computed-tomographic pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) is an accurate and safe test for diagnosing PE .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the effects on image quality ( IQ ) of electrocardiogram ( ECG ) gating during CTPA .
METHODS	Fifty consecutive patients presenting for CTPA were included in the study .
METHODS	A single acquisition was performed , resulting in two reconstructions : one at @ % of the R-R interval and the other without ECG influence .
METHODS	IQ evaluation was undertaken by two radiologists , focusing on respiratory and cardiac motion , image noise , low-contrast resolution , vessel and lung clarity , contrast media opacification and artefacts .
METHODS	Various regions of the lungs and vasculature were evaluated , and IQ scores were statistically compared .
RESULTS	For the ECG-tagged reconstructions , IQ was noted to be better overall with regard to vessel clarity ( P < @ ) and cardiac motion ( P < @ ) , while lung clarity was better only in the left lower zone ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	IQ was better with regard to image noise ( P < @ ) and low-contrast resolution ( P < @ ) in the non-ECG-tagged reconstructions .
RESULTS	No statistical IQ difference between the two types of reconstruction was noted with regard to respiratory motion , contrast media opacification or presence of artefacts .
CONCLUSIONS	The two types of reconstruction provide complementary information for evaluating CTPA results .

RESULTS	The number of patients extubated successfully on the first attempt was significantly higher in the ASV group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Weaning success and mortality at day @ were comparable between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In medical patients in the ICU , ASV may shorten the duration of weaning and total MV duration with a fewer number of manual ventilator settings .

BACKGROUND	We aim to test the hypothesis that high plasma YKL-@ is associated with short progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) treated with first-line oxaliplatin and @-flourouracil with or without cetuximab .
METHODS	A total of @ patients in the NORDIC VII Study were randomized @ to arm A ( Nordic FLOX ) , arm B ( Nordic FLOX + cetuximab ) , or arm C ( Nordic FLOX + cetuximab for @ weeks followed by cetuximab alone as maintenance therapy ) .
METHODS	Pretreatment plasma samples were available from @ patients .
METHODS	Plasma YKL-@ was determined by ELISA and dichotomized according to the age-corrected @ % YKL-@ level in @ healthy subjects .
RESULTS	Pretreatment plasma YKL-@ was elevated in @ patients ( @ % ) , and median YKL-@ was higher in patients with mCRC than in healthy subjects ( age adjusted , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with elevated YKL-@ had shorter PFS than patients with normal YKL-@ ( @ vs. @ months ; hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ P = @ ) and shorter OS ( @ vs. @ months ; HR = @ , @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that elevated pretreatment YKL-@ was an independent biomarker of short OS ( HR = @ , @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The ratio of the updated plasma YKL-@ ( i.e. level after @ , @ , @ weeks of treatment , and at end of treatment compared to the baseline level ) was associated with OS ( HR = @ , @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Plasma YKL-@ is an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with mCRC treated with first-line oxaliplatin-based therapy alone or combined with cetuximab .

OBJECTIVE	Intra-myocardial transplantation of CD@ ( + ) bone marrow stem cells ( BMC ) yielded promising results in clinical pilot trials .
OBJECTIVE	We now performed the double-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled CARDIO@ trial to determine its impact on left ventricular ( LV ) function and clinical symptoms .
RESULTS	Sixty patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and impaired LV function ( left ventricular ejection fraction , LVEF < @ % ) were randomized to undergo either coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) and injection of CD@ ( + ) BMC in the non-transmural , hypokinetic infarct border zone ( CD@ ) , or CABG and placebo injection ( placebo ) .
RESULTS	Pre-operative LVEF was @ @ % in CD@ patients and @ @ % in placebo patients .
RESULTS	Outcome was assessed after @ months , and the primary endpoint was LVEF measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) at rest .
RESULTS	The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups .
RESULTS	There was no difference in @-min walking distance , Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score , or Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) class between groups at follow-up , and New York Heart Association class improved more in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	By cardiac MRI , LVEF at @ months was @ @ % in the placebo group and @ @ % in verum patients ( P = @ ) , with an average inter-group difference of -@ % ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Systolic or diastolic LV dimensions at @ months were not different , either .
RESULTS	In the CD@ group , myocardial perfusion at rest recovered in more LV segments than in the placebo group ( @ vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Scar mass decreased by @ @ g in CD@ ( + ) patients ( P = @ ) , but was unchanged in the placebo group ( @ @ g , P = @ ; inter-group difference in change = @ g ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ) .
RESULTS	By speckle-tracking echocardiography , cell-treated patients showed a better recovery of regional wall motion when the target area was posterior .
CONCLUSIONS	Although there may be some improvements in scar size and regional perfusion , intra-myocardial injection of CD@ ( + ) BMC has no effect on global LV function and clinical symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Improvements in regional myocardial function are only detectable in patients with posterior infarction , probably because the interventricular septum after anterior infarction is not accessible by trans-epicardial injection .

BACKGROUND	Although adolescent girls are the main population for prophylactic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccines , adult women who remain at risk of cervical cancer can also be vaccinated .
BACKGROUND	We report data from the interim analysis of the ongoing VIVIANE study , the aim of which is to assess the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of the HPV @/@ AS@-adjuvanted vaccine in adult women .
METHODS	In this phase @ , multinational , double-blind , randomised controlled trial , we randomly assigned healthy women older than @ years to the HPV @/@ vaccine or control ( @:@ ) , via an internet-based system with an algorithm process that accounted for region , age stratum , baseline HPV DNA status , HPV @/@ serostatus , and cytology .
METHODS	Enrolment was age-stratified , with about @ % of participants in each of the @-@ and @-@ years age strata and @ % in the @ years and older stratum .
METHODS	Up to @ % of women in each age stratum could have a history of HPV infection or disease .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against @-month persistent infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade @ or higher ( CIN@ + ) associated with HPV @/@ .
METHODS	The primary analysis was done in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy , which consists of women who received all three vaccine or control doses , had negative or low-grade cytology at baseline , and had no history of HPV disease .
METHODS	Secondary analyses included vaccine efficacy against non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types .
METHODS	Mean follow-up time was @ months .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	The first participant was enrolled on Feb @ , @ , and the last study visit for the present analysis took place on Dec @ , @ ; @ women were included in the total vaccinated cohort ( n = @ vaccine , n = @ control ) , and @ in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy ( n = @ vaccine , n = @ control ) .
RESULTS	Vaccine efficacy against HPV @/@-related @-month persistent infection or CIN@ + was significant in all age groups combined ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ ) , in the @-@ years age group ( @ % , @-@ ) , and in the @-@ years age group ( @ % , @-@ ) ; no cases were seen in women aged @ years and older .
RESULTS	Vaccine efficacy against atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater associated with HPV @/@ was also significant .
RESULTS	We also noted significant cross-protective vaccine efficacy against @-month persistent infection with HPV @ ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ ) and HPV @ ( @ % , @-@ -RSB- ) Serious adverse events occurred in @ ( @ % ) of @ women in the vaccine group and @ ( @ % ) of @ in the control group ; five ( < @ % ) and eight ( < @ % ) of these events , respectively , were believed to be related to vaccination .
CONCLUSIONS	In women older than @ years , the HPV @/@ vaccine is efficacious against infections and cervical abnormalities associated with the vaccine types , as well as infections with the non-vaccine HPV types @ and @ .

OBJECTIVE	To describe the predictors of nurse actions in response to a mobile health decision-support system ( mHealth DSS ) for guideline-based screening and management of tobacco use .
METHODS	Observational design focused on an experimental arm of a randomized , controlled trial .
METHODS	Acute and ambulatory care settings in the New York City metropolitan area .
METHODS	@,@ patient encounters in which @ RNs enrolled in advanced practice nurse ( APN ) training were prompted by an mHealth DSS to screen for tobacco use and select guideline-based treatment recommendations .
METHODS	Data were entered and stored during nurse documentation in the mHealth DSS and subsequently stored in the study database where they were retrieved for analysis using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions .
METHODS	Predictor variables included patient gender , patient race or ethnicity , patient payer source , APN specialty , and predominant payer source in clinical site .
METHODS	Dependent variables included the number of patient encounters in which the nurse screened for tobacco use , provided smoking cessation teaching and counseling , or referred patients for smoking cessation for patients who indicated a willingness to quit .
RESULTS	Screening was more likely to occur in encounters where patients were female , African American , and received care from a nurse in the adult nurse practitioner specialty or in a clinical site in which the predominant payer source was Medicare , Medicaid , or State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
RESULTS	In encounters where the patient payer source was other , nurses were less likely to provide tobacco cessation teaching and counseling .
CONCLUSIONS	mHealth DSS has the potential to affect nurse provision of guideline-based care .
CONCLUSIONS	However , patient , nurse , and setting factors influence nurse actions in response to an mHealth DSS for tobacco cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of a reminder to screen and integration of guideline-based recommendations into the mHealth DSS may reduce racial or ethnic disparities to screening , as well as clinician barriers related to time , training , and familiarity with resources .

BACKGROUND	Although iron supplementation in malaria-free areas mostly reduces infectious morbidity , it can sometimes increase morbidity from infections as a result of the dependence of pathogenic microorganisms on iron .
BACKGROUND	Supplementation with n-@ ( -@ ) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFAs ) improved morbidity in several human studies .
BACKGROUND	However , information on the combined effect of iron and n-@ LCPUFA supplementation on infectious morbidity is limited .
OBJECTIVE	We determined whether n-@ LCPUFAs and iron supplementation , alone or in combination , affected absenteeism and illness in iron-deficient schoolchildren with low fish intake .
METHODS	A total of @ South African children ( aged @-@ y ) with iron deficiency ( ID ) were randomly divided into @ groups to receive @ ) iron plus placebo , @ ) a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid ( DHA/EPA ) plus placebo , @ ) iron plus DHA/EPA , or @ ) placebo plus placebo as oral supplements @ times/wk for @ mo. .
METHODS	Morbidity was recorded , and iron-status indexes were measured .
METHODS	The total phospholipid fatty acid composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes was analyzed in a subsample ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Iron supplementation increased the number of days with illness when all symptoms were considered ( B : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) as well as illness that was specifically caused by respiratory symptoms ( B : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) , whereas DHA/EPA reduced the number of days with illness at school ( B : -@ ; @ % CI : -@ , -@ ) .
RESULTS	The increases caused by iron were reduced to the levels seen in the placebo plus placebo group when iron was provided in combination with DHA/EPA as indicated by significant iron DHA/EPA interactions ( both P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Iron supplementation increased morbidity ( mostly respiratory ) in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren with low DHA/EPA intake , but when iron was given in combination with DHA/EPA , this effect was prevented .

OBJECTIVE	Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) is a serious disorder with high rates of morbidity and mortality .
OBJECTIVE	Family-based treatment ( FBT ) is an evidence-based therapy for adolescent AN , but less than half of those who receive this approach recover .
OBJECTIVE	Hence , it is important to identify other approaches to prevent the development of the chronic form of AN for which there is no known evidence-based treatment .
OBJECTIVE	To compare FBT with systemic family therapy ( SyFT ) for the treatment of adolescent-onset AN .
METHODS	Research in Anorexia Nervosa ( RIAN ) is a @-group ( FBT and SyFT ) randomized trial conducted between September @ and April @ .
METHODS	Interviewers were blinded to the treatment condition .
METHODS	A total of @ adolescents receiving care at @ outpatient clinics experienced in the treatment of AN were screened .
METHODS	Of these , @ adolescents did not meet the inclusion criteria and @ declined to participate ; hence , @ adolescents ( aged @-@ years ) of both sexes meeting the criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , AN ( except for amenorrhea ) were enrolled .
METHODS	Three participants were withdrawn from FBT and @ were withdrawn from SyFT after serious adverse events occurred .
METHODS	Two manualized family therapies with @ one-hour sessions during @ months .
METHODS	Family-based therapy focuses on the facilitation of weight gain , whereas SyFT addresses general family processes .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were percentage of ideal body weight ( IBW ) and remission ( @ % of IBW ) .
METHODS	The a priori hypothesis was that FBT would result in faster weight gain early in treatment and at the end of treatment ( EOT ) .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the primary outcome , for eating disorder symptoms or comorbid psychiatric disorders at the EOT or follow-up .
RESULTS	Remission rates included FBT , @ % at the EOT and @ % at follow-up and SyFT , @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Family-based therapy led to significantly faster weight gain early in treatment , significantly fewer days in the hospital , and lower treatment costs per patient in remission at the EOT ( FBT , $ @ ; SyFT , $ @ ) .
RESULTS	An exploratory moderator analysis found that SyFT led to greater weight gain than did FBT for participants with more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings of this study suggest that FBT is the preferred treatment for adolescent AN because it is not significantly different from SyFT and leads to similar outcomes at a lower cost than SyFT .
CONCLUSIONS	Adolescents with more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms may receive more benefits with SyFT .

BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of structured education in insulin-treated type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) patients .
METHODS	In a @-week open-label randomized controlled study , @ T@DM patients with inadequate responses to two or more oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) for > @ months ( HbA@c > @ % ) were randomized ( @:@ ) to either an education group ( structured diabetes education plus insulin therapy ) or a control group ( usual care plus insulin therapy ) .
METHODS	Both groups discontinued previous OADs ( except biguanides and - glucosidase inhibitors ) and started twice daily injections of @ % soluble-@ % isophane recombinant insulin .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the change in HbA@c from baseline .
METHODS	Efficacy and safety data were analyzed for within - and between-group differences .
RESULTS	Of the initial @ patients , @ completed the study ( @ in the control group ; @ in the education group ) .
RESULTS	At the end of the study , significant reductions in HbA@c versus baseline were evident in both groups , but the reduction was greater in the education group ( @ % vs. @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A higher proportion of patients in the education group achieved target HbA@c levels < @ % ( @ % vs. @ % ; P < @ ) and @ % ( @ % vs. @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , patients in the education group showed greater increments in scores and improvement in the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The overall incidence of hypoglycemic events was similar in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Structured education can promote the ability of patients to self-manage and their compliance with medications , thereby achieving better outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	The present study is a comparison of two point-of-care ( POC ) tests as endpoints of protamine titration after CPB .
OBJECTIVE	The authors hypothesized that using the heparinase-kaolin thromboelastography ( TEG-HK ) R-time difference would more readily identify residual heparin necessitating additional protamine than when using activated coagulation time ( ACT ) .
OBJECTIVE	The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in protamine dose .
OBJECTIVE	Whether this approach would lessen postoperative bleeding and sequelae also was investigated .
METHODS	Single center , blinded , prospective , randomized study .
METHODS	University teaching hospital .
METHODS	Eighty-two adult patients for on-pump coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery .
METHODS	Patients were randomized .
METHODS	In the ACT group , protamine was titrated until ACT did not exceed baseline by more than @ % .
METHODS	In the TEG group , a TEG-HK R-time difference less than @ % was targeted .
METHODS	Protamine was repeated to achieve the endpoints .
METHODS	Clinicians in the ACT group were blinded to TEG data and vice versa .
RESULTS	There was no between-group difference in total protamine dose ( @ @ and @ @ ; @ % CI of the difference between means : -@ to @ mg/kg ; p = @ ) or protamine : heparin ratios ( @:@ and @:@ ; @ % CI of the difference between means : -@ to @ mg/mg ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the ACT group , @ % of patients required a second protamine dose , and in the TEG group , @ % of patients required a second protamine dose .
RESULTS	No between-group differences in the postoperative transfusion requirements or intensive care unit length of stay were demonstrated .
CONCLUSIONS	No difference was identified in protamine dosing using either ACT or TEG-HK R-time difference as endpoints .
CONCLUSIONS	Heparinase TEG may be useful for monitoring heparin reversal .

BACKGROUND	Clinical practice guidelines are considered important instruments to improve quality of care .
BACKGROUND	However , success is dependent on adherence , which may be improved using peer assessment , a strategy in which professionals assess performance of their peers in a simulated setting .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine whether peer assessment is more effective than case-based discussions to improve knowledge and guideline-consistent clinical reasoning in the Dutch physical therapy guideline for low back pain ( LBP ) .
METHODS	A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted .
METHODS	Ten communities of practice ( CoPs ) of physical therapists were cluster randomized ( N = @ ) : @ CoPs in the peer-assessment group ( n = @ ) and @ CoPs in the case-based discussion group ( control group ) ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Both groups participated in @ educational sessions and used clinical patient cases .
METHODS	The peer-assessment group reflected on performed LBP management in different roles .
METHODS	The control group used structured discussions .
METHODS	Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at @ months .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was knowledge and guideline-consistent reasoning , measured with @ performance indicators using @ vignettes with specific guideline-related patient profiles .
METHODS	For each participant , the total score was calculated by adding up the percentage scores ( @-@ ) per vignette , divided by @ .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measure was reflective practice , as measured by the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale ( @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Vignettes were completed by @ participants ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Multilevel analysis showed an increase in guideline-consistent clinical reasoning of @ % in the peer-assessment group , whereas the control group showed a decline of @ % ( estimated group difference = @ % , @ % confidence interval = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	No group differences were found on self-reflection .
CONCLUSIONS	The small sample size , a short-term follow-up , and the use of vignettes as a proxy for behavior were limitations of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Peer assessment leads to an increase in knowledge and guideline-consistent clinical reasoning .

BACKGROUND	Eczema is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases , affecting about @ % of children .
BACKGROUND	The pathogenic mechanisms of eczema are still not fully understood , and current treatment of moderate-severe eczema is often difficult .
BACKGROUND	Recently , it has been suggested that Vitamin D plays a key role in this disease , even if mechanisms are only partially known .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of our study was to assess the @-Hydroxyvitamin D serum levels in a pediatric population suffering from chronic eczema ( IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated ) , and to correlate these phenotypes with the SCORAD severity and selected clinical and biological parameters .
OBJECTIVE	Moreover , we aimed to evaluate whether a supplementation of Vitamin D@ could affect the same clinical and laboratory parameters .
METHODS	@ children with chronic eczema were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	Severity of eczema was assessed with the SCORAD index .
METHODS	Past and present history was taken , and patients were divided into two groups according to the state of sensitization .
METHODS	According to a randomization schedule , the enrolled children were assigned to the following groups : supplementation group , which received a daily oral Vitamin D@ supplementation ( @ IUs ) for @ months ; control group which received no supplementation .
RESULTS	Vitamin D concentrations in patients with moderate and severe eczema were not statistically different from Vitamin D concentration detected in the serum of patients with mild eczema .
RESULTS	Furthermore , we did not find any correlation between Vitamin D levels , total IgEs and SCORAD index , both in the Sensitized and in the Not-Sensitized group .
RESULTS	The Vitamin D@ supplementation did not influence the SCORAD severity or the total IgEs concentration .
CONCLUSIONS	To our knowledge , our study is the first one that shows no correlation between serum levels of Vitamin D , eczema severity and IgE sensitization in a pediatric population suffering from chronic eczema .

BACKGROUND	Up to @ % of severely injured patients develop trauma-induced coagulopathy .
BACKGROUND	To study interventions for this vulnerable population for whom consent can not be obtained easily , the Food and Drug Administration issued regulations for emergency research with an exception from informed consent ( ER-EIC ) .
BACKGROUND	We describe the community consultation and public disclosure ( CC/PD ) process in preparation for an ER-EIC study , namely the Control Of Major Bleeding After Trauma ( COMBAT ) study .
METHODS	The CC/PD was guided by the four bioethical principles .
METHODS	We used a multimedia approach , including one-way communications ( newspaper ads , brochures , television , radio , and web ) and two-way communications ( interactive in-person presentations at community meetings , printed and online feedback forms ) to reach the trials catchment area ( Denver County 's population : @,@ and the Denver larger metro area where commuters reside : @ million ) .
METHODS	Particular attention was given to special-interests groups ( eg , Jehovah Witnesses , homeless ) and to Spanish-speaking communities ( brochures and presentations in Spanish ) .
METHODS	Opt-out materials were available during on-site presentations or via the COMBAT study website .
RESULTS	A total of @ community organizations were contacted .
RESULTS	Brochures were distributed to @ medical clinics and @ homeless shelters .
RESULTS	The multimedia campaign had the potential to reach an estimated audience of @ million individuals in large metro Denver area , the majority via one-way communication and @ in two-way communications .
RESULTS	This resource intensive process cost more than $ @,@ .
CONCLUSIONS	The CC/PD process is resource-intensive , costly , and complex .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the multimedia CC/PD reached a large audience , the effectiveness of this process remains elusive .
CONCLUSIONS	The templates can be helpful to similar ER-EIC studies .

BACKGROUND	Chronic angina is a profoundly symptomatic disease .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the relationship between angina frequency and health utility .
METHODS	We used data from stable angina patients reporting @ attacks/week enrolled in the Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina ( ERICA ) trial .
METHODS	Angina frequency was classified using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency ( SAQAF ) domain into no ( @ ) ; monthly ( @-@ ) ; weekly ( @-@ ) ; and daily ( @-@ ) angina .
METHODS	EuroQol ( EQ ) -@ D health utility scores were derived from SAQ data using two mapping equations .
METHODS	Median EQ-@D utility scores for each SAQAF classification after the @-week trial period were calculated ( reported as : Equation @/Equation @ ) .
METHODS	Changes in EQ-@D utility scores from baseline to end-of-trial for patients achieving and not achieving a @-point improvement in SAQAF score and improving and not improving @ SAQAF classification were compared .
RESULTS	Median EQ-@D utility scores ( n = @ ) were @ / @ .
RESULTS	Compared to patients reporting no angina symptoms ( n = @ ; @ / @ ) patients reporting monthly ( n = @ ; @ / @ ) , weekly ( n = @ ; @ / @ ) and daily ( n = @ ; @ / @ ) symptoms had poorer health utility ( p < @ for both equations ) .
RESULTS	Patients improving @SAQAF classification ( n = @/@ , @ % ) experienced a median @ / @ greater improvement in EQ-@D health utility compared to those not improving @ classification ( p < @ for both equations ) .
RESULTS	Patients improving @-points on the SAQAF ( n = @/@ , @ % ) experienced a median @ / @ greater improvement in health utility compared to those not achieving a @-point improvement ( p < @ for both ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Chronic angina patient health utility decreases as angina frequency increases .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients reporting clinically important improvement in angina frequency experience a tangible improvement in health utility .

BACKGROUND	Patients with bipolar disorder often show decreased adherence with mood stabilizers and frequently interventions on prodromal depressive and manic symptoms are delayed .
BACKGROUND	Recently , the MONARCA I randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of electronic self-monitoring using smartphones on depressive and manic symptoms .
BACKGROUND	The findings suggested that patients using the MONARCA system had more sustained depressive symptoms than patients using a smartphone for normal communicative purposes , but had fewer manic symptoms during the trial .
BACKGROUND	It is likely that the ability of these self-monitored measures to detect prodromal symptoms of depression and mania may be insufficient compared to automatically generated objective data on measures of illness activity such as phone usage , social activity , physical activity , and mobility .
BACKGROUND	The Monsenso system , for smartphones integrating subjective and objective measures of illness activity was developed and will be tested in the present trial .
METHODS	The MONARCA II trial uses a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group design .
METHODS	Patients with bipolar disorder according to ICD-@ who previously have been treated at the Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder , Denmark are included and randomized to either daily use of the Monsenso system including an feedback loop between patients and clinicians ( the intervention group ) or to the use of a smartphone for normal communicative purposes ( the control group ) for a @-month trial period .
METHODS	The trial was started in September @ and recruitment is ongoing .
METHODS	The outcomes are : differences in depressive and manic symptoms ; rate of depressive and manic episodes ( primary ) ; automatically generated objective data on measures of illness activity ; number of days hospitalized ; psychosocial functioning ( secondary ) ; perceived stress ; quality of life ; self-rated depressive symptoms ; self-rated manic symptoms ; recovery ; empowerment and adherence to medication ( tertiary ) between the intervention group and the control group during the trial .
METHODS	Ethical permission has been obtained .
METHODS	Positive , neutral and negative findings will be published .
CONCLUSIONS	If the system is effective in reducing depressive and/or manic symptoms ( and other symptoms of bipolar disorder ) and the rate of episodes , there will be basis for extending the use to the treatment of bipolar disorder in general and in larger scale .

OBJECTIVE	There are scarce data regarding the impact of sphincterotome design on cannulation success .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to compare two different @ Fr standard sphincterotomes to determine initial cannulation success .
METHODS	Adult patients with naive papillae were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , crossover study .
METHODS	Two different @ Fr sphincterotomes preloaded with guidewire ( GW ) were used in two groups with @ patients included per group .
METHODS	A total of five papillary attempts and two pancreatic channel entries were allowed as maximum targets .
METHODS	In a case of more than two pancreatic entries , a double GW technique was attempted before crossover .
METHODS	If choledochal cannulation was not achieved within ten papillary attempts or more than four pancreatic entries despite crossover , access papillotomy was performed .
METHODS	Successful biliary cannulation was the primary outcome .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were incidence of early complications and overall cannulation success .
RESULTS	Higher initial cannulation success was achieved in group I compared with group II ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The crossover and double GW techniques reduced the need for precut from @ to @ % .
RESULTS	The overall cannulation success including precut for failed cases was @ % ( group I ) and @ % ( group II ) .
RESULTS	Sphincterotome type , presence of crossover , and number of cannulation attempts were predictors of successful cannulation in multivariate analysis .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a significant difference in cannulation success between two different @ Fr sphincterotomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The cannulation success was mainly governed by sphincterotome design which serves a proper spatial orientation during the procedure .
CONCLUSIONS	The combined use of crossover and double GW techniques may substantially decrease precut necessity .

BACKGROUND	Providing written medicine information to consumers enables them to make informed decisions about their medicines , playing an important role in educating and improving health literacy .
BACKGROUND	In Australia , standardized written medicine information called Consumer Medicine Information ( CMI ) is available for medicines as package inserts , computer prints , or leaflets .
BACKGROUND	Consumers want and read CMI , but may not always ask for it .
BACKGROUND	General practitioners ( GPs ) and pharmacists are an important source of written medicine information , yet may not always provide CMI in their practice .
OBJECTIVE	To examine and compare the awareness , use and provision of CMI by consumers , pharmacists and general practitioners ( GPs ) .
METHODS	Based on previous studies , structured questionnaires were developed and administered to a national sample of consumers ( phone survey ) ; community pharmacists and GPs ( postal surveys ) about utilization of CMI .
METHODS	Descriptive , comparative and logistic regression analyses were conducted .
RESULTS	The respondents comprised of @ pharmacists , @ GPs and @ consumers .
RESULTS	Two-thirds of consumers , nearly all ( @ % ) pharmacists and @ % of GPs were aware of CMI .
RESULTS	About @ % of consumers reported receiving CMI as a package insert , however most pharmacists ( @ % ) and GPs ( @ % ) reported providing computer-generated CMI .
RESULTS	GPs ' and pharmacists ' main reason for providing CMI was on patient request .
RESULTS	Reasons for not providing were predominantly because consumers were already taking the medicine , concerns regarding difficulty understanding the information , or potential non-adherence .
RESULTS	Of the @ consumers reportedly reading CMI , @ % indicated concerns after reading .
RESULTS	Factors associated with reading included gender , type of CMI received and frequency of provision .
CONCLUSIONS	Consumers want and read information about their medicines , especially when received from their GP or pharmacist .
CONCLUSIONS	Healthcare professionals report usually discussing CMI when providing it to patients , although continued improvements in dissemination rates are desirable .
CONCLUSIONS	Regular use of CMI remains a challenge , and ongoing strategies to promote CMI use are necessary to improve uptake of CMI in Australia .

METHODS	The study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical study .
METHODS	After informed consent was obtained , @ patients ( @ men , @ women ; mean age , @ @ years ) with known chronic myocardial infarction were included for an intraindividual comparison of a single-dose gadobutrol and a single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine .
METHODS	Two MR imaging examinations were performed within a period of @ days in a crossover design .
METHODS	Late gadolinium enhancement imaging was performed @ minutes after gadolinium administration using a @-dimensional phase-sensitive inversion recovery gradient echo sequence at @ T. Infarct size , signal intensities ( SIs ) , signal-to-noise ratio , and CNR were determined on phase-sensitive MR images .
METHODS	Values for CNR were calculated as CNRinfarct/myocardium = ( SIinfarct - SImyocardium ) / SDnoise and CNRinfarct/blood = ( SIinfarct - SIblood ) / SDnoise .
METHODS	In addition , the areas of myocardial infarction were determined on single slices .
METHODS	The entire infarct volumes were calculated by adding the areas with hyperenhancement multiplied by the slice thickness .
RESULTS	Late gadolinium enhancement was present in all patients .
RESULTS	Median values of the infarct area , infarct volume , and transmurality for gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine showed good to excellent concordance ( rc = @ , rc = @ , and rc = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The mean signal-to-noise ratio values for infarct , remote myocardium , and ventricular blood were @ @ , @ @ , and @ @ , respectively , for gadobutrol and @ @ , @ @ , and @ @ , respectively , for gadobenate dimeglumine ( P = @ , P = @ , and P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The mean values of CNRinfarct/myocardium and CNRinfarct/blood were @ @ and @ @ , respectively , for gadobutrol and @ @ and @ @ , respectively , for gadobenate dimeglumine ( P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine allow for successful late gadolinium enhancement imaging of chronic myocardial infarction after a single-dose application ( @ mmol/kg ) at @ T. Gadobutrol provides a higher CNR between infarct and blood .
CONCLUSIONS	The CNRs between infarct and normal myocardium , infarct size , and transmural extent were similar for both contrast agents .

OBJECTIVE	Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery frequently experience chronic postoperative pain .
OBJECTIVE	The primary objective of this randomized study was to determine if thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB ) reduced the incidence of chronic pain after a modified radical mastectomy ( MRM ) when compared with general anesthesia ( GA ) .
METHODS	One hundred eighty women undergoing MRM were randomized to @ of @ study groups : group @ : standardized GA , group @ : GA with a single-injection TPVB and placebo paravertebral infusion , and group @ : GA with a continuous TPVB .
METHODS	Outcomes assessed postoperatively included acute postoperative pain and analgesic consumption and , at @ and @ months , the incidence and severity of chronic pain and physical and mental health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic pain at @ months ( P = @ ) and @ months ( P = @ ) after the MRM between the study groups .
RESULTS	The relative risk of developing chronic pain ( P = @ ) was also similar between the groups .
RESULTS	There was no difference in acute pain ( P = @ ) or postoperative analgesic consumption ( P = @ ) between the groups .
RESULTS	Nevertheless , differences were observed in chronic pain-related secondary outcome variables .
RESULTS	The TPVB groups reported lower chronic pain scores ( P < @ ) , exhibited fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain ( P @ ) , and also experienced better physical and mental HRQOL than did the GA group .
RESULTS	Chronic pain scores also decreased with time in all study groups ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no significant difference in the incidence or relative risk of chronic pain at @ and @ months after an MRM when TPVB is used in conjunction with GA. .
CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , patients who receive a TPVB report less severe chronic pain , exhibit fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain , and also experience better physical and mental HRQOL .

BACKGROUND	Narrative exposure therapy ( NET ) is a brief , manualised treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) .
BACKGROUND	It has been shown to have therapeutic benefits for a wide range of individuals and settings .
BACKGROUND	This study , following our previous work applying the original NET in earthquake survivors , aimed to revise NET to be adaptable for treating PTSD after a natural disaster .
METHODS	A randomised waiting-list controlled study was conducted with @ adult participants with PTSD who were randomly allocated to NET ( n = @ ) , revised NET ( NET-R ; n = @ ) or a waiting list condition ( WL ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Participants in NET and NET-R received treatment immediately ; those in the WL condition received NET-R treatment after a waiting period .
METHODS	All groups were assessed on PTSD , general distress , anxiety , depression , social support , coping and posttraumatic change before and after treatment and three-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Compared with WL , both NET and NET-R groups showed significant reductions in PTSD and related symptoms .
RESULTS	Significant increases were found in posttraumatic growth , active coping and perceived social support .
RESULTS	The WL group showed similar improvements after treatment .
RESULTS	Further reductions on PTSD symptoms were found at three months , showing that NET-R is as effective as the original NET in treating post-earthquake traumatic symptoms in adult Chinese earthquake survivors .
CONCLUSIONS	NET-R is a feasible and cost-effective intervention for Chinese earthquake survivors .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to replicate these findings in other survivor populations , and with larger samples and over longer periods .
CONCLUSIONS	This study highlighted the value of oral narrative approach , which is well-accepted and useful in the context of single natural disaster and lower - income area .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to test the diagnostic performance of low-dose computed tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) at peak tube voltage of @ kVp with both reduced radiation and reduced contrast material ( CM ) dose .
METHODS	In this single-center , single-blinded prospective randomized trial , @ patients with body weights of less than @ kg with suspected acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) were assigned to normal-dose CTPA ( @-kVp tube energy and @-mL CM , @ patients ) and low-dose CTPA ( @-kVp tube energy and @-mL CM , @ patients ) .
METHODS	Primary end points were evidence of PE in CTPA and accuracy of CTPA on a composite reference standard .
METHODS	Results were compared by calculating the odds ratio with the @ % confidence interval .
RESULTS	The reference diagnosis was equivocal in @ of the @ patients .
RESULTS	Diagnosis of CTPA was correct in @ patients and incorrect in @ in the normal-dose group .
RESULTS	Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was correct in @ patients and incorrect in @ in the low-dose group ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Sensitivity was @ % and @ % and specificity was @ % and @ % in the normal-dose and low-dose groups , respectively .
RESULTS	No PE or PE-related death occurred during the @-day follow-up .
RESULTS	The size-specific dose estimates were @ % lower at @ kVp ( @ @ mGy ) compared with that at @ kVp ( @ @ mGy ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The accuracy of low-dose CTPA at @ kVp with a @ % reduced radiation dose and a @ % lower CM volume is not significantly different from that of normal-dose CTPA at @ kVp in detecting acute PE in patients weighing less than @ kg .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the association of subretinal hyperreflective material ( SHRM ) with visual acuity ( VA ) , geographic atrophy ( GA ) , and scar in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials ( CATT ) .
METHODS	Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	The @ CATT participants .
METHODS	Masked readers graded scar and GA on fundus photography and fluorescein angiography and graded SHRM on time-domain and spectral-domain ( SD ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) throughout @ weeks .
METHODS	Measurements of SHRM height and width in the fovea , within the center @ mm ( @ ) , or outside the center @mm ( @ ) were obtained on SD OCT images at @ ( n = @ ) and @ ( n = @ ) weeks .
METHODS	Presence of SHRM , as well as location and size , and associations with VA , scar , and GA. .
RESULTS	Among CATT participants , the percentage with SHRM at enrollment was @ % , decreasing to @ % at @ weeks after treatment and to @ % at @ weeks .
RESULTS	At @ weeks , scar was present more often in eyes with persistent SHRM than in eyes with SHRM that resolved ( @ % vs. @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Among eyes with detailed evaluation of SHRM at weeks @ ( n = @ ) and @ ( n = @ ) , mean VA letter score was @ ( standard error -LSB- SE -RSB- , @ ) , @ ( SE , @ ) , @ ( SE , @ ) , and @ ( SE , @ ) when SHRM was absent , present outside the central @ mm ( @ ) , present within the central @ mm ( @ ) but not the foveal center , or present at the foveal center ( P = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	When SHRM was present , the median maximum height under the fovea , within the central @ mm ( @ ) including the fovea and anywhere within the scan , was @ m , @ m , and @ m , respectively .
RESULTS	Visual acuity was decreased with greater SHRM height and width ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , SHRM is common and often persists after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	At @ years , eyes with scar were more likely to have SHRM than other eyes .
CONCLUSIONS	Greater SHRM dimensions were associated with worse VA. .
CONCLUSIONS	In eyes with neovascular AMD , SHRM is an important morphologic biomarker .

BACKGROUND	A phase @ randomized clinical trial was designed to test whether bardoxolone methyl , a nuclear factor erythroid-@-related factor @ ( Nrf@ ) activator , slows progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with stage @ chronic kidney disease and type @ diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	The trial was terminated because of an increase in heart failure in the bardoxolone methyl group ; many of the events were clinically associated with fluid retention .
RESULTS	We randomized @,@ patients with type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) and stage @ chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( estimated glomerular filtration rate @ to < @ mL min ( -@ ) @ m ( -@ ) ) to once-daily bardoxolone methyl ( @ mg ) or placebo .
RESULTS	We used classification and regression tree analysis to identify baseline factors predictive of heart failure or fluid overload events .
RESULTS	Elevated baseline B-type natriuretic peptide and previous hospitalization for heart failure were identified as predictors of heart failure events ; bardoxolone methyl increased the risk of heart failure by @ % in patients with these risk factors .
RESULTS	For patients without these baseline characteristics , the risk for heart failure events among bardoxolone methyl - and placebo-treated patients was similar ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The same risk factors were also identified as predictors of fluid overload and appeared to be related to other serious adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Bardoxolone methyl contributed to events related to heart failure and/or fluid overload in a subpopulation of susceptible patients with an increased risk for heart failure at baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Careful selection of participants and vigilant monitoring of the study drug will be required in any future trials of bardoxolone methyl to mitigate the risk of heart failure and other serious adverse events .

OBJECTIVE	Small studies suggest that low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide may enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction ; however , neither strategy has been rigorously tested .
OBJECTIVE	To test the @ independent hypotheses that , compared with placebo , addition of low-dose dopamine ( @ g/kg/min ) or low-dose nesiritide ( @ g/kg/min without bolus ) to diuretic therapy will enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction .
METHODS	Multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation -LSB- ROSE -RSB- ) of @ hospitalized patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction ( estimated glomerular filtration rate of @-@ mL/min/@ @ m@ ) , randomized within @ hours of admission .
METHODS	Enrollment occurred from September @ to March @ across @ sites in North America .
METHODS	Participants were randomized in an open , @:@ allocation ratio to the dopamine or nesiritide strategy .
METHODS	Within each strategy , participants were randomized in a double-blind , @:@ ratio to active treatment or placebo .
METHODS	The dopamine ( n = @ ) and nesiritide ( n = @ ) groups were independently compared with the pooled placebo group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Coprimary end points included @-hour cumulative urine volume ( decongestion end point ) and the change in serum cystatin C from enrollment to @ hours ( renal function end point ) .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , low-dose dopamine had no significant effect on @-hour cumulative urine volume ( dopamine , @ mL ; @ % CI , @-@ vs placebo , @ mL ; @ % CI , @-@ ; difference , @ mL ; @ % CI , -@ to @ mL ; P = @ ) or on the change in cystatin C level ( dopamine , @ mg/L ; @ % CI , @-@ @ vs placebo , @ mg/L ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; difference , @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , low-dose nesiritide had no significant effect on @-hour cumulative urine volume ( nesiritide , @ mL ; @ % CI , @-@ vs placebo , @ mL ; @ % CI , @-@ ; difference , @ mL ; @ % CI , -@ to @ mL ; P = @ ) or on the change in cystatin C level ( nesiritide , @ mg/L ; @ % CI , @-@ @ vs placebo , @ mg/L ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; difference , -@ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , there was no effect of low-dose dopamine or nesiritide on secondary end points reflective of decongestion , renal function , or clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction , neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy .

BACKGROUND	The administration of statins seems to be a promising new avenue in the treatment of patients suffering from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , though patients suffering from severe MDD remain unstudied in this respect .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate , in a randomized double-blind clinical trial , the influence of adjuvant atorvastatin on symptoms of depression in patients with MDD .
METHODS	A total of @ patients suffering from MDD ( mean age : @ years ; @ % males ) received a standard medication of @ mg/d citalopram .
METHODS	Next , patients were randomly assigned either to the atorvastatin group ( @ mg/d ) or to the placebo group .
METHODS	Blood lipid values were assessed at baseline and on completion of the study @ weeks later .
METHODS	Experts rated depressive symptoms via Hamilton Depression Rating Scales ( HDRS ) at baseline and @ , @ and @ weeks later .
RESULTS	HDRS scores decreased over time ; the significant Time by Group interaction showed that symptoms of depression decreased more in the atorvastatin than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	Compared to the placebo group , in the atorvastatin group cholesterol , triglyceride , and Low Density Lipids ( LDL ) significantly decreased , and High Density Lipids ( HDL ) significantly increased over time .
RESULTS	HDRS scores and blood lipid values were generally not associated .
CONCLUSIONS	The pattern of results suggests that adjuvant atorvastatin favorably influences symptoms of depression among patients with severe MDD .
CONCLUSIONS	Given that after @ weeks of monotherapy and adjuvant atorvastatin patients were still moderately to severely depressed , more powerful treatment algorithms such as augmentation and change of medication are highly recommended .

OBJECTIVE	To compare measurement properties of the P@ pain scale , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain subscale ( WOMAC-pain ) , and Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain ( ICOAP ) measure in patients with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .
METHODS	A secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial included participants ( n = @ ) with knee OA that were consulting with a surgeon regarding knee arthroplasty .
METHODS	They completed pain measures ( P@ , WOMAC-pain , ICOAP ) and WOMAC-function subscale ( WOMAC-function ) at baseline and @ weeks .
METHODS	Measurement properties assessed in various subgroups included floor/ceiling effects , test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC@ ,@ ) , internal consistency using Cronbach 's , factorial structure of each pain measure combined with WOMAC-function using principal component analysis , and responsiveness using standardized response mean ( SRM ) .
RESULTS	P@ had low floor and ceiling effects ( < @ % ) .
RESULTS	P@ test-retest reliability ( ICC@ ,@ = @ ) , internal consistency ( Chronbach 's = @ ) , and responsiveness ( SRM = @ ) were similar to the values for WOMAC-pain and ICOAP .
RESULTS	Factorial structure of P@ and ICOAP were separate from WOMAC-function items .
RESULTS	WOMAC-pain and WOMAC-function items loaded on similar factors .
RESULTS	ICOAP-constant subscale had a large floor effect ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	P@ should be used to measure pain in patients with knee OA .
CONCLUSIONS	It had acceptable measurement properties which is comparable to more widely used pain measures .
CONCLUSIONS	WOMAC-pain shared a factorial structure with WOMAC-function indicating these measures might be capturing the same construct , questioning its validity to measure pain separately from function .
CONCLUSIONS	ICOAP had acceptable properties .
CONCLUSIONS	More work should compare pain measures in less severely affected OA populations .

BACKGROUND	Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk of repeated depressive relapse or recurrence .
BACKGROUND	Maintenance antidepressants for at least @ years is the current recommended treatment , but many individuals are interested in alternatives to medication .
BACKGROUND	Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) has been shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual care , but has not yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in a definitive trial .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or discontinue antidepressant treatment ( MBCT-TS ) was superior to maintenance antidepressants for prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence over @ months .
METHODS	In this single-blind , parallel , group randomised controlled trial ( PREVENT ) , we recruited adult patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of maintenance antidepressants , from primary care general practices in urban and rural settings in the UK .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or maintenance antidepressants ( in a @:@ ratio ) with a computer-generated random number sequence with stratification by centre and symptomatic status .
METHODS	Participants were aware of treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment allocation .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression , with patients followed up at five separate intervals during the @-month study period .
METHODS	The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat .
METHODS	The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials , ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Between March @ , @ , and Oct @ , @ , we assessed @ participants for eligibility and recruited @ patients from @ general practices .
RESULTS	@ patients were randomly assigned to MBCT-TS and @ to maintenance antidepressants .
RESULTS	The time to relapse or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants over @ months ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) , nor did the number of serious adverse events .
RESULTS	Five adverse events were reported , including two deaths , in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants groups .
RESULTS	No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence .
CONCLUSIONS	Both treatments were associated with enduring positive outcomes in terms of relapse or recurrence , residual depressive symptoms , and quality of life .

BACKGROUND	Acellular pertussis vaccines do not control pertussis .
BACKGROUND	A new approach to offer protection to infants is necessary .
BACKGROUND	BPZE@ , a genetically modified Bordetella pertussis strain , was developed as a live attenuated nasal pertussis vaccine by genetically eliminating or detoxifying @ toxins .
METHODS	We performed a double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating study of BPZE@ given intranasally for the first time to human volunteers , the first trial of a live attenuated bacterial vaccine specifically designed for the respiratory tract .
METHODS	@ subjects per dose group received @ , @ or @ colony-forming units as droplets with half of the dose in each nostril .
METHODS	@ controls received the diluent .
METHODS	Local and systemic safety and immune responses were assessed during @ months , and nasopharyngeal colonization with BPZE@ was determined with repeated cultures during the first @ weeks after vaccination .
RESULTS	Colonization was seen in one subject in the low dose , one in the medium dose and five in the high dose group .
RESULTS	Significant increases in immune responses against pertussis antigens were seen in all colonized subjects .
RESULTS	There was one serious adverse event not related to the vaccine .
RESULTS	Other adverse events were trivial and occurred with similar frequency in the placebo and vaccine groups .
CONCLUSIONS	BPZE@ is safe in healthy adults and able to transiently colonize the nasopharynx .
CONCLUSIONS	It induces immune responses in all colonized individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	BPZE@ can thus undergo further clinical development , including dose optimization and trials in younger age groups .

OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to evaluate the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale during radiation therapy in a cohort of women receiving treatment for breast cancer .
METHODS	The assessment of the scale was performed as a nested study within a randomised controlled trial of two creams used for radiation therapy skin care for breast cancer patients .
METHODS	The sample consisted of @ female patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer .
METHODS	Participants completed a modified version of the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale .
RESULTS	Internal consistency as measured by Cronbach 's alpha was @ , @ and @ for the Genetic Disposition , Sun Exposure and Tanning Habits subscales respectively .
RESULTS	Only the Sun Exposure subscale surpassed the @ cut-off , indicating good internal consistency .
RESULTS	Maximum likelihood factor analysis with promax rotation method confirmed the a priori factor structure for the Sun Exposure subscale as well as providing evidence of construct validity for this subscale .
RESULTS	Analysis for the other two subscales highlighted issues with internal reliability and construct validity suggesting that not all items on each subscale truly measure the intended trait .
CONCLUSIONS	The study findings support reliability and validity of the Sun Exposure subscale of the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale in a convenience sample of women receiving radiation therapy for cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite limitations with two of the three subscales , this tool continues to be used in clinical practice .

BACKGROUND	Treatment impact on quality of life ( QoL ) informs treatment management decisions in advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer ( NS NSCLC ) .
BACKGROUND	QoL outcomes from the phase III PointBreak trial are reported .
METHODS	Chemonaive patients ( n = @ ) with stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status @ to @ were randomized ( @:@ ) to pemetrexed-carboplatin-bevacizumab ( pemetrexed arm ) or paclitaxel-carboplatin-bevacizumab ( paclitaxel arm ) .
METHODS	Patients without progressive disease received maintenance pemetrexed-bevacizumab ( pemetrexed arm ) or bevacizumab ( paclitaxel arm ) .
METHODS	QoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) - General ( FACT-G ) , FACT-Lung ( FACT-L ) , and FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity ( FACT-Ntx ) instruments .
METHODS	Subscale scores , total scores , and trial outcome indices were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models .
METHODS	Post hoc analyses examined the association between baseline FACT scores and overall survival ( OS ) .
RESULTS	Mean score differences in change from baseline significantly favored the pemetrexed arm for the neurotoxicity subscale score , FACT-Ntx total scores , and FACT-Ntx trial outcome index .
RESULTS	They occurred at cycle @ ( p < @ ) and persisted through induction cycles @ to @ and six maintenance cycles .
RESULTS	Investigator-assessed , qualitative , drug-related differences in grade @ ( @ % versus @ % ) and grade @ ( @ % versus @ % ) sensory neuropathy and grade @/@ fatigue ( @ % versus @ % , p = @ ) were observed between the pemetrexed and paclitaxel arms .
RESULTS	Baseline FACT-G , FACT-L , and FACT-Ntx scores were significant prognostic factors for OS ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Randomized patients reported similar changes in QoL , except for less change from baseline in neurotoxicity on the pemetrexed arm ; investigators reported greater neurotoxicity on the paclitaxel arm and greater fatigue on the pemetrexed arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher baseline FACT scores were favorable prognostic factors for OS .

OBJECTIVE	Initiation of epidural anesthesia with long-lasting local anesthetics consumes a significant amount of time , which could be problematic in busy obstetric anesthesia suites .
OBJECTIVE	We have hypothesized that a combination of articaine and ropivacaine provides faster onset and even an early recovery of sensory-motor block characteristics .
METHODS	Sixty term parturients scheduled to have elective cesarean section were randomly allocated into three groups to receive either @ mL @ % articaine ( Group A ) , @ mL @ % articaine + @ mL @ % ropivacaine ( Group AR ) or @ mL @ % ropivacaine ( Group R ) via lumbar epidural catheter .
METHODS	The onset time of sensory block to T@ , T@ and maximum sensory block level , time to two segments regression from maximum sensory block level , onset time and duration of motor block were all recorded .
METHODS	Intraoperative and postoperative additional analgesic requirements were also recorded .
RESULTS	Demographic data were similar .
RESULTS	The onset times of sensorial block to T@ and T@ were significantly shorter in Groups A and AR in comparison with Group R ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The onset times of motor block were similar in all groups , but a more intense motor block was observed in Group R ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Two segments regression time and motor block durations were significantly shorter in Groups A and AR in comparison with Group R ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Intraoperative supplementary analgesic requirements were higher in Group A than in the other two groups ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A combination of @ % articaine and @ % ropivacaine for epidural anesthesia in a cesarean section should be preferred over epidural @ % ropivacaine alone .

BACKGROUND	Few clinical studies involving cigarettes have provided a comprehensive picture of smoke exposure , test article characterization , and insights into sensory properties combined .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of these pilot studies was to determine whether cigarettes with different levels of nicotine but similar tar levels would affect sensory experience or smoking behavior so as to significantly alter levels of selected biomarkers of exposure ( BOE ) .
METHODS	In @ confined , double-blind studies , @ adult smokers switched from Marlboro Gold cigarettes at baseline to either @ of @ lower nicotine cigarettes or @ of @ higher nicotine cigarettes and then to the other cigarette after @ days .
METHODS	Urinary excretion of exposure biomarkers ( nicotine equivalents -LSB- NE -RSB- , total and free @ - ( methylnitrosamino ) -@ - ( @-pyridyl ) -@ - butanol -LSB- NNAL -RSB- , @-hydroxypyrene , and @-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid ) as well as carboxyhemoglobin and plasma cotinine were measured at baseline , Day @ , and Day @ .
METHODS	Daily cigarette consumption was monitored and sensory characteristics were rated for each cigarette .
RESULTS	With higher nicotine yield , urine NE , urine total NNAL , and plasma cotinine increased while nonnicotine BOE decreased without changes in cigarette consumption .
RESULTS	In contrast , with lower nicotine yield , urine NE , urine total NNAL , and plasma cotinine dropped while nonnicotine BOE and cigarettes per day increased .
RESULTS	Higher nicotine cigarettes were rated harsher and stronger than at baseline while lower nicotine cigarettes were less strong .
RESULTS	All @ test cigarettes were highly disliked .
CONCLUSIONS	These studies demonstrate that abrupt increases or decreases in nicotine and the resulting sensory changes impact BOE through changes in intensity or frequency of smoking .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the measurements and growth rates of geographic atrophy ( GA ) secondary to age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) obtained using different imaging modalities .
METHODS	Thirty patients with AMD and GA measuring from @ mm to @ mm based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) fundus imaging were enrolled .
METHODS	Imaging was performed at baseline and at follow-up months @ , @ , @ , and @ , including autofluorescence ( AF ) imaging with a fundus camera-based flash system ( TRC-@DX ; Topcon Medical Systems , Oakland , NJ ; AF excitation : @-@ nm ; detection : @-@ nm ) , AF and fluorescein angiography ( FA ) imaging with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( SLO ) system ( Spectralis ; Heidelberg Engineering , Heidelberg , Germany ; AF excitation : @ nm ; detection : > @ nm ) , and SD-OCT en face imaging ( Cirrus ; Carl Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA ) .
RESULTS	Average baseline square root measurements and enlargement rates of square root areas appeared similar across all modalities ; @ mm was the largest difference between any pair of measurement means .
RESULTS	The intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC ) were essentially equal to @ for all comparisons of area measurements but were lower for growth rates than area measurements .
RESULTS	Comparison of @-week average enlargement rates showed no significant difference between the SLO AF image and enhanced SD-OCT en face image ( mean difference : @ mm ; SD : @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Agreement among all imaging modalities in measuring the areas of GA at baseline diminished when the growth rates of GA were compared over @ weeks , likely because each imaging technique identifies different anatomic features along the border of GA , which may appear similar but change at different rates .

BACKGROUND	Red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion is frequently used to treat women with acute anaemia after postpartum haemorrhage .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the economic consequences of red blood cell transfusion compared to non-intervention in these women .
METHODS	A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed alongside the Well-Being of Obstetric patients on Minimal Blood transfusions ( WOMB ) trial .
METHODS	Women with acute anaemia -LSB- Hb @-@g / dl ( @-@mm ) -RSB- after postpartum haemorrhage , without severe anaemic symptoms , were randomly allocated to RBC transfusion or non-intervention .
METHODS	Primary outcome of the trial was physical fatigue ( Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory , scale @-@ ; @ represents maximal fatigue ) .
METHODS	Total costs per arm were calculated using a hospital perspective with a @weeks time horizon .
RESULTS	Per woman , mean costs in the RBC transfusion arm ( n = @ ) were @ compared to @ in the non-intervention arm ( n = @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @ % difference in costs between study arms predominantly originated from costs of RBC units , as costs of RBC units were six times higher in the RBC transfusion arm .
RESULTS	RBC transfusion led to a small improvement in physical fatigue of @ points per day ; thus , the costs to improve the physical fatigue score with one point would be @ .
CONCLUSIONS	In women with acute anaemia after postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH ) , RBC transfusion is on average @ more expensive per woman than non-intervention , with only a small gain in HRQoL after RBC transfusion .
CONCLUSIONS	Taking both clinical and economic consequences into account , implementation of a non-intervention policy seems justified .

METHODS	Twenty-four patients undergoing elective pulmonary endarterectomy were included in the study .
METHODS	After induction of general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation , the cuff of the tracheal tube was inflated to @cmH@O .
METHODS	Following this , @ml of methylene blue dye diluted in @ml of physiological saline was injected into the hypopharynx .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to active cuff management during cooling and warming ( where cuff pressure was monitored and the cuff was reinflated if it dropped below @cmH@O , or deflated if pressure exceeded @cmH@O ) or passive monitoring ( where cuff pressure was monitored but volume was not altered ) .
METHODS	Before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass , fibreoptic bronchoscopy was performed .
METHODS	Silent aspiration was then diagnosed if blue dye was seen in the trachea below the cuff of the tube .
METHODS	The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of silent aspiration .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation of the lungs and incidence of positive culture of tracheal aspirate .
RESULTS	Active cuff management patients were younger than controls ( @ vs. @ years , P = @ ) , but otherwise the two groups were similar .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was reached because we showed that silent aspiration was significantly less frequent in the study group ( @/@ vs. @/@ patients , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly lower intracuff pressures were measured in the control group patients at several timepoints during cooling , just before hypothermic arrest and at all timepoints during rewarming .
CONCLUSIONS	We recommend that the cuff of the tracheal tube should be checked regularly during surgery under deep hypothermia , and the cuff pressure adjusted as required .

BACKGROUND	Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) .
BACKGROUND	Skin reactions are the most common side effects of cetuximab .
BACKGROUND	Rhagades of the tips of the fingers and toes , the heels and especially the interphalangeal joints are one of the most frightening and painful dermatological side effects that may develop from EGFR-inhibitor therapy .
BACKGROUND	Rhagades are characterized by pain , severe tenderness and poor healing response .
BACKGROUND	They are challenging to treat .
BACKGROUND	Thus , rhagades often poses the most significant threat to the quality of life ( QoL ) for these patients .
BACKGROUND	Ethyl-@-cyanoacrylate ( ECA ) , an ethyl ester of the @-cyano-@-propenoic acid , is often used as adhesive in a variety of different work settings in industry , i.e. as a component in nail-care products such as nail glue .
BACKGROUND	In addition , ECA is used for various medical indications , such as for liquid bandages and for suture-less surgery .
BACKGROUND	Wound healing can be accelerated with ECA .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the SUPPORT trial is to investigate the efficacy of ECA for the treatment of cetuximab-induced rhagades and to assess the clinical usefulness of the SUPO score , a new classification system for rhagades induced by EGFR-inhibitor therapy .
METHODS	The SUPPORT trial is an open-label , prospective , randomized , national multicenter intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of ECA versus the standard treatment of each institution on the pain intensity and QoL in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy .
METHODS	Primary endpoint is the assessment of the pain intensity @ hours after application of ECA or the standard treatment quantified by the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints are the evaluation of QoL assessed by the EORTC-QoL-C@ questionnaire and the Dermatological Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) .
CONCLUSIONS	During treatment with EGFR inhibitors it is necessary to recognize and manage side effects promptly to assure better patient QoL .
CONCLUSIONS	The SUPPORT trial is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating a new treatment option for painful cetuximab-induced rhagades .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , the new SUPO score will be prospectively assessed in terms of clinical usefulness for classification of EGFR inhibitor-induced rhagades .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to characterize cardiac reactivity measures , heart rate ( HR ) , and heart rate variability ( HRV ) , following acute intravenous ( IV ) alcohol administration and their association with subjective responses in social drinkers .
METHODS	Twenty-four subjects ( @ females ) received IV alcohol infusions to attain and clamp the breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) at @ mg % or placebo in separate sessions .
METHODS	Serial @-minute cardiac recordings at baseline and during the infusion were analyzed to obtain frequency and time domain cardiac measures .
METHODS	Self-reported subjective perceptions were also obtained at the same time points .
RESULTS	HR showed significant decreases from baseline , while the HRV measure pNN@ showed steady increases during the ascending phase of alcohol infusion .
RESULTS	HR was inversely correlated with pNN@ across time and treatment .
RESULTS	There was a significant association of HR with subjective feelings of high , intoxication , feeling drug effects , and liking drug effects across time during the ascending phase .
CONCLUSIONS	Acute IV alcohol resulted in decreases in HR and increases in HRV consistent with autonomic parasympathetic activation .
CONCLUSIONS	The association of these changes with subjective responses suggests that cardiac reactivity may serve as a physiological marker of subjective alcohol effects .
CONCLUSIONS	This study broadens the understanding of acute cardiovascular effects of alcohol and clinically significant cardiac conditions such as arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy associated with chronic alcohol drinking .

OBJECTIVE	A @-h phase advance model of insomnia was used to evaluate the efficacy of lorediplon , a new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic .
METHODS	Thirty-five male , healthy subjects were included in a five-way randomized cross-over study .
METHODS	During each of the periods , sleep was recorded , and residual effects were measured .
METHODS	All subjects received lorediplon @ , @ , and @ mg , placebo , and zolpidem @ mg ( i.e. , active control ) .
RESULTS	Polysomnographic evaluation revealed that lorediplon ( @ and @ mg ) significantly decreased wake after sleep onset ( WASO ) and increased total sleep time .
RESULTS	Analysis by quarters of the night showed a progressive increasing effectiveness of lorediplon @ mg across the first three quarters .
RESULTS	Lorediplon increased non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep and stage N@ sleep in the second and third quarters .
RESULTS	The magnitude of these effects was dose related , with minimal effects seen with @ mg .
RESULTS	No residual effects were observed @ h post dose .
CONCLUSIONS	Lorediplon demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in sleep , whereas zolpidem showed a more sustained WASO effect .
CONCLUSIONS	No next-day hangover effects were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	These sleep effects are also consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of lorediplon .
CONCLUSIONS	These results warrant clinical trials in patients with insomnia .

BACKGROUND	Whether adiposity indicators other than body mass index ( BMI ) should be used in studies of childhood asthma is largely unknown .
BACKGROUND	The role of atopy in `` obese asthma '' is also unclear .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the relationship among adiposity indicators , asthma , and atopy in Puerto Rican children , and to assess whether atopy mediates the obesity-asthma association .
METHODS	In a study of Puerto Rican children with ( n = @ ) and without ( n = @ ) asthma , we measured BMI , percent of body fat , waist circumference , and waist-to-hip ratio .
METHODS	The outcomes studied included asthma , lung function , measures of atopy , and , among cases , indicators of asthma severity or control .
METHODS	We performed mediation analysis to assess the contribution of atopy to the relationship between adiposity and asthma .
RESULTS	BMI , percent of body fat , and waist circumference were associated with increased odds of asthma .
RESULTS	Among cases , all @ measures were generally associated with lung function , asthma severity/control , and atopy ; however , there were differences depending on the adiposity indicator analyzed .
RESULTS	Atopy considerably mediated the adiposity-asthma association in this population : allergic rhinitis accounted for @ % to @ % of the association with asthma , and sensitization to cockroach mediated @ % to @ % of the association with forced vital capacity and @ % to @ % of the association with emergency department visits for asthma .
CONCLUSIONS	Adiposity indicators are associated with asthma , asthma severity/control , and atopy in Puerto Rican children .
CONCLUSIONS	Atopy significantly mediates the effect of adiposity on asthma outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the causal role , if any , of adiposity distribution and atopy on `` obese asthma '' in childhood .

BACKGROUND	Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin might positively affect pregnancy outcomes , but this possibility has not been adequately assessed .
BACKGROUND	Our aim was to investigate whether low-dose aspirin improved livebirth rates in women with one to two previous pregnancy losses .
METHODS	In this multicentre , block-randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , women aged @-@ years who were attempting to become pregnant were recruited from four medical centres in the USA .
METHODS	Participants were stratified by eligibility criteria -- the original stratum was restricted to women with one loss at less than @ weeks ' gestation during the previous year , whereas the expanded stratum included women with one to two previous losses , with no restrictions on gestational age or time of loss .
METHODS	Women were block-randomised by centre and eligibility stratum in a @:@ ratio .
METHODS	Preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin ( @ mg per day ) plus folic acid was compared with placebo plus folic acid for up to six menstrual cycles ; for women who conceived , study treatment continued until @ weeks ' gestation .
METHODS	Participants , trial staff , and investigators were masked to the assigned treatment .
METHODS	The primary outcome was livebirth rate , which was analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Overall , @ women were recruited and randomly assigned between June @ , @ , and July @ , @ , @ of whom completed the trial and were included in the analysis ( @ in the low-dose aspirin group and @ in the placebo group ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths , compared with @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group ( p = @ ; absolute difference in livebirth rate @ % -LSB- @ % CI -@ to @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Pregnancy loss occurred in @ ( @ % ) women in the low-dose aspirin group , compared with @ ( @ % ) women in the placebo group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the original stratum , @ ( @ % ) of @ women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths , compared with @ ( @ % ) of @ in the placebo group ( p = @ ; absolute difference in livebirth rate @ % -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	In the expanded stratum , @ ( @ % ) of @ women in the low-dose aspirin group and @ ( @ % ) of @ in the placebo group had livebirths ( p = @ ; absolute difference in livebirth rate @ % -LSB- -@ to @ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Major adverse events were similar between treatment groups .
RESULTS	Low-dose aspirin was associated with increased vaginal bleeding , but this adverse event was not associated with pregnancy loss .
CONCLUSIONS	Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with livebirth or pregnancy loss in women with one to two previous losses .
CONCLUSIONS	However , higher livebirth rates were seen in women with a single documented loss at less than @ weeks ' gestation during the previous year .
CONCLUSIONS	Low-dose aspirin is not recommended for the prevention of pregnancy loss .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate intereye corneal asymmetry in Pentacam ( Oculus Optikgerte GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany ) indices as a diagnostic method between normal patients and patients with keratoconus .
METHODS	A retrospective , observational case series of @ healthy , @ indeterminate , and @ patients with keratoconus classified by Pentacam ectasia detection indices , randomized to analysis and validation datasets .
METHODS	Intereye asymmetry in @ Scheimpflug tomography corneal descriptors was calculated and compared to develop diagnostic models .
RESULTS	Intereye asymmetry was not correlated with anisometropia in healthy controls but was correlated with the ectasia grade of the worse eye in patients with keratoconus .
RESULTS	Patients with keratoconus had significantly greater intereye asymmetry in all descriptors except for relational thickness indices .
RESULTS	Intereye asymmetry in front elevation at the thinnest corneal location afforded the single highest diagnostic performance ( @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity ) , whereas the best multivariate model combining intereye asymmetry in anterior and posterior keratometry , corneal thickness , and front and back elevation at the thinnest point provided @ % sensitivity and @ % specificity .
RESULTS	Multivariate models upheld their performance in the validation dataset .
RESULTS	Most ( more than @ % ) indeterminate patients , according to conventional Pentacam analysis , showed within-normal-range corneal asymmetry .
CONCLUSIONS	Healthy corneas are markedly symmetric irrespective of anisometropia , but corneal asymmetry analysis does not provide sufficient sensitivity to be used alone for detecting keratoconus .
CONCLUSIONS	However , its remarkable specificity suggests that it could be used combined with conventional single cornea Pentacam analysis to reduce the false-positive rate or in dubious cases .

OBJECTIVE	To determine effects of Argentine tango on motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson 's disease .
METHODS	Randomized control trial .
METHODS	Forty patients with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease .
METHODS	Movement disorder clinic and dance studio .
METHODS	Two randomized groups : group ( N = @ ) with @ partnered tango classes , and control self-directed exercise group ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was overall motor severity .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included other motor measures , balance , cognition , fatigue , apathy , depression and quality of life .
RESULTS	On the primary intention-to-treat analysis there was no difference in motor severity between groups MDS-UPDRS-@ ( @ vs@-point reduction , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patient-rated clinical global impression of change did not differ ( p = @ ) , however examiner rating improved in favor of tango ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mini-BESTest improved in the tango group compared to controls ( @ vs. -@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among individual items , tango improved in both simple TUG time ( -@ s vs. @ , p = @ ) and TUG Dual Task score ( @ vs. -@ , p = @ ) , with borderline improvement in walk with pivot turns ( @ vs. -@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	MoCa ( @ vs. -@ , p = @ ) and FSS ( -@ vs. @ , p = @ ) showed a non-significant trend toward improvement in the tango group .
RESULTS	Tango participants found the activity more enjoyable ( p < @ ) and felt more `` overall '' treatment satisfaction ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	We found no significant differences in other outcomes or adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Argentine tango can improve balance , and functional mobility , and may have modest benefits upon cognition and fatigue in Parkinson 's disease .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings must be confirmed in longer-term trials explicitly powered for cognition and fatigue .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this preliminary clinical report was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of immediate and early loaded mini-implants ( MIs ) supporting mandibular overdentures .
METHODS	Thirty-six completely edentulous patients ( @ men and @ women ) complaining of insufficient retention of their mandibular dentures were randomly assigned to two groups .
METHODS	Each patient received four MIs in the interforaminal area of the mandible using the nonsubmerged flapless surgical approach .
METHODS	In group @ ( G@ ) , MIs were loaded with mandibular overdentures using the immediate loading protocol , while in group @ ( G@ ) , MIs were loaded with overdentures using the early loading protocol .
METHODS	The cumulative survival rate was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis .
METHODS	Peri-implant health indices ( Plaque Index/Bleeding Index ) , probing depths , and marginal bone levels were recorded for both groups after MI insertions and @ , @ , @ , and @ months thereafter .
RESULTS	The cumulative implant survival rates were @ % and @ % for G@ and G@ , respectively .
RESULTS	G@ recorded significantly higher Plaque Index , Bleeding Index , and probing depths than G@ after @ months , while other observation times demonstrated no significant difference between groups .
RESULTS	Most of the recorded marginal bone loss occurred in the first year , and no significant bone loss was noted in subsequent years .
RESULTS	After @ months , marginal bone loss was significantly higher in G@ compared to G@ , but no significant differences between groups were noted thereafter .
CONCLUSIONS	Within the limitations of this study 's research design and duration of follow-up outcome analyses , immediate and early loading protocols showed good clinical results with favorable peri-implant tissue response @ years after implant insertion .
CONCLUSIONS	Early loading of MIs supporting a mandibular overdenture appears to be preferable to immediate loading .

OBJECTIVE	Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation @ Diabetes ( BARI @D ) was a study of management strategies for diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease .
OBJECTIVE	In a @ design , early revascularization versus medical management with or without late revascularization and insulin sensitization versus insulin provision were examined .
OBJECTIVE	No advantage for either strategy was seen , except in the group undergoing early coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .
OBJECTIVE	In that group , a reduction in subsequent myocardial infarction was noted .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of our report was to characterize the conduct and short-term outcomes for CABG that led to this result .
METHODS	Data from the BARI @D CABG stratum were collected , including the baseline demographic and cardiovascular characteristics , technical details of the operation , and perioperative morbidity and mortality , and analyzed .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were studied .
RESULTS	The average cardiac function was normal , and most had multivessel disease .
RESULTS	Almost all had undergone CABG by way of a median sternotomy using an internal mammary artery , and one third were off pump .
RESULTS	The perioperative morbidity and mortality were low and compared well with larger outcomes databases .
CONCLUSIONS	BARI @D showed that early CABG in patients with type @ diabetes and myocardial ischemia and multivessel disease reduced the subsequent myocardial infarction rates .
CONCLUSIONS	The present results have demonstrated that this was achieved using off-pump surgery in certain cases , standard myocardial protection , and routine use of the internal mammary artery or other arterial grafts .

BACKGROUND	Interpretive front-of-pack nutrition labels are better understood than non-interpretive labels .
BACKGROUND	However , robust evidence on the effects of such labels on consumer food purchases in the real-world is lacking .
BACKGROUND	Our aim is to assess the effects of two interpretive front-of-pack nutrition labels , compared with a non-interpretive label , on the healthiness of consumer food purchases .
METHODS	A five-week ( @-week baseline and @-week intervention ) three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial will be conducted using a bespoke smartphone application , which will administer study questionnaires and deliver intervention ( Multiple Traffic Light and Health Star Rating ) and control ( Nutrition Information Panel ) labels .
METHODS	To view their allocated nutrition label , participants scan the barcode of packaged food products using their smartphone camera .
METHODS	The assigned label is displayed instantly on the smartphone screen @ eligible participants ( New Zealand adult smartphone owners who shop in a supermarket at least once a week and are main household shoppers ) will be randomised in a @:@:@ ratio to one of the three nutrition label formats , using computer-generated randomisation sequences .
METHODS	Randomisation will be stratified by ethnicity and interest in healthy eating .
METHODS	Food and beverage purchase data will be collected continuously throughout the study via hard copy till receipts and electronic grocery purchase lists recorded and transmitted using the smartphone application .
METHODS	The primary outcome will be healthiness of food purchases in each trial arm , assessed as mean Food Standards Australia New Zealand nutrient profiling score criterion score for all food and beverages purchased over the intervention period .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will include saturated fat , sugar , sodium and energy content of food purchases ; food expenditure ; labelling profile of food purchases ( i.e. mean number of Health Star Rating stars and proportion of red , green and amber traffic lights ) ; nutrient profiling score over time and by food categories ; purchases of unpackaged foods ; self-reported nutrition knowledge and recorded use of assigned labelling system .
CONCLUSIONS	The Starlight randomised , controlled trial will determine the effects of interpretive front-of-pack nutrition labels on the healthiness of consumer food purchases in the real world .

BACKGROUND	Acid suppressant drugs are a mainstay of treatment for cats with gastrointestinal erosion and ulceration .
BACKGROUND	However , clinical studies have not been performed to compare the efficacy of commonly PO administered acid suppressants in cats .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect of PO administered famotidine , fractionated omeprazole tablet ( fOT ) , and omeprazole reformulated paste ( ORP ) on intragastric pH in cats .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that both omeprazole formulations would be superior to famotidine and placebo .
METHODS	Six healthy adult DSH colony cats .
METHODS	Utilizing a randomized , @-way crossover design , cats received @-@ @ mg/kg PO q@h fOT , ORP , famotidine , and placebo ( lactose capsules ) .
METHODS	Intragastric pH monitoring was used to continuously record intragastric pH for @ hours beginning on day @ of treatment .
METHODS	Plasma omeprazole concentrations at steady state ( day @ ) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ultraviolet detection .
METHODS	Mean percentage time that intragastric pH was @ and @ were compared among groups using ANOVA with a posthoc Tukey-Kramer test ( = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean percentage time SD that intragastric pH was @ was @ @ % for fOT , @ @ % for ORP , @ @ % for famotidine , and @ @ % for placebo .
RESULTS	Mean SD plasma omeprazole concentrations were similar in cats receiving fOT compared to those receiving ORP and in a range associated with acid suppression reported in other studies .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that both omeprazole formulations provide superior acid suppression in cats compared to famotidine or placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Fractionated enteric-coated OT is an effective acid suppressant despite disruption of the enteric coating .

BACKGROUND	Recent publications show that heat-mediated tissue tightening is a promising treatment for the lax abdomen and may provide better long-term outcomes than traditional suction-assisted liposuction ( SAL ) .
OBJECTIVE	The author evaluates the degree and duration of skin surface area contraction , as well as the influence of anatomic location of the treatment region on the degree of tissue tightening , in a study comparing SAL alone vs SAL plus radiofrequency-assisted liposuction ( RFAL ) .
METHODS	In this prospective , randomized , split abdominal study , @ consecutive patients were treated with SAL alone on @ side and with SAL plus RFAL on the other side .
METHODS	Each patient had @ ( @ @-cm ) squares-@ per treatment type-tattooed in the lower abdominal region ( @ on the right and @ on the left ) .
METHODS	The surface area of these squares was measured with the Vectra computerized measurement system ( Canfield , Inc , Fairfield , New Jersey ) at pretreatment , at @ weeks posttreatment , and at @ year posttreatment .
METHODS	All measurements were subjected to statistical analysis using predictive analytic software and were evaluated for statistical significance .
RESULTS	In regions treated with SAL alone , there was a @ % mean skin surface area contraction at @ weeks and @ % at @ year posttreatment .
RESULTS	The mean skin surface area reduction was @ % in regions treated with radiofrequency plus SAL at @ weeks and at @ year .
RESULTS	The anatomic location of each square ( medial vs lateral ) did not statistically correlate with more or less tissue tightening .
CONCLUSIONS	Radiofrequency-assisted tissue tightening , when applied in conjunction with SAL , is effective in achieving greater skin surface area reduction .

METHODS	Follow up of a randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	District general hospital in the West Midlands .
METHODS	Follow up questionnaires were sent to @ of the @ women originally recruited at the North Staffordshire Hospital to a randomised controlled study comparing forceps and vacuum extractor for assisted delivery .
METHODS	Two hundred and twenty-eight women responded ( @ % ) and all were included in the study ; forceps ( n = @ ) and vacuum extractor ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Bowel and urinary dysfunction , child vision assessment , and child development .
RESULTS	Maternal adverse symptoms at long term follow up were relatively common .
RESULTS	Urinary incontinence of various severity was reported by @ % , bowel habit urgency was reported by @ % ( @/@ ) , and loss of bowel control ` sometimes ' or ` frequently ' by @ % of women ( @/@ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences between instruments were found in terms of either bowel or urinary dysfunction .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % ( @/@ ) of children were noted to have visual problems .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in visual function between the two groups : ventouse @/@ ( @ % ) , compared with forceps @/@ ( @ % ) ; odds ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ .
RESULTS	Of the @ children with visual problems , a family history was known in @ , and @/@ ( @ % ) had a positive family history for visual problems .
RESULTS	No significant differences in child development were found between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no evidence to suggest that at five years after delivery use of the ventouse or forceps has specific maternal or child benefits or side effects .

BACKGROUND	Recently , we documented the likely non-inferiority of Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatode Artritis ( COBRA ) - light therapy ( methotrexate increased to @mg/week with initial prednisolone @mg/day ) compared with the original COBRA therapy ( methotrexate @ mg/week , sulfasalazine @g/day , with initial prednisolone @mg/day ) after @weeks in patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the non-inferiority of COBRA-light versus COBRA after @year in terms of disease activity ( DAS@ ) , functional outcome ( Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) ) and radiographic progression ( Sharp/van der Heijde score ( SHS ) ) , and to assess the effect of adding etanercept .
METHODS	An open-label , randomised controlled , non-inferiority trial of @ patients with active early RA , following a treat-to-target protocol incorporating the addition of etanercept if DAS@ @ at weeks @ or @ .
RESULTS	Both groups showed major improvements in DAS@ after @weeks : mean ( SD ) -@ ( @ ) in the COBRA and -@ ( @ ) in the COBRA-light group ( p = ns ) .
RESULTS	In both groups , functional ability improved and radiological progression of joints was minimal .
RESULTS	At least one adverse event was reported in @ % of the patients in both groups .
RESULTS	In total , @ serious adverse events occurred : @ vs @ in COBRA and COBRA-light , respectively .
RESULTS	Treatment actually instituted was often less intensive than required by the protocol : of the total population , @ patients ( @ % ) required etanercept ( more in the COBRA-light group ) , but only @ of these ( @ % ) actually received it .
CONCLUSIONS	Intensive COBRA or COBRA-light therapy has major , comparably favourable effects on disease activity , functional ability and radiological outcome after @year in patients with early RA .
CONCLUSIONS	Protocolised addition of etanercept was often not implemented by treating rheumatologists , and patients receiving it appeared to have limited added benefit , probably because of low disease activity levels at its initiation .

OBJECTIVE	This study compared time-to-hospitalization among subjects enrolled in different diabetes self-management programs ( DSMP ) .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether the interventions delayed the occurrence of any acute event necessitating hospitalization .
METHODS	Electronic medical records ( EMR ) were obtained for @ adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) of Type @ diabetes ( T@DM ) self-management programs .
METHODS	All study participants had uncontrolled diabetes and were randomized into either : personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ( CDSMP ) , combined PDA and CDSMP ( COM ) , or usual care ( UC ) groups .
METHODS	Subjects were followed for a maximum of two years .
METHODS	Time-to-hospitalization was measured as the interval between study enrollment and the occurrence of a diabetes-related hospitalization .
RESULTS	Subjects enrolled in the CDSMP-only arm had significantly prolonged time-to-hospitalization ( Hazard ratio : @ ; p = @ ) when compared to subjects in the control arm .
RESULTS	Subjects in the PDA-only and combined PDA and CDSMP arms showed no improvements in comparison to the control arm .
CONCLUSIONS	CDSMP can be effective in delaying time-to-hospitalization among patients with T@DM .
CONCLUSIONS	Reducing unnecessary healthcare utilization , particularly inpatient hospitalization is a key strategy to improving the quality of health care and lowering associated health care costs .
CONCLUSIONS	The CDSMP offers the potential to reduce time-to-hospitalization among T@DM patients .

BACKGROUND	The benefit of CT coronary angiography ( CTCA ) in patients presenting with stable chest pain has not been systematically studied .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the effect of CTCA on the diagnosis , management , and outcome of patients referred to the cardiology clinic with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease .
METHODS	In this prospective open-label , parallel-group , multicentre trial , we recruited patients aged @-@ years referred for the assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease from @ cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland .
METHODS	We randomly assigned ( @:@ ) participants to standard care plus CTCA or standard care alone .
METHODS	Randomisation was done with a web-based service to ensure allocation concealment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was certainty of the diagnosis of angina secondary to coronary heart disease at @ weeks .
METHODS	All analyses were intention to treat , and patients were analysed in the group they were allocated to , irrespective of compliance with scanning .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between Nov @ , @ , and Sept @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ ( @ % ) of @ patients who had been referred for assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease .
RESULTS	@ % of participants had a baseline clinic diagnosis of coronary heart disease and @ % had angina due to coronary heart disease .
RESULTS	At @ weeks , CTCA reclassified the diagnosis of coronary heart disease in @ ( @ % ) patients and the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease in @ ( @ % ) patients ( standard care @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Although both the certainty ( relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p < @ ) and frequency of coronary heart disease increased ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) , the certainty increased ( @ , @-@ ; p < @ ) and frequency seemed to decrease ( @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) for the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease .
RESULTS	This changed planned investigations ( @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) and treatments ( @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) but did not affect @-week symptom severity or subsequent admittances to hospital for chest pain .
RESULTS	After @ years , CTCA was associated with a @ % reduction in fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction ( @ vs @ , HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) , but this was not significant .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease , CTCA clarifies the diagnosis , enables targeting of interventions , and might reduce the future risk of myocardial infarction .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of different polymerization sequences employed during application of bis-GMAbased particulate filler composites ( PFC ) or a flowable resin ( FR ) on fiber-reinforced composite ( FRC ) .
METHODS	Unidirectional , pre-impregnated S@-glass fibers ( Dentapreg ) and multidirectional preimpregnated E-glass fibers ( Dentapreg ) ( length : @ mm ; thickness : @ mm ) were obtained ( N = @ , n = @ per group ) and embedded in translucent silicone material with the adhesion surface exposed .
METHODS	The resulting specimens were randomly divided into @ groups for the following application sequences : a ) FRC+PFC ( photopolymerized in one step ) , b ) FRC+FR ( photopolymerized in one step ) , c ) FRC+PFC ( photopolymerized individually ) , d ) FRC+FR ( photopolymerized individually ) , e ) FRC ( photopolymerized ) + intermediate adhesive resin and PFC ( photopolymerized in one step ) , f ) FRC ( photopolymerized ) + intermediate adhesive resin and FR ( photopolymerized in one step ) .
METHODS	The sequences of unidirectional ( groups a to f ) were repeated for multidirectional ( groups g to l ) FRCs .
METHODS	PFCs were debonded from the FRC surfaces using the shear bond test in a universal testing machine ( @ mm/min ) .
METHODS	On additional specimens from each FRC type , thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) was performed to characterize the fiber weight content ( Wf ) ( N = @ , n = @ per group ) .
METHODS	After debonding , all specimens were analyzed using SEM to categorize the failure modes .
METHODS	The data were statistically analyzed using @-way ANOVA and Tukey 's tests ( = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant effects of the FRC type ( S@ or E-glass ) ( p < @ ) , resin type ( PFC or FR ) ( p < @ ) and polymerization protocol ( p < @ ) were observed on the bond strength ( MPa ) .
RESULTS	Interaction terms were also significant ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The multidirectional FRC groups ( g to l ) showed significantly lower bond strengths ( @ @ to @ @ MPa ) than did the unidirectional FRC groups ( a to f ) ( @ @ to @ @ MPa ) .
RESULTS	Among the unidirectional FRC groups , the highest values were obtained with protocol f ( @ @ ) , followed by protocol e ( @ @ ) .
RESULTS	PFC adhesion to unidirectional FRC was lower when FRC and PFC were polymerized in one step ( protocol a : @ @ ) than individual polymerization ( protocol c : @ @ ) .
RESULTS	The opposite situation was true for FR ( protocol b : @ @ ; protocol d : @ @ ) .
RESULTS	Groups a to f presented exclusively mixed failures ( a combination of partial cohesive failure in the PFC and adhesive failure between the FRC and PFC ) and groups g to l demonstrated only adhesive failure ( intact FRC no cohesive failure of PFC ) .
RESULTS	TGA revealed @ @ wt % fiber content for multidirectional and @ @ wt % for unidirectional FRCs tested .
CONCLUSIONS	Multidirectional pre-impregnated E-glass fibers can not be recommended in combination with the PFC and FR materials tested in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	Application of an intermediate adhesive resin layer increases the adhesion of both PFC and FR to unidirectional FRC .
CONCLUSIONS	FRC and FR can be polymerized in one step , but FRC and PFC combinations should be polymerized individually .

BACKGROUND	Medium chain triglycerides ( MCT ) enhance thermogenesis and may reduce food intake relative to long chain triglycerides ( LCT ) .
BACKGROUND	The goal of this study was to establish the effects of MCT on appetite and food intake and determine whether differences were due to differences in hormone concentrations .
METHODS	Two randomized , crossover studies were conducted in which overweight men consumed @g of MCT or corn oil ( LCT ) at breakfast .
METHODS	Blood samples were obtained over @h .
METHODS	In Study @ ( n = @ ) , an ad lib lunch was served after @h .
METHODS	In Study @ ( n = @ ) , a preload containing @g of test oil was given at @h and lunch was served @h later .
METHODS	Linear mixed model analyses were performed to determine the effects of MCT and LCT oil on change in hormones and metabolites from fasting , adjusting for body weight .
METHODS	Correlations were computed between differences in hormones just before the test meals and differences in intakes after the two oils for Study @ only .
RESULTS	Food intake at the lunch test meal after the MCT preload ( Study @ ) was ( means.e.m . )
RESULTS	@kcal vs @kcal after LCT ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	MCT consumption resulted in a lower rise in triglycerides ( P = @ ) and glucose ( P = @ ) and a higher rise in peptide YY ( PYY , P = @ ) and leptin ( P = @ ) compared with LCT ( combined data ) .
RESULTS	Correlations between differences in hormone levels ( glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-@ ) , PYY ) and differences in food intake were in the opposite direction to expectations .
CONCLUSIONS	MCT consumption reduced food intake acutely but this does not seem to be mediated by changes in GLP-@ , PYY and insulin .

BACKGROUND	High-risk prescribing in primary care is common and causes considerable harm .
BACKGROUND	Feedback interventions have small/moderate effects on clinical practice , but few trials explicitly compare different forms of feedback .
BACKGROUND	There is growing recognition that intervention development should be theory-informed , and that comprehensive reporting of intervention design is required by potential users of trial findings .
BACKGROUND	The paper describes intervention development for the Effective Feedback to Improve Primary Care Prescribing Safety ( EFIPPS ) study , a pragmatic three-arm cluster randomised trial in @ Scottish general practices .
METHODS	The NHS chose to implement a feedback intervention to utilise a new resource , new Prescribing Information System ( newPIS ) .
METHODS	The development phase required selection of high-risk prescribing outcome measures and design of intervention components : ( @ ) educational material ( the usual care comparison ) , ( @ ) feedback of practice rates of high-risk prescribing received by both intervention arms and ( @ ) a theory-informed behaviour change component to be received by one intervention arm .
METHODS	Outcome measures , educational material and feedback design , were developed with a National Health Service Advisory Group .
METHODS	The behaviour change component was informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Health Action Process Approach .
METHODS	A focus group elicitation study and an email Delphi study with general practitioners ( GPs ) identified key attitudes and barriers of responding to the prescribing feedback .
METHODS	Behaviour change techniques were mapped to the psychological constructs , and the content was informed by the results of the elicitation and Delphi study .
RESULTS	Six high-risk prescribing measures were selected in a consensus process based on importance and feasibility .
RESULTS	Educational material and feedback design were based on current NHS Scotland practice and Advisory Group recommendations .
RESULTS	The behaviour change component was resource constrained in development , mirroring what is feasible in an NHS context .
RESULTS	Four behaviour change interventions were developed and embedded in five quarterly rounds of feedback targeting attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioural control and action planning ( @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The paper describes a process which is feasible to use in the resource-constrained environment of NHS-led intervention development and documents the intervention to make its design and implementation explicit to potential users of the trial findings .

OBJECTIVE	Rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce the incidence of postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis ( PEP ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine whether intramuscular diclofenac reduces the risk of PEP .
METHODS	Patients who underwent ERCP were randomized to receive either @mg of diclofenac or placebo by intramuscular injection immediately after the procedure .
METHODS	PEP was defined as elevated serum amylase levels ( at least three times the upper limit of normal @ hours after the procedure ) associated with new or worsened upper abdominal , epigastric , or back pain .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients were randomized , and @ were eligible for analysis .
RESULTS	The two groups were similar regarding clinical and demographic factors , as well as patient - and procedure-related risk factors for PEP .
RESULTS	PEP developed in @/@ patients ( @ % ) in the placebo group and in @/@ patients ( @ % ) in the diclofenac group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate regression analysis failed to illustrate that intramuscular diclofenac prevented PEP ( odds ratio @ ; @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic intramuscular diclofenac had no beneficial preventive effect on PEP.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Infusion of PDA-@ , a preparation of mesenchymal-like cells derived from full-term human placenta , is a new approach in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis .
OBJECTIVE	This safety study aimed to rule out the possibility of paradoxical exacerbation of disease activity by PDA-@ in patients with multiple sclerosis .
METHODS	This was a phase @b , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , @-dose ranging study including patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis .
METHODS	The study was conducted at @ sites in the United States and @ sites in Canada .
METHODS	Patients were randomized @:@ to receive @ low-dose infusions of PDA-@ ( @ ( @ ) cells ) or placebo , given @ week apart .
METHODS	After completing this cohort , subsequent patients received high-dose PDA-@ ( @ ( @ ) cells ) or placebo .
METHODS	Monthly brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed .
METHODS	The primary end point was ruling out the possibility of paradoxical worsening of MS disease activity .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of nedaplatin ( NDP ) concurrent with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal carcinoma .
METHODS	Sixty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma were randomized into either a NDP group ( n = @ ) or a cisplatin ( DDP ) group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The NDP group received NDP @-@ mg/m iv on day @ + leucovorin ( CF ) @ mg/m iv on days @-@ + @-fluorouracil ( @-FU ) @ mg/m iv on days @-@ .
METHODS	The DDP group received DDP @ mg/m iv on days @-@ + CF @ mg/m on days @-@ + @-FU @ mg/m iv on days @-@ .
METHODS	The treatment was repeated every @ wk in both groups .
METHODS	Concurrent radiotherapy -LSB- @-@ Gy / ( @-@ f ) / ( @-@ wk ) -RSB- was given during chemotherapy .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the short-term response rate between the NDP group and DDP group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Although the @ - and @-year survival rates were higher in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( @ % vs @ % , @ % vs @ % ) , the difference in the overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidences of nausea , vomiting and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ; @ % vs @ % , P = @ ; @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the incidence of myelosuppression , radiation-induced esophagitis or radiation-induced pneumonia between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	NDP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is effective and well-tolerated in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma .
CONCLUSIONS	NDP-based regimen has comparable efficacy to DDP-based regimen but is associated with lower incidences of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity .

OBJECTIVE	A growing body of studies consistently demonstrates that social responsiveness toward others is influenced by the neurohormone oxytocin .
OBJECTIVE	However , the potential role of oxytocin for self-perception remains relatively unexplored .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , we investigated whether oxytocin administration influences the self-attribution of positive and negative adjectives at the early , effortful stage of self-related information processing .
METHODS	Sixty healthy male participants received either @I .
METHODS	U. oxytocin or a placebo in a randomized double-blind study before completing a sorting task , in which they were instructed to co-classify , as fast as possible , positive and negative adjectives into either self or non-self categories .
RESULTS	Oxytocin-treated participants reported stronger positive attitudes toward themselves compared to placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	The present findings demonstrate that oxytocin administration influences the early stage of self-related information processing and suggests that the oxytocinergic system might be involved in psychopathological conditions characterized by a negative representation of self .

OBJECTIVE	Nonarteriitic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( NAION ) is a leading cause of sudden loss of vision , which particularly affects individuals older than @ years .
OBJECTIVE	Up to now there is no treatment that is effective at reversing or limiting the course of this disease .
OBJECTIVE	To study the short - and long-term effects of fluocortolone ( FC ) on the visual outcome of patients with acute NAION compared to standard treatment with pentoxifylline ( PFX ) .
METHODS	A prospective , quasirandomized intervention trial was conducted involving @ patients with acute-onset NAION .
METHODS	Patients in the comparison ( PFX ) group ( n = @ ) received PFX intravenously and per os for @ days and then per os for a further @ months , which is a standard treatment .
METHODS	Patients in the intervention ( PFX + FC ) group ( n = @ ) received the standard treatment plus @ mg/kg FC for @ days , with a subsequent stepwise dose reduction over time .
METHODS	As a primary outcome measure , the best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) was determined at the initial baseline consultation ( i.e. , before treatment ) , and at @ days and @ months after therapy onset .
METHODS	Visual field ( VF ) was analyzed using standard automated perimetry at the initial baseline examination and at @ month after therapy onset .
METHODS	Changes in BCVA and visual field in the PFX and PFX + FC groups were compared and analyzed statistically .
RESULTS	Treatment with FC resulted in a significant improvement in BCVA .
RESULTS	Patients receiving FC in acute NAION were more likely to experience improvement and less likely to have worsened visual acuity ( mean BCVA scores : at baseline , @ ; after @ days and @ months of treatment , @ and @ , respectively ) than PFX patients ( mean BCVA scores : at baseline , @ ; after @ days and @ months of treatment , @ and @ , respectively ; p < @ and @ ) .
RESULTS	The beneficial effect was even more marked @ months after therapy onset .
RESULTS	Remarkably , patients with a baseline BCVA score of > = @ profited significantly by FC treatment ( p < @ and @ ) , whereas those with a baseline BCVA score of < @ did not ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	PFX did not improve BCVA .
RESULTS	However , VF did not show any significant improvement due to FC therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first prospective randomized intervention trial that demonstrates the distinctive beneficial effects of FC in terms of the visual outcome of patients with NAION compared to standard treatment with only PFX .
CONCLUSIONS	FC significantly improves both short - and long-term visual acuity in patients with moderate BCVA impairment due to recent onset of NAION , while VF did not show any significant improvement ; however , PFX did neither enhance BCVA nor VF .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of FC should be seriously considered for the treatment of NAION whenever there are no contraindications .

OBJECTIVE	Currently , there is no consensus concerning the possible beneficial colonic and systemic effects of prebiotic-containing infant formula .
OBJECTIVE	This study assesses whether the feeding of a galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) - containing infant formula ( @ g/dl of GOS ) and the subsequent feeding of a GOS-containing follow-on formula ( @ g/dl of GOS ) have a prebiotic effect on intestinal microbiota that helps to decrease infections and allergy manifestations in healthy infants during the first year of life .
METHODS	A multicentre , randomised , double-blind and placebo-controlled trial was carried out on @ healthy term infants enrolled before @ weeks of age and randomly assigned to a formula with or without GOS , until @ months of age .
METHODS	The incidence of infections and allergy manifestations , the antibiotics prescribed and faecal characteristics were recorded up to @ months of age , while faecal samples were collected up to @ months for the measurement of secretory immunoglobulin A , short-chain fatty acids and microbiota .
RESULTS	A prebiotic effect on the faecal analysis was observed at @ months of life .
RESULTS	The GOS group showed a lower faecal pH ( P = @ ) , a lower decreasing trend in secretory immunoglobulin A ( P = @ ) , lower butyric acid concentration ( P = @ ) and an increase in Bifidobacterium counts ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Changes in faecal characteristics involved greater frequency ( P < @ ) and softer consistency ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of infections or allergic manifestations during the first year of life was similar in both groups , with no statistical differences ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The feeding of GOS-containing infant formula produced a definite prebiotic effect consisting of changes in faecal composition and microbiota , and in faecal consistency and the frequency of defaecation .
CONCLUSIONS	No changes in the incidence of infection or allergic manifestation during the first year of life were observed .

OBJECTIVE	The guided outcomes in learned efficiency ( GOLE ) model emphasizes the use of evidence-based resources to understand the diagnosis , treatment , follow-up , and prevention of disease .
OBJECTIVE	We seek to determine whether presentations created using the GOLE model are superior to an unstructured approach in achieving Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) Core Competencies .
METHODS	Consenting medical students were randomized to GOLE or control groups to individually research a self-selected clinical topic .
METHODS	A validated survey instrument was used prepresentation and postpresentation to assess perceived improvement in knowledge .
METHODS	Subjects completed self-evaluations at enrollment and after presentation of their chosen clinical topic .
METHODS	Other students , residents , and a faculty member also completed evaluations after each student presentation .
METHODS	Standard statistical methods ( analysis of variance , @-tailed t test ) were used to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between intervention and control groups .
RESULTS	Self-assessments were similar in the GOLE and control groups .
RESULTS	Externally perceived presentation scores were greater in the GOLE group ( ACGME global P < @ , presentation global P = @ ) , which demonstrated a significant improvement in @ core competencies .
RESULTS	Time spent preparing the presentation and resources utilized did not differ between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The presentations prepared using the GOLE model were rated higher by observers than those prepared using traditional techniques .

OBJECTIVE	The neighborhoods in which children live , play , and eat provide an environmental context that may influence obesity risk and ameliorate or exacerbate health disparities .
OBJECTIVE	The current study examines whether neighborhood characteristics predict obesity in a prospective cohort of girls .
METHODS	Participants were @ girls ( aged @-@ years at baseline ) , a subset from the Cohort Study of Young Girls ' Nutrition , Environment , and Transitions .
METHODS	Trained observers completed street audits within a @-mile radius around each girl 's residence .
METHODS	Four scales ( food and service retail , recreation , walkability , and physical disorder ) were created from @ observed neighborhood features .
METHODS	BMI was calculated from clinically measured height and weight .
METHODS	Obesity was defined as BMI-for-age @ % .
METHODS	Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to examine neighborhood influences on obesity risk over @ years of follow-up , controlling for race/ethnicity , pubertal status , and baseline BMI .
METHODS	Fully adjusted models also controlled for household income , parent education , and a census tract measure of neighborhood socioeconomic status .
RESULTS	A @-SD increase on the food and service retail scale was associated with a @ ( @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P < @ ) increased odds of being obese .
RESULTS	A @-SD increase in physical disorder was associated with a @ ( @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) increased odds of being obese .
RESULTS	Other neighborhood scales were not associated with risk for obesity .
CONCLUSIONS	Neighborhood food and retail environment and physical disorder around a girl 's home predict risk for obesity across the transition from late childhood to adolescence .

OBJECTIVE	Very low density lipoprotein triglyceride ( VLDL-TG ) and free fatty acids ( FFA ) constitute a substantial proportion of human energy supply both at rest and during exercise .
OBJECTIVE	Exercise acutely decreases VLDL-TG concentration , and VLDL-TG clearance is increased after an exercise bout .
OBJECTIVE	However , the effects of long-term training are not clear .
METHODS	The aim was to investigate long-term effects of training by direct assessments of VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics and oxidation in healthy lean men ( n = @ ) at rest , before and after a @-week training program , compared with a non-training control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	VLDL-TG kinetics were assessed by a primed constant infusion of -LSB- @-@C -RSB- VLDL-TG , and VLDL-TG oxidation by specific activity ( @CO@ ) in expired air .
METHODS	The metabolic study days were placed @-@h after the last exercise bout .
RESULTS	Palmitate kinetics and oxidation were assessed by a @h constant infusion of -LSB- @,@ - ( @ ) H -RSB- palmitate .
RESULTS	In the training group ( n = @ ) , maximal oxygen uptake increased significantly by @ % ( P < @ ) , and the insulin sensitivity ( assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ) improved significantly ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Despite these metabolic improvements , no changes were observed in VLDL-TG secretion , clearance , or oxidation or in palmitate kinetics .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that @ weeks of exercise training did not induce changes in VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics in healthy lean men .

BACKGROUND	Gait training for patients with hemiparesis is carried out independently overground or on a treadmill .
BACKGROUND	Several studies have shown differences in hemiparetic gait parameters during overground versus treadmill walking .
BACKGROUND	However , few studies have compared the effects of these @ gait training conditions on gait parameters , and no study has compared the short-term effects of these techniques on all biomechanical gait parameters .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether a gait training session performed overground or on a treadmill induces specific short-term effects on biomechanical gait parameters in patients with hemiparesis .
METHODS	Twenty-six subjects with hemiparesis were randomly assigned to a single session of either overground or treadmill gait training .
METHODS	The short-term effects on spatiotemporal , kinematic , and kinetic gait parameters were assessed using gait analysis before and immediately after the training and after a @-minute rest .
RESULTS	Speed , cadence , percentage of single support phase , peak knee extension , peak propulsion , and braking on the paretic side were significantly increased after the gait training session .
RESULTS	However , there were no specific changes dependent on the type of gait training performed ( overground or on a treadmill ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A gait training session performed by subjects with hemiparesis overground or on a treadmill did not induce specific short-term effects on biomechanical gait parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	The increase in gait velocity that followed a gait training session seemed to reflect specific modifications of the paretic lower limb and adaptation of the nonparetic lower limb .

OBJECTIVE	Traditional rotation-based models of placebo nausea are limited because they do not have vehicle settings and are tied to their context .
OBJECTIVE	The present study introduces a new model for examining placebo-induced nausea in the laboratory that overcomes these limitations , namely , Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation ( GVS ) .
OBJECTIVE	GVS stimulates the vestibular system to cause nausea through sensory mismatch with visual cues and importantly has a non-nauseating placebo setting .
OBJECTIVE	Using this , we tested whether conditioning could elicit placebo nausea when participants were later exposed to placebo stimulation as well as whether this placebo nausea was generalised across contexts -- something that is extremely difficult to test with rotation-based models of placebo nausea .
METHODS	Thirty healthy undergraduate students were randomised to receive either placebo GVS ( controls ) or active GVS during training ( Context-Consistent and Context-Change ) .
METHODS	On test , all groups received placebo GVS .
METHODS	The controls and Context-Consistent groups were tested in the same context as training , whereas the Context-Change group was tested in a new context .
RESULTS	Participants conditioned with nausea during training had significantly higher nausea symptom ratings after placebo stimulation on test than those given no conditioning .
RESULTS	This placebo-induced nausea also generalised to a novel test context with no differences observed between the Context-Change and Context-Consistent groups .
CONCLUSIONS	GVS provides a new model of placebo-induced nausea that overcomes limitations to traditional rotation-based paradigms .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should use this device to explore the effect of instructions and conditioning on the development of placebo nausea and to assess the efficacy of conditioning-based interventions for clinical use .

BACKGROUND	Contrasting results have been reported regarding the influence of the use of adhesive on biofilm formation .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the use of adhesive on the formation of biofilm on the internal surface of complete dentures and the palatal mucosa of denture wearers .
METHODS	Thirty participants with well-fitting complete dentures were randomly divided according to the experimental design : protocol @ , adhesive use during the first @ days , followed by no use of adhesive over the next @ days ; protocol @ , no use of adhesives during the first @ days , followed by adhesive use over the next @ days .
METHODS	After each period , material from the mucosa and intaglio of the maxillary dentures was collected .
METHODS	Replicate aliquots were plated onto Petri dishes containing selective media for Candida spp , Streptococcus mutans , and a nonselective culture medium .
METHODS	Colony-forming units were expressed as log ( CFU +@ ) / mL .
METHODS	In addition , the internal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were stained and photographed .
METHODS	From the photographs , the total internal surface and the surface stained with biofilm were quantified ( software ImageTool @ ) , and the percentage of the biofilm-covered area ( % ) on the maxillary and mandibular dentures was calculated and compared with @-way ANOVA .
METHODS	For the nonselective culture medium , data were compared with the paired-sample t test , and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the colony counts of Candida spp and Streptococcus mutans ( = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similar colony counts were found with or without the use of adhesive for the mucosa and internal surfaces of maxillary dentures , irrespective of the culture medium ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The area of dentures covered with biofilm was influenced by the use of adhesive ( P = @ ) , regardless of the type of denture ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of adhesive did not alter the colony counts of microorganisms from the palatal mucosa and maxillary dentures of complete denture wearers during the @-day period , but it did influence the area covered with biofilm on the internal surfaces of the complete dentures .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a low-volume ( @-L ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) regimen for colonoscopy compared to single ( @-L ) or split-dose ( @-L +@ - L ) regimens .
METHODS	In-hospital patients who were candidates for colonoscopy were randomly assigned to : group @ single-dose ( PEG @L the day before the study , n = @ ) ; group @ : split-dose ( @L the day before and @L on the day of the procedure , n = @ ) ; and group @ : low-volume @-L PEG solution ( the day of the procedure , n = @ ) .
METHODS	A blinded evaluation of the quality of colonic preparation was assessed by the Boston bowel preparation scale .
RESULTS	Satisfactory bowel preparation of the right colon was more frequently reported for group @ than for group @ ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , in the transverse colon it was @ % versus @ % ( P = @ ) , and on the left side of the colon it was @ % versus @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared to group @ , satisfactory bowel preparation in group @ was similar in the transverse colon and left colon .
RESULTS	Nausea , vomiting , and abdominal discomfort were less frequent in patients of group @ .
RESULTS	Patients in group @ had fewer sleep disorders and fewer hours of sleep loss compared to patients in the other groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Preparation with @L caused less abdominal discomfort and fewer sleep disorders .
CONCLUSIONS	The split dose had a better quality of preparation in the right colon .
CONCLUSIONS	Both preparations were clearly better than the @-L preparation .

BACKGROUND	Coadministration of a bacterial adjuvant with oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) has been suggested as a potential treatment for food allergy .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate a combined therapy comprising a probiotic together with peanut OIT .
METHODS	We performed a double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC @ and peanut OIT ( probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy -LSB- PPOIT -RSB- ) in children ( @-@ years ) with peanut allergy .
METHODS	The primary outcome was induction of sustained unresponsiveness @ to @ weeks after discontinuation of treatment ( referred to as possible sustained unresponsiveness ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were desensitization , peanut skin prick test , and specific IgE and specific IgG@ measurements .
RESULTS	Sixty-two children were randomized and stratified by age ( @ and > @ years ) and peanut skin test wheal size ( @ and > @ mm ) ; @ reached the trial 's end .
RESULTS	Baseline demographics were similar across groups .
RESULTS	Possible sustained unresponsiveness was achieved in @ % receiving PPOIT and @ % receiving placebo ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Nine children need to be treated for @ to achieve sustained unresponsiveness ( number needed to treat , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Of the subjects , @ % receiving PPOIT and @ % receiving placebo were desensitized ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	PPOIT was associated with reduced peanut skin prick test responses and peanut-specific IgE levels and increased peanut-specific IgG@ levels ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	PPOIT-treated participants reported a greater number of adverse events , mostly with maintenance home dosing .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the novel coadministration of a probiotic and peanut OIT and assessing sustained unresponsiveness in children with peanut allergy .
CONCLUSIONS	PPOIT was effective in inducing possible sustained unresponsiveness and immune changes that suggest modulation of the peanut-specific immune response .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is required to confirm sustained unresponsiveness after a longer period of secondary peanut elimination and to clarify the relative contributions of probiotics versus OIT .

BACKGROUND	Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is a common inflammatory skin disease with a global prevalence ranging from @ % to @ % .
BACKGROUND	Patients with AD have an increased risk for complications after viral infection ( eg , herpes simplex virus ) , and vaccination of patients with AD with live vaccinia virus is contraindicated because of a heightened risk of eczema vaccinatum , a rare but potentially lethal complication associated with smallpox vaccination .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to develop a better understanding of immunity to cutaneous viral infection in patients with AD .
METHODS	In a double-blind randomized study we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated yellow fever virus ( YFV ) vaccination of nonatopic subjects and patients with AD after standard subcutaneous inoculation or transcutaneous vaccination administered with a bifurcated needle .
METHODS	Viremia , neutralizing antibody , and antiviral T-cell responses were analyzed for up to @ days after vaccination .
RESULTS	YFV vaccination administered through either route was well tolerated .
RESULTS	Subcutaneous vaccination resulted in higher seroconversion rates than transcutaneous vaccination but elicited similar antiviral antibody levels and T-cell responses in both the nonatopic and AD groups .
RESULTS	After transcutaneous vaccination , both groups mounted similar neutralizing antibody responses , but patients with AD demonstrated lower antiviral T-cell responses by @ days after vaccination .
RESULTS	Among transcutaneously vaccinated subjects , a significant inverse correlation between baseline IgE levels and the magnitude of antiviral antibody and CD@ ( + ) T-cell responses was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	YFV vaccination of patients with AD through the transcutaneous route revealed that high baseline IgE levels provide a potential biomarker for predicting reduced virus-specific immune memory after transcutaneous infection with a live virus .

BACKGROUND	Optimal resuscitation of hypotensive trauma patients has not been defined .
BACKGROUND	This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of controlled resuscitation ( CR ) versus standard resuscitation ( SR ) in hypotensive trauma patients .
METHODS	Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting .
METHODS	Nineteen emergency medical services ( EMS ) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome Consortium participated .
METHODS	Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) of @ mm Hg or lower .
METHODS	CR patients received @ mL of fluid if they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than @ mm Hg and additional @-mL boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of @ mm Hg or greater .
METHODS	The SR group patients received @ L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain an SBP of @ mm Hg or greater .
METHODS	The crystalloid protocol was maintained until hemorrhage control or @ hours after hospital arrival .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were randomized ( @ CR and @ SR ) .
RESULTS	The CR and SR groups were similar at baseline .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) crystalloid volume administered during the study period was @ L ( @ ) in the CR group and @ L ( @ ) in the SR group , a difference of @ L ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Intensive care unit-free days , ventilator-free days , renal injury , and renal failure did not differ between the groups .
RESULTS	At @ hours after admission , there were @ deaths ( @ % ) in the CR group and @ ( @ % ) in the SR group ( adjusted odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Among patients with blunt trauma , @-hour mortality was @ % ( CR ) and @ % ( SR ) with an adjusted odds ratio of @ ( @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma ( @ % vs. @ % ; adjusted odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CR is achievable in out-of-hospital and hospital settings and may offer an early survival advantage in blunt trauma .
CONCLUSIONS	A large-scale , Phase III trial to examine its effects on survival and other clinical outcomes is warranted .
METHODS	Therapeutic study , level I.

OBJECTIVE	Early and intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment seems to be beneficial in patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke and high blood pressure .
OBJECTIVE	We wanted to see if similar benefits can be shown from a later and more gradual blood pressure lowering , using data from the Scandinavian Candesartan Acute Stroke Trial ( SCAST ) .
METHODS	SCAST was a randomized - and placebo-controlled , double-masked trial of candesartan given for @ days , in @ patients with acute stroke and systolic blood pressure @ mm Hg .
METHODS	We assessed the effects of candesartan in the @ patients with hemorrhagic stroke , using the trial 's @ coprimary effect variables : the composite vascular end point of vascular death , stroke or myocardial infarction , and functional outcome at @ months , according to the modified Rankin Scale .
METHODS	We used Cox proportional hazards models and ordinal regression for analysis and adjusted for key , predefined prognostic variables .
RESULTS	There was no association between treatment with candesartan and risk of vascular events ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- versus @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For functional outcome we found evidence of a negative effect of candesartan ( common odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence that blood pressure-lowering treatment with candesartan is beneficial during the first week of hemorrhagic stroke .
CONCLUSIONS	Instead , there were signs that such treatment may be harmful , but this needs to be verified in larger studies .

BACKGROUND	The prognostic significance of long-term visit-to-visit blood pressure variability ( BPV ) has not yet been validated in `` real world '' hypertensive patients .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the current study is to explore the prognostic value of BPV on stroke in hypertensive patients .
METHODS	This was a dynamic prospective cohort study based on electronic medical records in Shanghai , China .
METHODS	Hypertensive patients ( N = @,@ ) without history of stroke at baseline , were followed up from @ to @ .
METHODS	The cohort comprised of @ stroke patients and @,@ non-stroke patients during a mean follow-up duration of @ months .
METHODS	BPV was measured by standard deviation ( SD ) and the coefficient of variation ( CV ) of blood pressure .
RESULTS	The visit-to-visit variability of both systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) was independently associated with the occurrence of stroke -LSB- SD : the hazard ratios ( @ % confidence intervals ) of SBP and DBP were @ ( @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) ; CV : the hazard ratios ( @ % confidence intervals ) of SBP and DBP were @ ( @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) , respectively -RSB- .
RESULTS	The hazard ratio values increased along with an increase of the BPV levels of SBP and DBP .
RESULTS	The increment effect remained significant after controlling the blood pressure control status of subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased BPV of both SBP and DBP , independent of the average blood pressure , is a predictor of stroke among community hypertensive patients in real-world clinical practice .
CONCLUSIONS	The risk of stroke increased along with increased BPV .
CONCLUSIONS	Stabilizing BPV might be a therapeutic target in hypertension .

OBJECTIVE	Trichotillomania is a psychiatric condition characterized by the chronic pulling and plucking of one 's own hair .
OBJECTIVE	Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows promise as a treatment for trichotillomania and might be preferable to pharmacotherapy .
OBJECTIVE	However , there have been no randomized , controlled studies of the efficacy of group cognitive-behavioral therapy .
METHODS	We evaluated @ subjects , recruited from April @ to May @ , all of whom met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of trichotillomania .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to receive @ sessions of either group cognitive-behavioral therapy or group supportive therapy ( control ) .
METHODS	Treatment evaluation was non-blind and used self-report scales .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the improvement of hair-plucking behavior as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale .
METHODS	Secondary measures included scores on the Beck Depression Inventory , the Beck Anxiety Inventory , and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report .
RESULTS	Both groups showed significant posttreatment improvement in the scores from the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale ( F = @ , P < @ ) and the Beck Depression Inventory ( F = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The decrease in hair-plucking behavior over time was significantly greater in the study group than in the control group ( F = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the pretreatment and posttreatment time points or between the groups in the scores from the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that group cognitive-behavioral therapy is a valid treatment for trichotillomania .
CONCLUSIONS	This treatment model should be further revised and expanded to address comorbidities such as anxiety and social maladjustment .

BACKGROUND	Longitudinal data on bone mineral density ( BMD ) in children and adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) during long-term GH treatment are not available .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to determine effects of long-term GH treatment and puberty on BMD of total body ( BMDTB ) , lumbar spine ( BMDLS ) , and bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine ( BMADLS ) in children with PWS .
METHODS	This was a prospective longitudinal study of a Dutch PWS cohort .
METHODS	Seventy-seven children with PWS who remained prepubertal during GH treatment for @ years and @ children with PWS who received GH treatment for @ years participated in the study .
METHODS	The children received GH treatment , @ mg/m ( @ ) / day ( @ mg/kg/d ) .
METHODS	BMDTB , BMDLS , and BMADLS was measured by using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry machine for all annual measurements .
RESULTS	In the prepubertal group , BMDTB standard deviation score ( SDS ) and BMDLSSDS significantly increased during @ years of GH treatment whereas BMADLSSDS remained stable .
RESULTS	During adolescence , BMDTBSDS and BMADLSSDS decreased significantly , in girls from the age of @ years and in boys from the ages of @ and @ years , respectively , but all BMD parameters remained within the normal range .
RESULTS	Higher Tanner stages tended to be associated with lower BMDTBSDS ( P = @ ) and a significantly lower BMADLSSDS ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	After @ years of GH treatment , lean body mass SDS was the most powerful predictor of BMDTBSDS and BMDLSSDS in adolescents with PWS .
CONCLUSIONS	This long-term GH study demonstrates that BMDTB , BMDLS , and BMADLS remain stable in prepubertal children with PWS but decreases during adolescence , parallel to incomplete pubertal development .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on our findings , clinicians should start sex hormone therapy from the age of @ years in girls and @ years in boys unless there is a normal progression of puberty .

BACKGROUND	Obesity in youth remains a major public health issue .
BACKGROUND	Yet no effective long-term preventive strategy exists .
BACKGROUND	We previously showed that a school-based socio-ecological approach targeting behavior and social/environmental influences on physical activity ( PA ) prevented @-year excessive weight gain in @-year olds .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we investigated if this efficacy persists @ months after intervention cessation .
RESULTS	The program targeted students , family , school and the living environment to promote/support PA and prevent sedentary behavior ( SB ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ students from eight randomized middle schools completed the @-year trial .
RESULTS	At the @-month post-trial follow-up , body mass index ( BMI ) , fat mass index ( FMI ) , leisure PA ( LPA ) , home/school/workplace active commuting , TV/video time ( TVT ) , and attitudes toward PA were measured in @ adolescents .
RESULTS	The beneficial effects of the intervention on the excess BMI increase ( +@ vs +@ kgm ( -@ ) in the intervention and control groups , respectively ) and on the overweight incidence in initially non-overweight students ( @ % vs @ % ; odds ratio = @ ( @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ ) ) were maintained at the post-trial follow-up .
RESULTS	LPA was not maintained at the level achieved during the trial .
RESULTS	However , we still observed a prevention of the age-related decrease of the adolescents ' percentage reporting regular LPA ( -@ % vs -@ % ) and a higher intention to exercise in the intervention group .
RESULTS	The intervention promoted lower TVT ( -@ vs +@ min per day ) and higher active commuting changes ( +@ % vs -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Trends in higher BMI reduction in students with high initial TVT and in the least wealthy group were noted .
RESULTS	TVT changes throughout the follow-up predicted excess BMI and FMI changes .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term multilevel approach targeting PA and SB prevents excessive weight gain up to @ months after intervention cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy may be higher in the most sedentary and least wealthy adolescents .
CONCLUSIONS	Healthy PA-related behavior inducing long-lasting weight effects can be promoted in youth providing that an ecological approach is introduced in the prevention strategy .

BACKGROUND	The Checklist During Multidisciplinary Visits for Reduction of Mortality in Intensive Care Units ( Checklist - ICU ) trial is a pragmatic , two-arm , cluster-randomised trial involving @ intensive care units in Brazil , with the primary objective of determining if a multifaceted qualityimprovement intervention with a daily checklist , definition of daily care goals during multidisciplinary daily rounds and clinician prompts can reduce inhospital mortality .
OBJECTIVE	To describe our trial statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) .
METHODS	This is an ongoing trial conducted in two phases .
METHODS	In the preparatory observational phase , we collect three sets of baseline data : ICU characteristics ; patient characteristics , processes of care and outcomes ; and completed safety attitudes questionnaires ( SAQs ) .
METHODS	In the randomised phase , ICUs are assigned to the experimental or control arms and we collect patient data and repeat the SAQ .
RESULTS	Our SAP includes the prespecified model for the primary and secondary outcome analyses , which account for the cluster-randomised design and availability of baseline data .
RESULTS	We also detail the multiple mediation models that we will use to assess our secondary hypothesis ( that the effect of the intervention on inhospital mortality is mediated not only through care processes targeted by the checklist , but also through changes in safety culture ) .
RESULTS	We describe our approach to sensitivity and subgroup analyses and missing data .
CONCLUSIONS	We report our SAP before closing our study database and starting analysis .
CONCLUSIONS	We anticipate that this should prevent analysis bias and enhance the utility of results .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to investigate if therapeutic weight loss reduces P wave dispersion .
METHODS	@ obese patients ( @ males and @ females ) , part of a randomized clinical trial , were examined over a @ month period .
METHODS	They were treated with a diet , aiming at @ % weight loss at the @th month .
METHODS	After physical examination , they underwent laboratory tests , bioelectrical impedance analysis and a electrocardiogram ( ECG ) .
METHODS	ECGs were transferred to a personal computer via a scanner and then magnified @ times .
METHODS	We examined at baseline and at the @th month , maximum and minimum P-wave duration , P-wave dispersion and heart rate .
RESULTS	Comparing responders ( patients who lost @ % of weight at t@ ) and not responders ( who lost less than @ % ) , responders showed a significant reduction of P wave dispersion value ( -@ -LSB- SD : @ -RSB- mm equal to -@ -LSB- SD : @ -RSB- % p = @ ) .
RESULTS	All responders present a reduction of P wave dispersion , while for not-responders this is no longer evident .
RESULTS	Finally , a good degree of correlation ( r = @ ) between P wave dispersion difference and the decrease of weight was noticed .
RESULTS	Females have a better response in P dispersion reduction strictly connected with their weight loss with a good correlation , ( r = @ , p = @ ) , versus a moderate correlation evidenced in males ( r = @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	P wave duration and dispersion are significantly reduced in patients who lost more than @ % of weight and this decrease is highly related to the extent of weight loss .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of automated tube voltage selection on radiation dose and image quality at cardiovascular CT angiography ( CTA ) .
METHODS	We retrospectively analysed paired studies in @ patients ( @ male , @ years ) , who had undergone CTA acquisitions of the heart or aorta both before and after the implementation of an automated x-ray tube voltage selection algorithm ( ATVS ) .
METHODS	All other parameters were kept identical between the two acquisitions .
METHODS	Subjective image quality ( IQ ) was rated and objective IQ was measured by image noise , signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) and figure of merit ( FOM ) .
METHODS	Image quality parameters and effective dose were compared between acquisitions .
RESULTS	Overall subjective image quality improved with the percentage of cases scored as adequate or higher increasing from @ % to @ % after implementation of ATVS ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	SNR ( @ , @ , P = @ ) , CNR ( @ , @ , P = @ ) , and FOM ( @ , @ , P < @ ) were significantly higher after implementation of ATVS .
RESULTS	Mean image noise ( @ HU , @ HU , P = @ ) and mean effective dose ( @ mSv , @ mSv , P = @ ) were significantly lower after implementation of ATVS .
CONCLUSIONS	Automated tube voltage selection can operator-independently optimize cardiovascular CTA image acquisition parameters with improved image quality at reduced dose .
CONCLUSIONS	Automatic tube voltage selection optimizes tube voltage for each individual patient .
CONCLUSIONS	In this population , overall radiation dose decreased while image quality improved .
CONCLUSIONS	This tool may become valuable for improving dose/quality ratio .

BACKGROUND	The efficacy of psychodynamic therapy ( PDT ) for depression is debated due to a paucity of high-quality studies .
BACKGROUND	We compared short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy ( SPSP ) to cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in a randomized clinical trial .
BACKGROUND	We used therapist-rated outcomes to examine how the course of change during treatment could be best represented and to compare treatment efficacy , hypothesizing non-significant differences .
METHODS	Three hundred and forty-one adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for a depressive episode and with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) scores @ were randomized to @ sessions of individual manualized CBT or SPSP .
METHODS	Severely depressed patients ( HAM-D > @ ) received additional antidepressant medication .
METHODS	After each session , therapists rated the Clinical Global Impression Scale subscales ` Severity of Illness ' ( CGI-S ) and ` Global Improvement ' ( CGI-I ) , and the DSM-IV Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ( GAF ) .
METHODS	We fitted growth curves using mixed model analyses with intention-to-treat samples .
RESULTS	CGI-S and GAF scores during treatment were best represented by a linear symptom decrease .
RESULTS	CGI-I scores were best represented by an S-shaped curve with relative more improvement in the first and last phases than in the middle phase of treatment .
RESULTS	No significant post-treatment treatment differences were found .
RESULTS	A non-significant trend for a treatment effect on CGI-S scores vanished when controlling for therapist gender and profession .
CONCLUSIONS	Therapists were not specifically trained for CGI and GAF assessments .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings add to the evidence-base of PDT for depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Therapist characteristics and differences between severity and improvement measures might influence ratings and need to be taken into account when using therapist-rated outcome measures .

OBJECTIVE	To compare asthma control assessment using the Asthma APGAR system , a tool developed by primary care clinicians , in a multicenter primary care sample with the Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) / Childhood Asthma Control Test ( CACT ) , a tool developed by asthma specialists .
METHODS	This is a substudy of a multicenter , randomized , controlled pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of the Asthma APGAR system in primary care practices .
METHODS	As part of the study , enrolled patients completed both the ACT/CACT and the Asthma APGAR system between March @ , @ , and December @ , @ .
METHODS	Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients in our sample , @ ( @ % ) were classified as not controlled by the ACT/CACT or the Asthma APGAR system .
RESULTS	The overall agreement was @ % , with a kappa value of @ ( substantial agreement ) and a McNemar test P value of @ ( suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement ) .
RESULTS	Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system , @ % ( @ ) had no controller medications and @ % ( @ ) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma .
RESULTS	Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications , @ of @ ( @ % ) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis .
CONCLUSIONS	The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT/CACT similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care-based sample .
CONCLUSIONS	The Asthma APGAR system identified an `` actionable item '' in more than @ % ( @ ) of the individuals with poor asthma control , thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) as a method for monitoring the activity of otospongiotic lesions before and after clinical treatment .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind study .
METHODS	One single tertiary care institution in a large , cosmopolitan city .
METHODS	Twenty-six patients ( n = @ ears ) with clinical , audiometric , and tomographic diagnosis of otosclerosis were enrolled .
METHODS	If computed tomography ( CT ) demonstrated active lesions , these patients underwent MRI to detect otospongiotic foci , seen as areas of gadolinium enhancement .
METHODS	Patients were divided into @ groups and received treatment with placebo , sodium alendronate , or sodium fluoride for @ months .
METHODS	After this period , clinical and audiometric evaluations and a second MRI were performed .
METHODS	Each MRI was evaluated by both a neuroradiologist and an otolaryngologist in a subjective ( visual ) and objective ( using specific eFilm Workstation software ) manner .
RESULTS	Otospongiosis was most predominantly identified in the region anterior to the oval window , and this site was reliable for comparing pre - and posttreatment scans .
RESULTS	The patients in the alendronate and sodium fluoride groups had MRI findings that suggested a decrease in activity of otospongiotic lesions , more relevant in the alendronate group .
RESULTS	These findings were statistically significant for both subjective and objective MRI evaluations .
CONCLUSIONS	MRI shows higher sensitivity than clinical or audiometric assessment for detecting reduction in activity of otospongiosis .
CONCLUSIONS	The objective MRI evaluation based on software analysis was the most accurate method of monitoring clinical treatment response in otospongiosis .

BACKGROUND	Inflammatory bowel diseases impose on patients a broad spectrum of somatic and psychosocial burden .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that patients ' self-responsibility in planning and initiating adequate usually multimodal health care can be supported by self-assessment and proactive information , thus improving health-related quality of life and social participation .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized controlled trial among a random sample of adult members of a German statutory health insurance with Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis with at least @ inflammatory bowel diseases-related hospital stay or sick leave in @ or @ .
METHODS	Five hundred fourteen patients completed a postal screening questionnaire inquiring about @ problems .
METHODS	The intervention group ( IG ) received an automated data analysis with individualized written advice on appropriate health services , and the control group received usual care .
METHODS	Main outcomes were health-related quality of life and social participation .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included health care utilization , number of screened problems , and self-management skills .
RESULTS	After @ months , small beneficial effects were seen for all primary outcomes in the IG : EuroQol visual analog scale score ( difference between IG and control group : @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , index for measuring participation restriction ( IMET ) score ( difference between IG and control group : @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of disability days improved only in the IG .
RESULTS	The IG reported significantly fewer outpatient visits , fewer disease-related problems , and improved self-management skills ( health education impact questionnaire scores ) with no increase in disease activity , hospital stays , or consultations with allied health professionals .
CONCLUSIONS	Our activation and information procedure is effective and beneficial .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies might show its usefulness in comprehensive management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .

BACKGROUND	Relatively low radioiodine uptake ( RAIU ) represents a common obstacle for radioiodine ( ( @ ) I ) therapy in patients with multinodular goiter complicated by hyperthyroidism .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether thiamazole ( MTZ ) pretreatment can increase ( @ ) I therapeutic efficacy .
METHODS	Twenty-two patients with multinodular goiter , subclinical hyperthyroidism , and RAIU < @ % were randomized to receive either a low-iodine diet ( LID ; n = @ ) or MTZ @ mg/d ( n = @ ) for @ days .
METHODS	Thyroid function and @-hour RAIU were measured before and after treatment .
METHODS	Thyroid volume was evaluated by either magnetic resonance imaging or single photon emission computed tomography .
RESULTS	Mean @-hour RAIU increased significantly from @ @ % to @ @ % in the MTZ group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Consequently , there was a @ % decrease in the calculated median therapeutic ( @ ) I activity after MTZ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant changes in @-hour RAIU were observed after diet .
RESULTS	In the MTZ group , median serum TSH levels increased significantly by @ % and mean serum free T@ and free T@ concentrations decreased by @ % and @ % , respectively , whereas no changes in thyroid function were observed in the LID group .
RESULTS	Thyroid volume did not significantly change in either of the two groups .
RESULTS	At @ months after radioiodine treatment , median serum TSH was within the normal range in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	MTZ treatment before ( @ ) I therapy resulted in an average @-fold increase in thyroid RAIU and enhanced the efficiency of radioiodine therapy assessed at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	MTZ pretreatment is therefore a safe , easily accessible alternative to recombinant human TSH stimulation and a more effective option than LID .

BACKGROUND	Surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion ( SARPE ) is the procedure of choice for treatment of adults with transverse maxillary deficiency greater than @ mm .
BACKGROUND	There is no consensus about the dentoskeletal effect of an orthodontic retainer on the outcome of SARPE .
BACKGROUND	Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of an orthodontic retainer on dentoskeletal stability .
METHODS	Ninety digitized dental casts of @ adults undergoing SARPE were divided into @ groups-no retention ( n = @ ) and retention ( n = @ ) - and assessed .
METHODS	The dental casts were obtained at @ checkpoints : ( @ ) @ days on average before SARPE ( preoperatively ) , ( @ ) @ months after expansion , and ( @ ) @ months after expansion was completed .
METHODS	The retention patients received a transpalatal arch just after expander removal , at checkpoint @ .
METHODS	The transpalatal arch was kept for @ months after completion of the expansion ( checkpoint @ and end of the study ) .
METHODS	The dental casts were scanned with a Vivid @i @D laser scanner ( Konica Minolta , Wayne , NJ ) .
METHODS	The distances measured were premolar and molar intercusp distances , premolar and molar intercervical distances , premolar and molar inter-WALA ( Will Andrews and Lawrence Andrews ) ridge distances , and palate height at the maxillary first molar .
RESULTS	The planned maxillary expansion was within the expected amount ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Palatal height at the @-month checkpoint decreased by @ mm ( @ % ) ( P < @ ) and again at the @-month checkpoint by @ mm ( @ % ) ( P > @ ) but not significantly in both groups .
RESULTS	The premolar intercusp distance had a relapse at checkpoint @ of @ mm ( @ % ) ( P < @ ) in the no-retention group .
RESULTS	Both groups had average relapses of @ mm in the premolar intercervical distances , of @ mm in the premolar inter-WALA ridge distances , of @ mm in the molar intercusp distances , of @ mm in the molar intercervical distances , and of @ mm in the molar inter-WALA ridge distances ( P < @ ) at checkpoint @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The analysis of relapse in both groups suggests that the use of a transpalatal arch as a retaining device does not improve dento-osseous stability .

BACKGROUND	Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	Existing data on cardiac structure and function in HFpEF suggest significant heterogeneity in this population .
RESULTS	Echocardiograms were obtained from @ patients with HFpEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction @ % ) enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist ( TOPCAT ) trial before initiation of randomized therapy .
RESULTS	Average age was @ years , @ % were women , @ % were of African descent , and comorbidities were highly prevalent .
RESULTS	Centralized quantitative analysis in a blinded core laboratory demonstrated a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of @ % , with prevalent concentric left ventricular remodeling ( @ % ) and hypertrophy ( @ % ) , and left atrial enlargement ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Diastolic dysfunction was present in @ % of gradable participants and was significantly associated with greater left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher prevalence of left atrial enlargement .
RESULTS	Doppler evidence of pulmonary hypertension was present in @ % .
RESULTS	At least @ measure of structural heart disease was present in @ % of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients enrolled in TOPCAT demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of ventricular remodeling , with high prevalence of structural heart disease , including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement , in addition to pulmonary hypertension , each of which has been associated with adverse outcomes in HFpEF .
CONCLUSIONS	Diastolic function was normal in approximately one third of gradable participants , highlighting the heterogeneity of the cardiac phenotype in this syndrome .

###24286966
OBJECTIVE	This study examined the relationships between treatment fidelity and treatment outcomes in a community-based trial of a @-Step Facilitation ( TSF ) intervention .
METHODS	In a prior multi-site randomized clinical trial , @ participants in @ outpatient drug treatment clinics were assigned to receive the Stimulant Abuser Groups to Engage in @-Step ( STAGE-@ ) intervention .
METHODS	A secondary analysis reviewed and coded all STAGE-@ sessions for fidelity to the protocol , using the Twelve Step Facilitation Adherence Competence Empathy Scale ( TSF ACES ) .
METHODS	Linear mixed-effects models tested the relationship between three fidelity measures ( adherence , competence , empathy ) and six treatment outcomes ( number of days of drug use and five Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) composite scores ) measured at @ months post-baseline .
RESULTS	Adherence , competence and empathy were robustly associated with improved employment status at follow up .
RESULTS	Empathy was inversely associated with drug use , as was competence in a non-significant trend ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Testing individual ASI drug composite score items suggested that greater competence was associated with fewer days of drug use and , at the same time , with an increased sense of being troubled or bothered by drug use .
CONCLUSIONS	Greater competence and empathy in the delivery of a TSF intervention were associated with better drug use and employment outcomes , while adherence was associated with employment outcomes only .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher therapist competence was associated with lower self-report drug use , and also associated with greater self-report concern about drug use .
CONCLUSIONS	The nature of TSF intervention may promote high levels of concern about drug use even when actual use is low .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effectiveness of two low-intensity approaches for distressed patients with cancer and caregivers who had called cancer helplines seeking support .
OBJECTIVE	Baseline distress was hypothesized as a moderator of intervention effect .
METHODS	Randomized trial .
METHODS	Community-based cancer helplines in Queensland and New South Wales , Australia .
METHODS	@ patients with cancer and @ caregivers .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to either a single session of nurse-led self-management intervention or a five-session psychologist cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by telephone .
METHODS	Assessments were undertaken at baseline ( preintervention ) and at @ , @ , and @ months .
METHODS	Psychological and cancer-specific distress and post-traumatic growth .
RESULTS	No significant moderation by baseline cancer-specific distress was noted .
RESULTS	For low-education patients , only the psychologist intervention was associated with a significant drop in distress .
RESULTS	For all other participants , distress decreased over time in both arms with small to large effect sizes ( Cohen 's ds = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Post-traumatic growth increased over time for all participants ( Cohen 's ds = @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Many distressed patients with cancer and their caregivers may benefit significantly from a single session of a nurse psychoeducation intervention that can be delivered remotely by telephone and supported by self-management materials .
CONCLUSIONS	Research is needed to develop an algorithm that moves beyond the use of distress as the only indicator for referral to specialist psychological services .
CONCLUSIONS	Survivors and caregivers with low education and low literacy may require more in-depth and targeted support .

METHODS	Randomized , double-blind , parallel-group trial conducted between January @ and August @ , in @ ambulatory or hospital sites in Germany , Austria , or Switzerland .
METHODS	Eligible participants were aged @ , had new-onset epilepsy , had no acute illness as the cause of their seizures , and had no contraindication to the drugs in the trial .
METHODS	Patients were randomized @:@:@ to CR-CBZ , LTG , or LEV .
METHODS	Doses were up-titrated for @ weeks and could be maintained or adjusted depending on seizure relapse or tolerability over an additional period of @ weeks .
METHODS	Primary outcome was the retention to treatment at week @ ; secondary measures related to seizure and adverse event frequency .
RESULTS	Of @ randomized patients , @ were included ( CR-CBZ n = @ , LTG n = @ , LEV n = @ ) in the modified intent-to-treat population ( mean age -LSB- range -RSB- @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- years ) .
RESULTS	At week @ , the retention rate for LEV was significantly higher than for CR-CBZ ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) , and similar to LTG ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Seizure freedom rates at weeks @ and @ were not different across the groups .
RESULTS	Twice as many patients receiving CR-CBZ discontinued due to adverse events or death compared to those in the LEV group ( @ % vs. @ % ; odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ , p = @ ) , whereas discontinuation was intermediate for LTG ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Median daily doses of completers ( n = @ ) were CR-CBZ @ mg/day ( @-@ @ ) , LTG @ mg/day ( @-@ @ ) , and LEV @ mg/day ( @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In the initial monotherapy of focal epilepsy in the elderly , @-year retention to LEV was higher compared to CR-CBZ due to better tolerability .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether an evidence-based pediatric outpatient intervention for parents who smoke persisted after initial implementation .
METHODS	A cluster randomized controlled trial of @ pediatric practices in @ states that received either Clinical and Community Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure ( CEASE ) intervention or usual care .
METHODS	The intervention provided practices with training to provide evidence-based assistance to parents who smoke .
METHODS	The primary outcome , assessed by the @-month follow-up telephone survey with parents , was provision of meaningful tobacco control assistance , defined as discussing various strategies to quit smoking , discussing smoking cessation medication , or recommending the use of the state quitline after initial enrollment visit .
METHODS	We also assessed parental quit rates at @ months , determined by self-report and biochemical verification .
RESULTS	Practices ' rates of providing any meaningful tobacco control assistance ( @ % vs @ % ) , discussing various strategies to quit smoking ( @ % vs @ % ) , discussing cessation medication ( @ % vs @ % ) , and recommending the use of the quitline ( @ % vs @ % ) were all significantly higher in the intervention than in the control groups , respectively ( P < @ for each ) , during the @-month postintervention implementation .
RESULTS	Receiving any assistance was associated with a cotinine-confirmed quitting adjusted odds ratio of @ ( @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	After controlling for demographic and behavioral factors , the adjusted odds ratio for cotinine-confirmed quitting in intervention versus control practices was @ ( @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intervention practices had higher rates of delivering tobacco control assistance than usual care practices over the @-year follow-up period .
CONCLUSIONS	Parents who received any assistance were more likely to quit smoking ; however , parents ' likelihood of quitting smoking was not statistically different between the intervention and control groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Maximizing parental quit rates will require more complete systems-level integration and adjunctive cessation strategies .

BACKGROUND	Polymorphisms of genes encoding the Fcy receptors ( Fc fragment of IgG receptor @A ( FCGR@A ) and @A ( FCGR@A ) ) , which influence their affinity for the Fc fragment , have been linked to the pharmacodynamics of monoclonal antibodies .
BACKGROUND	Most studies have been limited by small samples sizes and have reported inconsistent associations between the FCGR@A and the FCGR@A polymorphisms and clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patients treated with cetuximab .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the association of these polymorphisms and clinical outcome in a large cohort of mCRC patients treated with first-line @-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin ( Nordic FLOX ) + / - cetuximab in the NORDIC-VII study ( NCT@ ) .
METHODS	@ and @ mCRC patients were evaluable for the FCGR@A and FCGR@A genotyping , respectively .
METHODS	Genotyping was performed on TaqMan ABI HT @ ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) with pre-designed SNP genotyping assays for FCGR@A ( rs@ ) and FCGR@A ( rs@ ) .
RESULTS	The response rate for patients with the FCGR@A R/R genotype was significantly increased when cetuximab was added to Nordic FLOX ( @ % versus @ % , interaction P = @ ) , but was not significantly different compared to the response rate of patients with the FCGR@A H/H or H/R genotypes given the same treatment .
RESULTS	A larger increase in response rate with the addition of cetuximab to Nordic FLOX in patients with KRAS mutated tumors and the FCGR@A R/R genotype was observed ( @ % versus @ % , interaction P = @ ) .
RESULTS	None of the FCGR@A polymorphisms were associated with altered response when cetuximab was added to Nordic FLOX ( interaction P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Neither of the FCGR polymorphisms showed any significant associations with progression-free survival or overall survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with KRAS mutated tumors and the FCGR@A R/R polymorphism responded poorly when treated with chemotherapy only , and experienced the most benefit of the addition of cetuximab in terms of response rate .

###25112521
BACKGROUND	There is a large body of evidence for the involvement of the parietal cortex in orientation and navigation in space .
BACKGROUND	This has been supplemented by investigation of the contribution of a number of subregions using transcranial magnetic stimulation .
OBJECTIVE	The role of the precuneus area , located in the medial plane of posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) , in visuospatial functions is not well understood .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the contribution of this area using the landmark task .
METHODS	Participants were asked to make forced-choice judgments of which side of prebisected line was longer for near and far viewing conditions ( @ and @cm , respectively ) .
METHODS	Online @Hz , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) was delivered for @ms over the right precuneus , rPPC and vertex ( control ) , in separate blocks of trials .
METHODS	The rPPC stimulation was used as a positive control , having previously resulted in `` neglect like '' spatial bias effects in a number of studies .
RESULTS	A no-TMS condition showed a leftward spatial bias ( pseudoneglect ) for near space judgments but not for far space and was used as the baseline .
RESULTS	Precuneus stimulation resulted in rightward spatial bias from the midpoint in near space similar to the rPPC neglect-like effect .
RESULTS	No significant effects were seen with vertex stimulation .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that precuneus , like other parietal areas , is involved in visuospatial functions .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is required to clarify how the contribution of this area differs from other parietal regions .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether Care Navigation ( CN ) , a nurse-led hospital-based coordinated care intervention , reduced the use of hospital services and improved quality of life for patients with chronic illness .
METHODS	Randomised controlled trial ; participants were allocated to CN or standard care .
METHODS	Patients with chronic illness presenting to the emergency department of Nepean Hospital , Sydney , New South Wales .
METHODS	High-risk status for an unplanned admission was defined as i ) three or more unplanned hospital admissions in @ months for patients aged @ or at least one admission for cardiac or respiratory disease in patients aged @-@ years ; or ii ) judged by a CN nurse to be high risk and likely to benefit .
METHODS	Numbers of re-presentations or readmissions , quality of life , time to re-presentation , readmission or death , length of stay , and access to hospital and community health services .
RESULTS	@ participants were randomised between May @ and February @ ; @ by previous unplanned admission and @ by clinical impression .
RESULTS	The CN group received more community health services ( rate ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) than participants receiving standard care ; however , this did not result in statistically significant differences in number of re-presentations ( rate ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , number of readmissions ( rate ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , quality of life at @ months ( mean difference , @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ , P = @ ) , or other measures .
CONCLUSIONS	CN did not improve quality of life or reduce unplanned hospital presentations or admissions despite community health services almost doubling .
CONCLUSIONS	Future service development should explore potential benefits of linking navigated intrahospital care to ongoing , proactive care planning and delivery in the community .

###24952836
OBJECTIVE	For people with chronic low back pain , does Kinesio Taping , applied according to the treatment manual to create skin convolutions , reduce pain and disability more than a simple application without convolutions ?
METHODS	Randomised trial with concealed allocation , intention-to-treat analysis and blinded assessment of some outcomes .
METHODS	@ participants with chronic non-specific low back pain .
METHODS	Experimental group participants received eight sessions ( over four weeks ) of Kinesio Taping applied according to the Kinesio Taping Method treatment manual ( ie , @ to @ % tension applied in flexion to create skin convolutions in neutral ) .
METHODS	Control group participants received eight sessions ( over four weeks ) of Kinesio Taping with no tension , creating no convolutions .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were pain intensity and disability after the four-week intervention .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were pain intensity and disability @ weeks after randomisation , and global perceived effect at both four and @ weeks after randomisation .
RESULTS	Applying Kinesio Tape to create convolutions in the skin did not significantly change its effect on pain ( MD-@ @ points , @ % CI-@ @ to @ ) or disability ( MD-@ @ points , @ % CI-@ @ to @ ) at four weeks .
RESULTS	There was a small difference in favour of the experimental group for the secondary outcome of global perceived effect ( MD @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ) at four weeks .
RESULTS	No significant between-group differences were observed for the other secondary outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Kinesio Taping applied with stretch to generate convolutions in the skin was no more effective than simple application of the tape without tension for the outcomes measured .
CONCLUSIONS	These results challenge the proposed mechanism of action of this therapy .

###24599111
OBJECTIVE	The estimation of effect size in clinical trials commonly disregards recurrent outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effectiveness of a complex intervention on recurrent outcomes in patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	In the Diabetes Care in General Practice ( DCGP ) randomised controlled trial , @,@ patients newly diagnosed with type @ diabetes were randomised to @ years of structured personal care or routine care ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT@ ) .
METHODS	The trial had @ years of registry-based follow-up and was analysed with Cox regression models .
METHODS	Repeated occurrences in the same patient of outcomes ( any diabetes-related endpoint , myocardial infarction -LSB- MI -RSB- , stroke , peripheral vascular disease and microvascular disease ) were accounted for with the Wei , Lin and Weissfeld method .
RESULTS	As previously shown , the intervention reduced the rates of first occurrence of both MI and any diabetes-related endpoint .
RESULTS	However , for all outcomes , the HR for a second event showed a statistically non-significant tendency to be increased .
RESULTS	We estimated a combined HR for all marginal failure times , regardless of whether they were first , second or later events .
RESULTS	This showed that the intervention had no effect on the rate of any of the outcomes , including MI ( HR @ , @ % CI @ , @ ) and any diabetes-related endpoint ( HR @ , @ % CI @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In the DCGP study , a smaller proportion of patients who received structured care experienced a first occurrence of MI or any diabetes-related endpoint compared with patients who received routine care .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the patients who received structured care tended to experience more recurrent outcomes , so the total outcome rate was not affected by the intervention .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to report additional safety results from the ROCKET AF ( Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation ) .
BACKGROUND	The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated similar risks of stroke/systemic embolism and major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding ( principal safety endpoint ) with rivaroxaban and warfarin .
METHODS	The risk of the principal safety and component bleeding endpoints with rivaroxaban versus warfarin were compared , and factors associated with major bleeding were examined in a multivariable model .
RESULTS	The principal safety endpoint was similar in the rivaroxaban and warfarin groups ( @ vs. @ events/@ patient-years ; hazard ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Major bleeding risk increased with age , but there were no differences between treatments in each age category ( < @ , @ to @,@ years ; pinteraction = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with those without ( n = @,@ ) , patients with a major bleed ( n = @ ) were more likely to be older , current/prior smokers , have prior gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding , mild anemia , and a lower calculated creatinine clearance and less likely to be female or have a prior stroke/transient ischemic attack .
RESULTS	Increasing age , baseline diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) @ mm Hg , history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or GI bleeding , prior acetylsalicylic acid use , and anemia were independently associated with major bleeding risk ; female sex and DBP < @ mm Hg were associated with a decreased risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar risk for major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	Age , sex , DBP , prior GI bleeding , prior acetylsalicylic acid use , and anemia were associated with the risk of major bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	( An Efficacy and Safety Study of Rivaroxaban With Warfarin for the Prevention of Stroke and Non-Central Nervous System Systemic Embolism in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation : NCT@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) versus common laryngeal mask airway in children with general anesthesia .
METHODS	With local research ethics committee 's approval and written informed parental consent , @ children were randomly divided into groups L ( size @ common laryngeal mask airway ) and S ( size @ laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) ) according to random number ( n = @ each ) .
METHODS	After anesthesia induction , a common laryngeal mask airway or laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) was inserted and mechanically ventilated .
METHODS	Time and ease for insertion , insertion success rate , airway leak pressure , success rate and ease of disposal sputum collecting tube insertion in group S , quality of airway during anesthetic maintenance , abdominal circumference changes and complications within @ h post-operation were measured .
RESULTS	Compared with group L , abdominal circumference increased less in group S ( @ @ vs @ @ cm , n = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant inter-group differences existed for other measurements .
RESULTS	Disposal sputum collecting tube was successfully placed in group S ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In children with mechanical ventilation , laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) can be effectively applied to maintain a good airway .
CONCLUSIONS	And the incidence of gastric insufflation is lower .
CONCLUSIONS	It is particularly useful for those requiring evacuation of gastric contents during general anesthesia .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this trial was to evaluate crestal bone level changes radiographically in a standardized fashion over a period of @ months in humans for implants with a @-mm machined collar ( implant type A ) versus type B implants with a @-mm machined collar .
METHODS	Twenty-five patients with multiple missing teeth in posterior sectors were randomly assigned to one of the two groups : A ( @-mm machined-collar implants ) or B ( @-mm machined-collar implants ) .
METHODS	Changes at crestal bone level were assessed by measuring the shoulder-crest distance ( SCD ) on the mesial and distal aspects of each implant on customized periapical radiographs , which were taken on the day of surgery and @ , @ , and @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	Eighty-one implants were included in the study .
RESULTS	Mean SCD was @ @ mm at baseline and @ @ mm after @ months .
RESULTS	For @-mm-collar implants , mean SCD was @ @ mm , while it was @ @ mm for @-mm-collar implants .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences were found only between the two types of implants for distal measurements at @ and @ months after placement .
CONCLUSIONS	Both @ - and @-mm machined-collar implants can be used with predictable results , as changes in peri-implant crestal bone levels are similar for both implant types and do not seem to be significant from a clinical point of view .
CONCLUSIONS	The SCD may well depend more on the location of the abutment-implant interface than on machined-collar height .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the early childhood pulmonary outcomes of infants who participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 's Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial ( SUPPORT ) , using a factorial design that randomized extremely preterm infants to lower vs higher oxygen saturation targets and delivery room continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) vs intubation/surfactant .
METHODS	The Breathing Outcomes Study , a prospective secondary study to the Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial , assessed respiratory morbidity at @-month intervals from hospital discharge to @-@ months corrected age ( CA ) .
METHODS	Two prespecified primary outcomes-wheezing more than twice per week during the worst @-week period and cough longer than @ days without a cold-were compared for each randomized intervention .
RESULTS	One or more interviews were completed for @ of the @ eligible infants .
RESULTS	The incidences of wheezing and cough were @ % and @ % , respectively , and did not differ between the study arms of either randomized intervention .
RESULTS	Infants randomized to lower vs higher oxygen saturation targets had a similar risk of death or respiratory morbidity ( except for croup and treatment with oxygen or diuretics at home ) .
RESULTS	Infants randomized to CPAP vs intubation/surfactant had fewer episodes of wheezing without a cold ( @ % vs @ % ; P < @ ) , respiratory illnesses diagnosed by a doctor ( @ % vs @ % ; P < @ ) , and physician or emergency room visits for breathing problems ( @ % vs @ % ; P < @ ) by @-@ months CA .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with early CPAP rather than intubation/surfactant is associated with less respiratory morbidity by @-@ months CA .
CONCLUSIONS	Longitudinal assessment of pulmonary morbidity is necessary to fully evaluate the potential benefits of respiratory interventions for neonates .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether a polyethylene total body wrapping ( covering both the body and head ) is more effective than conventional treatment ( covering up to the shoulders ) in reducing perinatal thermal losses in very preterm infants .
METHODS	This was a multicenter , prospective , randomized , parallel @:@ , unblinded , controlled trial of infants < @ weeks ' gestation age , comprising two study groups : experimental group ( total body group ; both the body and head covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag , with the face uncovered ) and control group ( only the body , up to the shoulders , covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission immediately after wrap removal .
RESULTS	One hundred randomly allocated infants ( @ in the total body group and @ controls ) completed the study .
RESULTS	Mean axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission was similar in the two groups ( @ C total body vs @ C controls ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The rate of moderate hypothermia ( temperature < @C ) was @ % in the total body group and @ % in the control group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Three subjects in each group ( @ % ) had an axillary temperature > @ C on admission , and one subject in control group had an axillary temperature > @C .
CONCLUSIONS	Total body wrapping is comparable with covering the body up to the shoulders in preventing postnatal thermal losses in very preterm infants .

BACKGROUND	Available preclinical and phase @ clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , to chemotherapy might improve outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC after platinum-based therapy .
METHODS	In this unmasked , open-label randomised phase @ trial we enrolled patients with metastatic , unresectable , or locally advanced NSCLC from @ sites in Canada and the USA .
METHODS	Eligible patients were those aged @ years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen .
METHODS	Initially , patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed ( @ mg/m ( @ ) ) or docetaxel ( @ mg/m ( @ ) ) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab ( @ mg/m ( @ ) at first dose and @ mg/m ( @ ) weekly thereafter ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
METHODS	However , after a change in the standard of care , investigators chose whether to treat with pemetrexed or docetaxel on a patient-by-patient basis .
METHODS	The primary analysis was changed to compare progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed , on an intention-to-treat basis .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between Jan @ , @ , and Feb @ , @ , we enrolled @ patients ; data for one patient was accidentally discarded .
RESULTS	Of the remaining @ patients , @ received pemetrexed ( @ patients with cetuximab and @ alone ) and @ received docetaxel ( @ in combination with cetuximab and @ alone ) .
RESULTS	Median progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) versus @ months ( @-@ ) with pemetrexed ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The most common grade @-@ adverse events with cetuximab plus pemetrexed were fatigue ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ) , acneiform rash ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , dyspnoea ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and decreased neutrophil count ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and with pemetrexed alone were dyspnoea ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ) , decreased neutrophil count ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and fatigue ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	A significantly higher proportion of patients in the cetuximab plus pemetrexed group ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ) experienced at least one serious adverse event than those patients in the pemetrexed group ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Nine ( @ % ) of @ treated patients in the cetuximab and pemetrexed group died of adverse events compared with five ( @ % ) of @ treated patients in the pemetrexed alone group .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of cetuximab is not recommended in combination with chemotherapy in patients previously treated with platinum-based therapy .

BACKGROUND	Some studies suggest better overall outcomes when right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy ( RUL ECT ) is given with an ultrabrief , rather than brief , pulse width .
METHODS	The aim of the study was to test if ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT results in less cognitive side effects than brief - pulse RUL ECT , when given at doses which achieve comparable efficacy .
METHODS	One hundred and two participants were assigned to receive ultrabrief ( at @ times seizure threshold ) or brief ( at @ times seizure threshold ) pulse RUL ECT in a double-blind , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Blinded raters assessed mood and cognitive functioning over the ECT course .
RESULTS	Efficacy outcomes were not found to be significantly different .
RESULTS	The ultrabrief group showed less cognitive impairment immediately after a single session of ECT , and over the treatment course ( autobiographical memory , orientation ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In summary , when ultrabrief RUL ECT was given at a higher dosage than brief RUL ECT ( @ versus @ times seizure threshold ) , efficacy was comparable while cognitive impairment was less .

BACKGROUND	Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) is a major public health concern , particularly in endemic areas like Asia-Pacific .
BACKGROUND	Sustained virologic suppression correlates with regression of histologic fibrosis and cirrhosis .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) in Asian patients through @ weeks of treatment .
METHODS	Post hoc analysis of the Asian subpopulation from two phase @ clinical studies was performed .
METHODS	Following a @-week randomized , double-blind evaluation of once-daily TDF versus once-daily adefovir dipivoxil , open-label TDF for up to @ weeks was evaluated .
METHODS	Patients with both baseline and week @ liver biopsies were evaluated for histologic changes .
RESULTS	At baseline , @/@ ( @ % ) patients randomized were Asian .
RESULTS	Sixty-eight percent of Asian patients were male ; @ % were hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) - positive .
RESULTS	At week @ , similar proportions of Asian ( @ % ) and non-Asian ( @ % ) patients demonstrated improvement in liver histology , and @/@ ( @ % ) Asian patients with baseline cirrhosis were no longer cirrhotic .
RESULTS	By modified intent-to-treat analysis , @ % of Asian patients and @ % of non-Asian patients had HBV DNA < @ copies/mL at the end of week @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No differences were seen in HBeAg loss or seroconversion in Asian versus non-Asian patients .
RESULTS	No Asian patient experienced hepatitis B surface antigen loss .
RESULTS	Safety and tolerability of TDF through week @ , including changes in renal function and in hip/spine bone mineral density ( from weeks @ to @ ) , were comparable between Asian and non-Asian patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term virologic and histologic efficacy and safety of TDF are comparable in Asian and non-Asian CHB patients .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of exogenous i.m. glucagon on recovery from controlled insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in patients with type @ diabetes treated with the novel glucokinase activator AZD@ , in combination with metformin .
METHODS	This was a single-centre randomized , open , two-way crossover phase I , automated glucose clamp ( Biostator ( ) ; Life Science Instruments , Elkhart , MD , USA ) study ( NCT@ ) in eight patients ( seven men and one woman , mean age @ years , body mass index @ kg/m ( @ ) ) .
METHODS	All patients received a stable dose of metformin twice daily , ranging from @ to @ mg .
METHODS	A @-day titration phase commenced with @ mg AZD@ twice daily , escalating to @ mg twice daily if tolerated .
METHODS	This was followed by a single dose of @ or @ mg AZD@ , administered on days @ and @ when metabolic studies were performed .
METHODS	After an overnight fast on days @ and @ , controlled hypoglycaemia was induced using an exogenous i.v. infusion of insulin .
METHODS	Plasma glucose was lowered in a stepwise fashion over @ h to attain a target nadir of @ mmol/l .
METHODS	This was sustained for @ min , at the end of which the hypoglycaemic clamp was released .
METHODS	In random sequence , patients either received an i.m. injection of @ mg glucagon or were allowed to recover from hypoglycaemia by endogenous counter-regulation .
METHODS	To avoid prolonged hypoglycaemia , a reverse glucose clamp was applied from @ to @ h post-dose .
RESULTS	Three patients received @ mg AZD@ twice daily and five patients @ mg twice daily .
RESULTS	Mean plasma glucose at @ min after release of the hypoglycaemic clamp was significantly lower ( @ @ mmol/l ) for AZD@ alone than for AZD@ + glucagon ( @ @ mmol/l ; p < @ between the groups ) .
RESULTS	Catecholamine and cortisol responses were similar on the AZD@ + glucagon and AZD alone study days .
RESULTS	Growth hormone response was @ % lower for AZD@ alone ( p = @ ) , consistent with the effect of a pharmacological dose of glucagon on growth hormone secretion .
RESULTS	No safety or tolerability concerns were observed during treatment with AZ@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Exogenous glucagon was effective as a rescue treatment for hypoglycaemia induced during treatment with AZD@ , given in combination with metformin in patients with type @ diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	Retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS ) involves a minimally invasive stone surgery , lending itself potential to combined spinal-epidural anesthesia ( CSEA ) , although it is performed preferably under general anesthesia ( GA ) .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective randomized study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CSEA for patients undergoing RIRS .
METHODS	Seventy consecutive patients who were scheduled for RIRS were randomized to receive CSEA ( n = @ ) or GA ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Operative time , stone clearance rate , visual analog scale ( VAS ) of pain , complication rate , anesthetic cost , and hospital stay were compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients randomized to CSEA ( @ ) or GA ( @ ) completed the study .
RESULTS	In the CSEA group , each procedure was completed and there was no anesthetic conversion .
RESULTS	Although based on the prospective randomized method , the GA group still had a little larger stone size ( p = @ ) and more multiple caliceal stones ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall , there were no statistically significant differences in operative time ( p = @ ) , stone fragmentation time ( p = @ ) , postoperative VAS pain score at @ and @ hours ( p = @ , @ ) , incidence of complications ( p = @ ) , stone-free rate ( p = @ ) , and hospital stays ( p = @ ) between the two groups .
RESULTS	The patients in the GA group experienced a higher mean hemoglobin drop ( @ vs @ g/L , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , the anesthetic cost was much cheaper in the CSEA group ( @ vs @ dollars , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	RIRS with CSEA can be completed with no anesthetic conversions and with the same efficacy and safety compared with GA. .
CONCLUSIONS	When considering economical aspects , CSEA appears to be a preferable alternative to GA for the patient whose general health status permits it .

BACKGROUND	Progesterone is effective treatment for hot flushes/night sweats .
BACKGROUND	The cardiovascular effects of progesterone therapy are unknown but evidence suggests that premenopausal normal estradiol with also normal progesterone levels may provide later cardiovascular protection .
BACKGROUND	We compared the effects of progesterone to placebo on endothelial function , weight , blood pressure , metabolism , lipids , inflammation and coagulation .
RESULTS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , @-month placebo-controlled trial of progesterone ( @ mg daily ) among @ healthy postmenopausal women in Vancouver , Canada from @-@ .
RESULTS	Endothelial function by venous occlusion plethysmography was a planned primary outcome .
RESULTS	Enrolled women were @-@ y since last menstruation , not using hormones ( for > @ months ) , non-smoking , without diabetes , hypertension , heart disease or their medications .
RESULTS	Randomized ( @ ) women ( @ @ years , body mass index @ @ ) initially had normal blood pressure , fasting lipid , glucose and electrocardiogram results .
RESULTS	Endothelial function ( % forearm blood flow above saline ) was not changed with progesterone ( @ @ % , n = @ ) compared with placebo ( @ @ % , n = @ ) ( @ % CI diff -LSB- -@ to @ -RSB- , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Progesterone ( n = @ ) and placebo ( n = @ ) groups had similar changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , resting heart rate , weight , body mass index , waist circumference , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels .
RESULTS	High-density lipoprotein was lower ( -@ mmol/L , P = @ ) on progesterone compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Fasting glucose , hs-C-reactive protein , albumin and D-dimer changes were all comparable to placebo .
RESULTS	Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Profile scores were initially low and remained low with progesterone therapy and not statistically different from placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Results indicate that progesterone has short-term cardiovascular safety .
CONCLUSIONS	Endothelial function , weight , blood pressure , waist circumference , inflammation and coagulation were unchanged as were lipids except for HDL-C .
CONCLUSIONS	The statistically significant decrease in HDL-C levels was not clinically important ( based on lack of Cardiovascular Risk Profile change ) .

OBJECTIVE	Afterschool programs can be health-promoting environments for children .
OBJECTIVE	Written policies positively influence nutrition and physical activity ( PA ) environments , but effective strategies for building staff capacity to write such policies have not been evaluated .
OBJECTIVE	This study measures the comprehensiveness of written nutrition , PA , and screen time policies in afterschool programs and assesses impact of the Out of School Nutrition and Physical Activity ( OSNAP ) intervention on key policies .
METHODS	Twenty afterschool programs in Boston , MA participated in a group-randomized , controlled trial from September @ to June @ .
METHODS	Intervention program staff attended learning collaboratives focused on practice and policy change .
METHODS	The Out-of-School Time ( OST ) Policy Assessment Index evaluated written policies .
METHODS	Inter-rater reliability and construct validity of the measure and impact of the intervention on written policies were assessed .
RESULTS	The measure demonstrated moderate to excellent inter-rater reliability ( Spearman 's r = @ to @ ) and construct validity .
RESULTS	OSNAP was associated with significant increases in standards-based policy statements surrounding snacks ( +@ , p = @ ) , beverages ( +@ , p = @ ) , screen time ( +@ , p = @ ) , family communication ( +@ , p = @ ) , and a summary index of OSNAP goals ( +@ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	OSNAP demonstrated success in building staff capacity to write health-promoting policy statements .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should focus on determining policy change impact on practices .

OBJECTIVE	Nut consumption has been found to decrease risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes and to promote healthy body weights possibly related to their favorable macronutrient profile .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore assessed the effect of pistachios on postprandial glucose and insulin levels , gut hormones related to satiety and endothelial function .
METHODS	In this randomized crossover study , @ subjects with metabolic syndrome consumed five study meals over @-@ weeks .
METHODS	The meals differed in fat type and quantity , but were matched according to available carbohydrates ( CHOs ) .
METHODS	Three meals had @ g available CHO : white bread ( WB@g ) , white bread , butter and cheese ( WB+B+C h ) and white bread and pistachios ( WB+P ) .
METHODS	Two meals had @ g available CHO : white bread ( WB@g ) and pistachios ( P ) .
RESULTS	Within each group of available CHO meals , postprandial glucose levels were the highest following the white bread-only meals , and glucose response was significantly attenuated when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Postprandial insulin levels were highest after the WB+B+C h meal ( P < @ ) , but did not differ between the white bread-only and pistachio meals .
RESULTS	Both endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index ) and arterial stiffness ( augmentation index ) significantly increased after the white bread-only meals compared with the WB+B+C h meal ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Insulin secretagogue levels were higher when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed than when white bread only was consumed ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with white bread , pistachio consumption reduced postprandial glycemia , increased glucagon-like-peptide levels and may have insulin-sparing properties .
CONCLUSIONS	These effects could be beneficial for individuals with diabetes and metabolic syndrome .

BACKGROUND	Bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival ( PFS ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
BACKGROUND	We analysed the protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ligands and receptors to determine their prognostic and predictive effects .
METHODS	We graded expression of VEGF-A , VEGF-B , VEGF-C , VEGF-D , VEGF-R@ , and VEGF-R@ to assess whether overexpression predicted bevacizumab resistance in samples from @ of @ patients randomised to capecitabine ( C ) , capecitabine and bevacizumab ( CB ) , or CB and mitomycin ( CBM ) in the MAX trial and extended the analysis to the CAIRO-@ population .
RESULTS	Patients with low expression of VEGF-D ( @ , @ ) benefited from bevacizumab treatment ( PFS hazard ratio ( HR ) ( C vs CBCBM ) , @ ; @ % CI , @ ; overall survival ( OS ) HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with higher VEGF-D expression received less benefit ( VEGF-D @ PFS HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ ; OS HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ ; VEGF-D @ PFS HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ ; OS HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ ) ( P interaction o@ @ ) .
RESULTS	In CAIRO-@ , there was no difference in PFS or OS according to VEGF-D expression .
CONCLUSIONS	The predictive value of VEGF-D expression for bevacizumab may depend on the chemotherapy backbone used .
CONCLUSIONS	Further evaluation is required before clinical utilisation .

###25122186
BACKGROUND	Abnormalities in cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may help identify patients at particularly high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
RESULTS	Cardiac structure and function were assessed by echocardiography in a blinded core laboratory at baseline in @ patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( left ventricular ejection fraction @ % ) enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist ( TOPCAT ) trial and related to the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death , heart failure hospitalization , or aborted cardiac arrest , and its components .
RESULTS	At a median follow-up of @ years , @ patients experienced the primary outcome .
RESULTS	Left ventricular hypertrophy ( adjusted hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) , elevated left ventricular filling pressure ( E/E ' ; adjusted hazard ratio @ per @ integer increase ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) , and higher pulmonary artery pressure assessed by the tricuspid regurgitation velocity ( hazard ratio , @ per @ m/s increase ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) were associated with the composite outcome and heart failure hospitalization alone after adjusting for clinical and laboratory variables .
RESULTS	The risk of adverse outcome associated with left ventricular hypertrophy was additive to the risk associated with elevated E/E ' .
CONCLUSIONS	Among heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients enrolled in TOPCAT , left ventricular hypertrophy , higher left ventricular filling pressure , and higher pulmonary artery pressure were predictive of heart failure hospitalization , cardiovascular death , or aborted cardiac arrest independent of clinical and laboratory predictors .
CONCLUSIONS	These features , both alone and in combination , identify heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients at particularly high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .

BACKGROUND	The clinical benefits of bioimpedance spectroscopy ( BIS ) - guided fluid management in patients on hemodialysis have been widely demonstrated .
BACKGROUND	However , no previous reports have evaluated the effect of regular and serial BIS-guided fluid management on the residual renal function ( RRF ) in patients on peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we will evaluate the clinical efficacy of BIS-guided fluid management for preserving RRF and protecting cardiovascular events in patients on PD .
METHODS	This is a multicenter , prospective , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	A total of @ participants on PD will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided fluid management or fluid management based only on the clinical information for @ year .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the change in the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) between months @ and @ after starting treatment .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes will include GFR at month @ , time to the anuric state ( urine volume < @ ml/day ) , and fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events during treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first clinical trial to investigate the effect of BIS-guided fluid management on RRF and for protecting against cardiovascular events in patients on PD .

###24307845
OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to compare the mucosal findings after esophagogastroduodenoscopy in two groups before and after the use of alendronate only and following administration of the enteric-coated alendronate ( @ mg ) and calcitriol ( @ g ) combined drug ( Maxmarvil , Yuyu Co. ) .
METHODS	The study population consisted of @ postmenopausal healthy female volunteers , aged @ to @ years ( mean age , @ @ ) without gastrointestinal symptoms and with normal baseline endoscopic findings .
METHODS	Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at baseline and was repeated @ weeks later after daily intake of Maxmarvil ( n = @ subjects ) or alendronate only ( n = @ subjects ) .
METHODS	Mucosal injury scores were reported by an endoscopist after @ weeks of treatment with each medication schedule .
RESULTS	Esophageal mucosal injuries developed in two of @ subjects in the alendronate only group and @ of @ in the Maxmarvil group .
RESULTS	Gastric mucosal injuries developed in eight subjects in the alendronate group and four subjects in the Maxmarvil group ; this difference was statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	The mucosal damage scores for the alendronate group ( total score @ ) were significantly higher than those for the Maxmarvil group ( total score @ ) in the esophagus and stomach .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , this study suggested that enteric-coated Maxmarvil is less harmful to gastrointestinal mucosa than alendronate , and may improve the tolerability of osteoporosis medication in clinical practice .

###24723432
OBJECTIVE	Although antidepressant drugs are used as first-line intervention to treat patients with generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , only one-third of patients respond positively to treatment .
OBJECTIVE	In our study , we investigated whether functional genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine active transporter @ ( DAT@ ) and dopamine receptor D@ ( DRD@ ) may play a role in antidepressant treatment response in GAD .
METHODS	We examined @ patients diagnosed with GAD who received venlafaxine Extended-Release ( XR ) treatment as part of an @-month relapse-prevention study to determine whether variation in these genes had an effect on treatment response after @months of open-label treatment .
METHODS	Genotypes were obtained for rs@ ( DRD@ ) , rs@ ( DRD@ ) , rs@ ( DAT@ ) , and a variable number tandem repeat in the @ ' untranslated region of the DAT@ gene using standard methods .
RESULTS	Results show that none of the tested variants were associated with treatment response to venlafaxine XR in GAD .
RESULTS	Genotype and allele frequencies did not differ statistically significantly between responders and non-responders using either the Hamilton Anxiety or Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement Scale at @months .
CONCLUSIONS	Although we detected no association in our sample , future studies using larger samples and more comprehensive gene coverage are needed to evaluate potential effects of dopaminergic variants on antidepressant treatment response in anxiety disorders .

BACKGROUND	In non-small-cell lung cancer , an exon @ deletion and an L@R point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are predictors of a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
BACKGROUND	However , it is uncertain whether other uncommon EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
METHODS	A post-hoc analysis to assess prognostic factors was performed with the use of patients with EGFR mutations ( exon @ deletion , L@R , G@X , and L@Q ) who were treated with gefitinib in the NEJ@ study , which compared gefitinib with carboplatin-paclitaxel as the first-line therapy .
RESULTS	In the NEJ@ study , @ patients with EGFR mutations received gefitinib at any treatment line .
RESULTS	The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that performance status , response to chemotherapy , response to gefitinib , and mutation types were significant prognostic factors .
RESULTS	Overall survival ( OS ) was significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations ( G@X or L@Q ) compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations ( @ versus @ months ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the gefitinib group ( n = @ ) , patients with uncommon EGFR mutations had a significantly shorter OS ( @ versus @ months ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	By contrast , OS was similar between patients with uncommon mutations and those with common mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group ( n = @ ; @ versus @ months ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The post-hoc analyses clearly demonstrated shorter survival for gefitinib-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the survival of those with common mutations and suggest that the first-line chemotherapy may be relatively effective for non-small-cell lung cancer with uncommon EGFR mutations .

OBJECTIVE	To compare refractive changes after corneal crosslinking with and without mechanical compression of the cornea .
METHODS	In a prospective , open , randomized case-control study conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology , Ume University Hospital , Sweden , sixty eyes of @ patients with progressive keratoconus aged @-@ years planned for corneal crosslinking and corresponding age - and sex-matched control subjects were included .
METHODS	The patients were randomized to conventional corneal crosslinking ( CXL ; n = @ ) or corneal crosslinking with mechanical compression using a flat rigid contact lens sutured to the cornea during treatment ( CRXL ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Subjective refraction and ETDRS best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA ) , axial length measurement , keratometry and pachymetry were performed before and @ and @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	The keratoconus patients had poorer BSCVA , higher refractive astigmatism and higher keratometry readings than the control subjects at baseline ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the CXL group , BSCVA increased from @ @ to @ @ logMar ( p = @ ) , and the spherical equivalent improved from -@ @ D to -@ @ D ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Maximum keratometry readings decreased after CXL from @ @ D to @ @ D ( p = @ ) , and the axial length decreased in the CXL group , likely due to post-treatment corneal thinning ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the CRXL group , all the above variables were unaltered ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	At @ months , the refractive results from CRXL did not surpass those of conventional CXL treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Rather , some variables indicated a slightly inferior effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Possibly , stronger crosslinking would be necessary to stabilize the cornea in the flattened configuration achieved by the rigid contact lens .

BACKGROUND	Although coexisting obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration ( CSR ) occur frequently in patients with heart diseases , optimal treatment remains unclear .
BACKGROUND	Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) effectively treats OSA and adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV ) has been shown to improve CSR .
BACKGROUND	We compared a new treatment algorithm combining automatic continuous positive airway pressure ( APAP ) and ASV ( anticyclic modulated ventilation , ACMV ) versus continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) .
METHODS	Thirty-nine patients ( @ male , four female ; aged @ years ; body mass index , @ kg/m@ ) with underlying heart disease and coexisting OSA and CSR were enrolled .
METHODS	After diagnostic polysomnography ( PSG ) and CPAP titration , patients were randomized either to CPAP or to ACMV for four weeks of treatment in a crossover design .
RESULTS	Total apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) was @ / h at baseline , @ / h with CPAP ( P < @ vs baseline ) , and @ / h with ACMV ( P < @ vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) .
RESULTS	Obstructive AHI was @ / h at baseline , @ / h with CPAP ( P < @ vs. baseline ) , and @ / h with ACMV ( P < @ vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) .
RESULTS	Central AHI was @ / h at baseline , @ / h with CPAP ( P < @ vs baseline ) and @ / h with ACMV ( P < @ vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) .
RESULTS	Ejection fraction was increased significantly ( from @ to @ % ) only with ACMV .
RESULTS	Subjective sleepiness significantly improved only with CPAP whereas objective sleep quality and treatment adherence were not different between both treatment modalities .
CONCLUSIONS	ACMV is an effective treatment option in patients with coexisting OSA and CSR .
CONCLUSIONS	It is superior to CPAP in reducing total AHI as well as obstructive and central AHI .

BACKGROUND	HER@ and TOP@A gene status are assessed for diagnostic and research purposes in breast cancer with fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
BACKGROUND	However , FISH probes do not target only the annotated gene , while chromosome @ ( chr@ ) is among the most unstable chromosomes in breast cancer .
BACKGROUND	Here we asked whether the status of specifically targeted genes on chr@ might help in refining prognosis of early high-risk breast cancer patients .
METHODS	Copy numbers ( CN ) for @ genes on chr@ , @ of which were within and @ outside the core HER@ amplicon ( HER@ - and non-HER@-genes , respectively ) were assessed with qPCR in @ paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in the frame of two randomized phase III trials .
RESULTS	HER@-genes CN strongly correlated to each other ( Spearman 's rho > @ ) and were concordant with FISH HER@ status ( Kappa @ for ERBB@ CN ) .
RESULTS	TOP@A CN were not concordant with TOP@A FISH status ( Kappa @ ) .
RESULTS	CN hierarchical clustering revealed distinct patterns of gains , losses and complex alterations in HER@ - and non-HER@-genes associated with IHC@ breast cancer subtypes .
RESULTS	Upon multivariate analysis , non-HER@-gene gains independently predicted for shorter disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with triple-negative cancer , as compared to luminal and HER@-positive tumors ( interaction p = @ for DFS and p = @ for OS ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , non-HER@-gene gains were associated with worse prognosis in patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery as compared to modified radical mastectomy ( p = @ for both DFS and OS ) .
RESULTS	Non-HER@-gene losses were unfavorable prognosticators in patients with @-@ metastatic nodes , as compared to those with @ or more nodes ( p = @ for DFS and p = @ for OS ) .
CONCLUSIONS	TOP@A FISH and qPCR may not identify the same pathology on chr@q .
CONCLUSIONS	Non-HER@ chr@ CN patterns may further predict outcome in breast cancer patients with known favorable and unfavorable prognosis .

BACKGROUND	Heart failure ( HF ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) frequently coexist , with undefined prognostic and therapeutic implications .
BACKGROUND	We investigated clinical profile and outcomes of patients with chronic HF and COPD , notably the efficacy and safety of ivabradine , a heart rate-reducing agent .
METHODS	@ ambulatory patients , in sinus rhythm , heart rate @ bpm and stable systolic HF were randomised to placebo or ivabradine ( @ to @ mg bid ) .
METHODS	Multivariate Cox model analyses were performed to compare the COPD ( n = @ ) and non-COPD subgroups , and the ivabradine and placebo treatment effects .
RESULTS	COPD patients were older and had a poorer risk profile .
RESULTS	Beta-blockers were prescribed to @ % of COPD patients and @ % of non-COPD patients .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint ( PEP ) and its component , hospitalisation for worsening HF , were more frequent in COPD patients ( HRs f , @ -LSB- p = @ -RSB- ; and @ -LSB- p < @ -RSB- ) respectively , but relative risk was reduced similarly by ivabradine in both COPD ( @ % , and @ % ) and non-COPD ( @ % and @ % ) patients ( p interaction = @ , and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Similar effect was noted also for cardiovascular death .
RESULTS	Adverse events were more common in COPD patients , but similar in treatment subgroups .
RESULTS	Bradycardia occurred more frequently in ivabradine subgroups , with similar incidence in patients with or without COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	The association of COPD and HF results in a worse prognosis , and COPD represents a barrier to optimisation of beta-blocker therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Ivabradine is similarly effective and safe in chronic HF patients with or without COPD , and can be safely combined with beta-blockers in COPD .

OBJECTIVE	Although several eating disorder prevention programs reduce eating disorder risk factors and symptoms for female high school and college students , few efficacious prevention programs exist for female middle school students , despite the fact that body image and eating disturbances often emerge then .
OBJECTIVE	Two pilot trials evaluated a new dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program for middle school girls with body image concerns .
METHODS	Female middle school students with body dissatisfaction from two sites -LSB- Study @ : N = @ , M age = @ , standard deviation ( SD ) = @ ; Study @ : N = @ , M age = @ , SD = @ -RSB- were randomized to a dissonance intervention ( MS Body Project ) or educational brochure control ; Study @ included a @-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Intervention participants showed significant post-test reductions in only one of the six variables with both Studies @ and @ ( i.e. , pressure to be thin and negative affect , respectively ) , though post-test effect sizes suggested medium reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms ( Study @ : M d = @ ; Study @ : M d = @ ) ; reductions at @-month follow-up in Study @ were not evident ( M d = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Results suggest that this new middle school version of the Body Project is producing medium magnitude reductions in eating disorder risk factors at post-test but that effects are showing limited persistence .
CONCLUSIONS	Continued refinement and evaluation of this intervention appears warranted to develop more effective prevention programs for this age group .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral glutamine ( GL ) supplementation on gut permeability and endotoxemia ( surrogate end point ) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis .
METHODS	In a randomized controlled trial , patients were randomized to be given placebo or GL for @ days .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures include the effect on gut permeability ( assessed by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine and endotoxemia assessed by endotoxin core antibodies type IgG and IgM ( EndoCab IgG and IgM ) .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measures include infectious complications , mortality , total hospital/intensive care unit stay , C-reactive protein , and prealbumin levels .
RESULTS	Patients were assigned to GL ( n = @ ) and placebo ( n = @ ) groups .
RESULTS	There was no change in gut permeability after the intervention .
RESULTS	However , the EndoCab IgM levels increased significantly ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- to @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- GMU/mL ; P = @ ) and the C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- to @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- ng/mL ; P = @ ) in the GL group .
RESULTS	No difference was observed in infectious complication , prealbumin value , hospital/intensive care unit stay , and mortality in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	No significant trend was identified for an effect of GL on gut permeability .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreased inflammation and endotoxemia did not translate into reduced infectious complications in severe acute pancreatitis .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the study was underpowered to detect the aforementioned difference ( trial registration : CTRI/@/@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Tapentadol is an analgesic agent for treatment of acute and chronic pain that activates the - opioid receptor combined with inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake .
BACKGROUND	Both mechanisms are implicated in activation of descending inhibitory pain pathways .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we investigated the influence of tapentadol on conditioned pain modulation ( CPM , an experimental measure of endogenous pain inhibition that gates incoming pain signals as a consequence of a preceding tonic painful stimulus ) and offset analgesia ( OA , a test in which a disproportionally large amount of analgesia becomes apparent upon a slight decrease in noxious heat stimulation ) .
METHODS	Twenty-four patients with diabetic polyneuropathy ( DPN ) were randomized to receive daily treatment with tapentadol sustained-release ( SR ) -LSB- average daily dose @ ( @ ) mg -RSB- or placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	CPM and OA were measured before and on the last day of treatment .
RESULTS	Before treatment , none of the patients had significant CPM or OA responses .
RESULTS	At week @ of treatment , CPM was significantly activated by tapentadol SR and coincided with significant analgesic responses .
RESULTS	CPM increased from @ ( @ ) % ( baseline ) to @ ( @ ) % ( placebo ) and @ ( @ ) % ( tapentadol SR , P < @ vs placebo ) ; relief of DPN pain was also greater in patients treated with tapentadol than placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Neither placebo nor tapentadol SR treatment had an effect on the magnitude of the OA responses ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Tapentadol 's analgesic effect in chronic pain patients with DPN is dependent on activation of descending inhibitory pain pathways as observed by CPM responses .

OBJECTIVE	To characterize the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and dose proportionality of mipomersen after single subcutaneous ( SC ) administration to Japanese healthy subjects ; and to compare the PK profiles of Japanese and Western subjects .
METHODS	@ healthy first-generation Japanese male subjects were enrolled into one of three treatment cohorts ( @ , @ and @ mg SC ) in a dose-escalation design .
METHODS	Within each cohort , subjects were randomized in a @ : @ ratio to receive mipomersen or placebo .
RESULTS	Mipomersen was absorbed rapidly after SC administration ; median tmax varied between @ and @ hours .
RESULTS	After reaching peak levels , plasma concentrations of mipomersen decayed multiphasically with an initial distribution t@/@ in several hours and a terminal t@/@ of @ - @ hours .
RESULTS	Mean Cmax increased in a dose-linear manner while all mean AUC from time @ to different cut points increased slightly more than dose proportionally .
RESULTS	Although mean terminal t@/@ varied in the dose range tested , it did not show dose-dependence .
RESULTS	The PK profiles of mipomersen in Japanese subjects are similar to those observed in Western subjects .
RESULTS	A single SC dose of @ mg , @ mg and @ mg mipomersen was well tolerated by male Japanese subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Single SC doses of @ - @ mg were safe and well tolerated when administered to Japanese subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Comparison of PK between Japanese and Western subjects does not support any need for dose adjustment in Japanese population in future clinical development .

BACKGROUND	The granisetron transdermal system ( GTS ) showed non-inferior efficacy to oral granisetron to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) during multiday chemotherapy .
BACKGROUND	We compared the efficacy and safety of GTS with that of intravenous and oral granisetron in Korean patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients were randomized into GTS ( n = @ , one patch on days @-@ ) or control group ( n = @ , intravenous on day @ and oral on days @-@ ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving complete response ( CR ) from chemotherapy initiation until @ h after the final administration .
RESULTS	Out of @ patients ( @ in GTS and @ in control group ) included in the per protocol analysis , @ % had gastrointestinal cancer and @ % received @-day chemotherapy .
RESULTS	The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy achieving CR in @ % of the patients ; @ % of the patients in the control group achieved CR ( @ % confidence interval -@ to @ % ) .
RESULTS	The CR rate did not change after subgroup analyses by sex , age , and chemotherapy naivety and analysis per day and overall days of treatment .
RESULTS	The GTS group showed sustained CR from day @ to day @ .
RESULTS	Patients ' satisfaction , assessed using Functional Living Index-Emesis ( FLI-E ) , showed no difference .
RESULTS	Both treatments were well tolerated and safe .
CONCLUSIONS	The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy to intravenous and oral granisetron .
CONCLUSIONS	The safety , tolerability , and FLI-E scores of the GTS were comparable to those of control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The GTS offers a convenient alternative option for relieving CINV in patients receiving MEC .

BACKGROUND	The Creighton Model FertilityCare System ( CrMS ) teaches women to identify days when intercourse is likely to result in pregnancy .
BACKGROUND	We sought to assess the impact of the CrMS on time to pregnancy ( TTP ) , via per-cycle pregnancy rates ( fecundability ) .
METHODS	We conducted a parallel randomised trial at the University of Utah School of Medicine , @-@ .
METHODS	Women ages @-@ years , in a relationship of proven fertility , who desired to conceive , were block-randomised and stratified for age , with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes .
METHODS	The control group received the advice to have intercourse @-@ times per week , and the intervention group received CrMS instruction .
METHODS	All women were asked to begin trying to conceive starting the second cycle in the study and were followed actively up to seven cycles , without blinding of research personnel .
METHODS	We calculated descriptive statistics and fecundability , and estimated Cox models for TTP .
METHODS	( Clinicaltrials.gov NCT@ ) .
RESULTS	There were @ women randomised : @ to the control group ( all analysed ) and @ to the CrMS group ( @ analysed ) .
RESULTS	The adjusted hazard ratio for the influence of CrMS on TTP was @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ , @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Fecundability in cycles with intent to conceive was @ % in controls and @ % with CrMS ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	By the first cycle , fecundability was @ % in controls , and @ % with CrMS ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No adverse events were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no significant impact of CrMS on TTP or fecundability , but fewer of the women receiving CrMS conceived by the first cycle .

BACKGROUND	Migraine is a highly disabling disease affecting a significant proportion of the Australian population .
BACKGROUND	The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) C@T variant has been associated with increased levels of homocysteine and risk of migraine with aura ( MA ) .
BACKGROUND	Folic acid ( FA ) , vitamin B@ , and B@ supplementation has been previously shown to reduce increased levels of homocysteine and decrease migraine symptoms .
BACKGROUND	However , the influence of dietary folate intake on migraine has been unclear .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the current study was to analyze the association of dietary folate intake in the form of dietary folate equivalent , FA , and total food folate ( TFF ) on migraine frequency , severity , and disability .
METHODS	A cohort of @ adult females of Caucasian descent with MA was genotyped for the MTHFR C@T variant using restriction enzyme digestion .
METHODS	Dietary folate information was collected from all participants and analyzed using the `` FoodWorks '' @ package .
METHODS	Folate consumption was compared with migraine frequency , severity , and disability using linear regression .
RESULTS	A significant inverse relation was observed between dietary folate equivalent ( R ( @ ) = @ , B = -@ , P = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- -LSB- -@ , -@ -RSB- ) and FA ( R ( @ ) = @ , B = -@ , P = @ , @ % CI -LSB- -@ , -@ -RSB- ) consumption and migraine frequency .
RESULTS	It was also observed that in individuals with the CC genotype for the MTHFR C@T variant , migraine frequency was significantly linked to FA consumption ( R ( @ ) = @ , B = -@ , P = @ , @ % CI -LSB- -@ , -@ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results from this study indicate that folate intake in the form of FA may influence migraine frequency in female MA sufferers .

BACKGROUND	Electronic monitoring is recommended for accurate measurement of medication adherence but a possible limitation is that it may influence adherence .
OBJECTIVE	To test the reactive effect of electronic monitoring in a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	A total of @ adults with type @ diabetes and HbA@c @mmol/mol were randomized to receiving their main oral glucose lowering medication in electronic containers or standard packaging .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were self-reported adherence measured with the MARS ( Medication Adherence Report Scale ; range @-@ ) and HbA@c at @weeks .
RESULTS	Non-significantly higher adherence and lower HbA@c were observed in the electronic container group ( differences in means , adjusting for baseline value : MARS , @ -LSB- @ % CI -@ to @ , p = @ -RSB- ; HbA@c ( mmol/mol ) , -@ -LSB- -@ to @ , p = @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Electronic containers may lead to a small increase in adherence but this potential limitation is outweighed by their advantages .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings support electronic monitoring as the method of choice in research on medication adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	( Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCT N@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	High levels of fibroblast growth factor @ are associated with accelerated progression of CKD .
OBJECTIVE	Whether high fibroblast growth factor @ levels also predict incident CKD is uncertain .
METHODS	A prospective case-cohort study was conducted within the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Trial .
METHODS	The analytic sample consisted of a random subcohort of @ patients with type @ diabetes without prevalent CKD at baseline , @ of whom developed incident CKD during follow-up , and @ additional patients with incident CKD outside the random subcohort .
METHODS	The association between serum intact fibroblast growth factor @ and incident CKD , defined as the new onset of eGFR < @ ml/min per @ m ( @ ) that represented a @ % decrease from baseline in an individual with eGFR@ ml/min per @ m ( @ ) and no microalbuminuria ( < @ mg/g creatinine ) at baseline , was tested .
RESULTS	The mean baseline eGFR in the random subcohort was @ ml/min per @ m ( @ ) .
RESULTS	During a median follow-up of @ years , there was a total of @ patients with incident CKD .
RESULTS	The median baseline fibroblast growth factor @ level was modestly higher among patients with incident CKD versus controls ( @ , interquartile range = @-@ @ versus @ , interquartile range = @-@ @ pg/ml ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Higher baseline fibroblast growth factor @ levels were associated with higher risk of incident CKD in unadjusted and demographics-adjusted models , but the effect was attenuated after additional adjustment for clinical risk factors and baseline eGFR ( hazard ratio per SD of natural log fibroblast growth factor @ , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ) , which was the strongest predictor of incident CKD .
RESULTS	Consistent with the results of primary analyses , baseline fibroblast growth factor @ was not associated with eGFR slope .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher fibroblast growth factor @ levels are not independently associated with higher risk of incident CKD in patients with type @ diabetes .

BACKGROUND	Many commencing junior doctors worldwide feel ill-prepared to deal with their new responsibilities , particularly prescribing .
BACKGROUND	Simulation has been widely utilised in medical education , but the use of extended multi-method simulation to emulate the junior doctor experience has rarely been reported .
METHODS	A randomised controlled trial compared students who underwent two , week-long , extended simulations , several months apart ( Intervention ) , with students who attended related workshops and seminars alone ( Control ) , for a range of outcome measures .
RESULTS	Eighty-four third year students in a graduate-entry medical program were randomised , and @ completed the study .
RESULTS	At the end of the first week , Intervention students scored a mean of @ % on a prescribing test , compared with @ % for Control students ( P = @ ) and Intervention teams initiated cardiac compressions a mean of @ seconds into a resuscitation test scenario , compared with @ seconds for Control teams ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At the beginning of the second week , an average of nine months later , a significant difference was maintained in relation to the prescribing test only ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At the end of the second week , significant Intervention vs Control differences were seen on knowledge and reasoning tests , a further prescribing test ( @ % vs @ % -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) and a paediatric resuscitation scenario test ( @ seconds to initiation of fluid resuscitation vs @ seconds -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The study demonstrated long-term retention of improved prescribing skills , and an immediate effect on knowledge acquisition , reasoning and resuscitation skills , from contextualising learning activities through extended multi-method simulation .

BACKGROUND	Regular exercise is an effective intervention to decrease blood pressure ( BP ) in hypertension , but no data are available concerning the effects of heated water-based exercise ( HEx ) .
BACKGROUND	This study examines the effects of HEx on BP in resistant hypertensive patients .
METHODS	This is a parallel , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	@ nonconsecutive sedentary patients with resistant hypertension from a hypertension outpatient clinic in a university hospital were screened ; @ patients fulfilled the study requirements .
METHODS	The training was performed for @-minute sessions in a heated pool ( @C ) , three times a week for @ weeks .
METHODS	The HEx protocol consisted of callisthenic exercises and walking inside the pool .
METHODS	The control group was asked to maintain habitual activities .
METHODS	The main outcome measure was change in mean @-hour ambulatory BP ( ABPM ) .
RESULTS	@ patients ( HEx n = @ ; control n = @ ) were randomized ; none were lost to follow-up .
RESULTS	Office BPs decreased significantly after heated water exercise ( @/@ mmHg ) .
RESULTS	HEx decreased @-hour systolic ( from @ to @ mmHg , p = @ ) and diastolic BPs ( from @ to @ mmHg , p = @ ) ; daytime systolic ( from @ to @ mmHg , p < @ ) and diastolic BPs ( from @ to @ mmHg , p = @ ) ; and nighttime systolic ( from @ to @ mmHg , p = @ ) and diastolic BPs ( from @ to @ mmHg , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The control group after @ weeks significantly increased in @-hour systolic and diastolic BPs , and daytime and nighttime diastolic BPs .
CONCLUSIONS	HEx reduced office BPs and @-hour ABPM levels in resistant hypertensive patients .
CONCLUSIONS	These effects suggest that HEx may be a potential new therapeutic approach in these patients .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether standardised cigarette packaging increases the time spent looking at health warnings , regardless of the format of those warnings .
METHODS	A factorial ( two pack styles x three warning types ) within-subject experiment , with participants randomised to different orders of conditions , completed at a university in London , UK .
METHODS	Mock-ups of cigarette packets were presented to participants with their branded portion in either standardised ( plain ) or manufacturer-designed ( branded ) format .
METHODS	Health warnings were present on all packets , representing all three types currently in use in the UK : black & white text , colour text , or colour images with accompanying text .
METHODS	Gaze position was recorded using a specialised eye tracker , providing the main outcome measure , which was the mean proportion of a five-second viewing period spent gazing at the warning-label region of the packet .
RESULTS	An opportunity sample of @ ( six male , mean age = @ ) young adults met the following inclusion criteria : @ ) not currently a smoker ; @ ) < @ lifetime cigarettes smoked ; @ ) gaze position successfully tracked for > @ % viewing time .
RESULTS	These participants spent a greater proportion of the available time gazing at the warning-label region when the branded section of the pack was standardised ( following current Australian guidelines ) rather than containing the manufacturer 's preferred design ( mean difference in proportions = @ , @ % confidence interval @ to @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no evidence that this effect varied based on the type of warning label ( black & white text vs. colour text vs. colour image & text ; interaction p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	During incidental viewing of cigarette packets , young adult never-smokers are likely to spend more time looking at health warnings if manufacturers are compelled to use standardised packaging , regardless of the warning design .

BACKGROUND	Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome ( BHD ) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the occurrence of benign , mostly facial , skin tumours called fibrofolliculomas , multiple lung cysts , spontaneous pneumothorax and an increased renal cancer risk .
BACKGROUND	Current treatments for fibrofolliculomas have high rates of recurrence and carry a risk of complications .
BACKGROUND	It would be desirable to have a treatment that could prevent fibrofolliculomas from growing .
BACKGROUND	Animal models of BHD have previously shown deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) .
BACKGROUND	Topical use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is an effective treatment for the skin tumours ( angiofibromas ) in tuberous sclerosis complex , which is also characterised by mTOR deregulation .
BACKGROUND	In this study we aimed to determine if topical rapamycin is also an effective treatment for fibrofolliculomas in BHD. .
METHODS	We performed a double blinded , randomised , facial left-right controlled trial of topical rapamycin @ % versus placebo in @ BHD patients .
METHODS	Trial duration was @ months .
METHODS	The primary outcome was cosmetic improvement as measured by doctors and patients .
METHODS	Changes in fibrofolliculoma number and size were also measured , as was occurrence of side effects .
RESULTS	No change in cosmetic status of fibrofolliculomas was reported in the majority of cases for the rapamycin treated ( @ % by doctors , @ % by patients ) as well as the placebo treated facial sides ( both @ % ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences between rapamycin and placebo treated facial halves were observed ( p = @ for doctors opinion , p = @ for patients opinion ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference in fibrofolliculoma number or change in size of the fibrofolliculomas was seen after @ months .
RESULTS	Side effects occurred more often after rapamycin treatment ( @ % of patients ) than after placebo ( @ % of patients ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	A burning sensation , erythema , itching and dryness were most frequently reported .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides no evidence that treatment of fibrofolliculomas with topical rapamycin in BHD results in cosmetic improvement .

BACKGROUND	Accurately estimating the period of time that individuals are exposed to online intervention content is important for understanding program engagement .
BACKGROUND	This can be calculated from time-stamped data reflecting navigation to and from individual webpages .
BACKGROUND	Prolonged periods of inactivity are commonly handled with a time-out feature and assigned a prespecified exposure duration .
BACKGROUND	Unfortunately , this practice can lead to biased results describing program exposure .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to describe how multiple imputations can be used to better account for the time spent viewing webpages that result in a prolonged period of inactivity or a time-out .
METHODS	To illustrate this method , we present data on time-outs collected from the Q ( @ ) randomized smoking cessation trial .
METHODS	For this analysis , we evaluate the effects on intervention exposure of receiving content written in a prescriptive versus motivational tone .
METHODS	Using multiple imputations , we created five complete datasets in which the time spent viewing webpages that resulted in a time-out were replaced with values estimated with imputation models .
METHODS	We calculated standard errors using Rubin 's formulas to account for the variability due to the imputations .
METHODS	We also illustrate how current methods of accounting for time-outs ( excluding timed-out page views or assigning an arbitrary viewing time ) can influence conclusions about participant engagement .
RESULTS	A total of @ % ( @/@ ) of participants accessed the online intervention in the Q ( @ ) trial .
RESULTS	Of the @ unique page views , @ ( @ % , @/@ ) resulted in a time-out .
RESULTS	The median time spent viewing webpages that did not result in a time-out was @ minutes .
RESULTS	Assuming participants did not spend any time viewing a webpage that resulted in a time-out , no difference between the two message tones was observed ( ratio of mean time online : @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Assigning @ minutes of viewing time to all page views that resulted in a time-out concludes that participants who received content in a motivational tone spent less time viewing content ( ratio of mean time online : @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) than those participants who received content in a prescriptive tone .
RESULTS	Using multiple imputations to account for time-outs concludes that there is no difference in participant engagement between the two message tones ( ratio of mean time online : @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The analytic technique chosen can significantly affect conclusions about online intervention engagement .
CONCLUSIONS	We propose a standardized methodology in which time spent viewing webpages that result in a time-out is treated as missing information and corrected with multiple imputations .

OBJECTIVE	Little is known about the effects of natural mineral water on constipation in adults .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed the effect of a magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral water ( Hpar ; Nestl Waters , Issy-les-Moulineaux , France ) on gastrointestinal transit in constipated women .
METHODS	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hpar in outpatients with functional constipation ( based on the Rome III criteria ) .
METHODS	The study included @ female patients , age @ to @ years , identified by @ general practitioners throughout France .
METHODS	After a washout period , subjects drank @ L natural low-mineral water daily ( control , n = @ ) , @ L Hpar and @ L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar @ group , n = @ ) , or @ L Hpar and @ L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar @ group , n = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	We collected information on the number and types of stools , abdominal pain , rescue medications , adverse events , and volume of water consumed .
RESULTS	We observed no significant effect at week @ .
RESULTS	At week @ , constipation was reduced in @ % of patients in the control group , in @ % in the Hpar @ group ( P = @ vs controls ) , and in @ % in the Hpar @ group ( P = @ vs controls ) .
RESULTS	The Hpar @ group also had a decreased number of hard or lumpy stools ( Bristol scale , P = @ vs baseline ) and a substantial decrease in the use of rescue medication ( P = @ vs controls ) .
RESULTS	Patient responses correlated with magnesium sulfate concentrations .
RESULTS	Safety was very good ; there were no serious adverse events among patients who drank Hpar .
CONCLUSIONS	In a controlled trial , daily consumption of @ L Hpar reduced constipation and hard or lumpy stools in a greater percentage of women with functional constipation than natural low-mineral water , as early as the second week of treatment .

OBJECTIVE	Cutaneous telangiectases are a characteristic and psychologically distressing feature of SSc .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to assess the efficacy of two light-based treatments : pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) and intense pulsed light ( IPL ) .
METHODS	Nineteen patients with facial or upper limb telangiectases underwent three treatments with PDL and IPL ( randomly assigned to left - and right-sided lesions ) .
METHODS	Outcome measures were clinical photography ( assessed by two clinicians ) , dermoscopy ( assessed by two observers ) , laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) and observer and patient opinion , including patient self-assessment psychological questionnaires -LSB- Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Adapted Satisfaction with Appearance Scale ( ASWAP ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	Comparison between @-week follow-up and baseline photography scores ( from -@ to +@ on a Likert scale , with > @ being improvement ) were a mean score for PDL of @ ( @ % CI @ , @ ) and for IPL @ ( @ , @ ) , with a mean difference between PDL and IPL of -@ ( -@ , -@ ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Dermoscopy scores also improved with both therapies : PDL @ ( @ , @ ) and IPL @ ( @ , @ ) , again greater with PDL ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	LDI showed decreases in blood flow at @ weeks , indicating a response to both therapies .
RESULTS	All patients reported benefit from treatment ( more preferred PDL at @ weeks ) .
RESULTS	Psychological questionnaires also indicated improvement after therapy with mean change in ASWAP of -@ ( @ % CI -@ , -@ ) .
RESULTS	No side effects were reported for IPL ; PDL caused transient bruising in most cases .
CONCLUSIONS	Both PDL and IPL are effective treatments for SSc-related telangiectases .
CONCLUSIONS	Outcome measures indicate that PDL has better outcomes in terms of appearance , although IPL had fewer side effects .

RESULTS	At month @ , HIV-DNA loads were similar between groups ( @ -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- log per @ ( @ ) PBMC in the intensive cART group vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the standard cART group ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Eight grade @-@ clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the intensive cART group and seven grade @-@ clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the standard cART group .
RESULTS	Three serious clinical adverse events occurred : two ( pancreatitis and lipodystrophy ) in the standard cART group , which were regarded as treatment related , and one event ( suicide attempt ) in the intensive cART group that was unrelated to treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	After @ months , cART intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc did not have a greater effect on HIV blood reservoirs than did standard cART .
CONCLUSIONS	These results should help to design future trials of treatments aiming to decrease the HIV reservoir in patients with primary HIV-@ infection .

OBJECTIVE	To test the effects of pregabalin on the induction of neurogenic claudication .
METHODS	This study was a randomized , double-blind , active placebo-controlled , @-period , crossover trial .
METHODS	Twenty-nine subjects were randomized to receive pregabalin followed by active placebo ( i.e. , diphenhydramine ) or active placebo followed by pregabalin .
METHODS	Each treatment period lasted @ days , including a @-step titration .
METHODS	Periods were separated by a @-day washout period , including a @-day taper phase after the first period .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was the time to first moderate pain symptom ( Numeric Rating Scale score @ ) during a @-minute treadmill test ( Tfirst ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included pain intensity at rest , pain intensity at the end of the treadmill test , distance walked , and validated self-report measures of pain and functional limitation including the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire , modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form , Oswestry Disability Index , and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found between pregabalin and active placebo for the time to first moderate pain symptom ( difference in median Tfirst = -@ -LSB- @ % confidence interval -@ to @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , none of the secondary outcome measures of pain or functional limitation were significantly improved by pregabalin compared with active placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Pregabalin was not more effective than active placebo in reducing painful symptoms or functional limitations in patients with neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis .
METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with neurogenic claudication , compared with diphenhydramine , pregabalin does not increase the time to moderate pain during a treadmill test .

OBJECTIVE	A phase @ study was conducted to evaluate the bioavailability and food effect of a new veliparib formulation in subjects with solid tumors .
METHODS	Subjects ( planned : Stage I , N = @ ; Stage II , N = @ ) received four regimens of a single oral dose of veliparib utilizing a group-sequential design .
METHODS	Subjects were administered single doses of @ mg veliparib supplied as four @ mg current formulation , four @ mg new formulation and one @ mg new formulation under fasting conditions and under non-fasting conditions .
METHODS	Serial blood samples were collected for the determination of veliparib pharmacokinetics .
METHODS	At the end of Stage I , the relative bioavailability between each pair of regimens was assessed by a two one-sided tests procedure from the analyses of the natural logarithms of C ( max ) and AUC .
METHODS	A @ % confidence interval within the @-@ @ range between each regimen pair determined bioequivalence .
RESULTS	Four @ mg current formulation capsules , four @ mg new formulation and one @ mg new formulation were bioequivalent with respect to C ( max ) and AUC under fasting conditions .
RESULTS	The administration of a high-fat meal did not have a significant effect on AUC and only caused a slight decrease in veliparib C ( max ) ( @ % ) and a delay of approximately @ h in T ( max ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The @ mg new capsule was bioequivalent to currently used formulation .
CONCLUSIONS	Food had no effect on the extent of veliparib absorption and only a small ( @ % ) decrease in peak exposure of veliparib .

BACKGROUND	Renin-angiotensin system inhibition ( RASI ) is frequently avoided in aortic stenosis ( AS ) patients because of fear of hypotension .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated if RASI with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) increased mortality in patients with mild to moderate AS .
METHODS	All patients ( n = @ ) from the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis study : asymptomatic patients with AS and preserved left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction were included .
METHODS	Risks of sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality according to RASI treatment were analyzed by multivariable time-varying Cox models and propensity score matched analyses .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients received RASI .
RESULTS	During a median follow-up of @ @ years , @ patients were categorized as having severe AS , @ underwent aortic valve replacement , @ SCDs , @ cardiovascular and @ all-cause deaths occurred .
RESULTS	RASI was not associated with SCD ( HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) , cardiovascular ( HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) or all-cause mortality ( HR : @ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	This was confirmed in propensity matched analysis ( all p > @ ) .
RESULTS	In separate analyses , RASI was associated with larger reduction in systolic blood pressure ( p = @ ) and less progression of LV mass ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	RASI was not associated with SCD , cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in asymptomatic AS patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , RASI was associated with a potentially beneficial decrease in blood pressure and reduced LV mass progression .

BACKGROUND	Exercise capacity is a strong predictor of survival in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
BACKGROUND	Exercise capacity improves after cardiac rehabilitation exercise training , but previous studies have demonstrated a decline in peak oxygen uptake after ending a formal rehabilitation program .
BACKGROUND	There is a lack of knowledge on how long-term exercise adherence can be achieved in CAD patients .
BACKGROUND	We therefore assessed if a @-month maintenance program following cardiac rehabilitation would lead to increased adherence to exercise and increased exercise capacity compared to usual care .
METHODS	Two-centre , open , parallel randomized controlled trial with @ months follow-up comparing usual care to a maintenance program .
METHODS	The maintenance program consisted of one monthly supervised high intensity interval training session , a written exercise program and exercise diary , and a maximum exercise test every third month during follow-up .
METHODS	Forty-nine patients ( @ women ) on optimal medical treatment were included following discharge from cardiac rehabilitation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was change in peak oxygen uptake at follow-up ; secondary endpoints were physical activity level , quality of life and blood markers of cardiovascular risk .
RESULTS	There was no change in peak oxygen uptake from baseline to follow-up in either group ( intervention group @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) mLkg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) , control group @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) mLkg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) , with no between-group difference , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Quality of life and blood biomarkers remained essentially unchanged , and both self-reported and measured physical activity levels were similar between groups after @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	A maintenance exercise program for @ months did not improve adherence to exercise or peak oxygen uptake in CAD patients after discharge from cardiac rehabilitation compared to usual care .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that infrequent supervised high intensity interval training sessions are inadequate to improve peak oxygen uptake in this patient group .

BACKGROUND	Early , goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) is recommended in international guidelines for the resuscitation of patients presenting with early septic shock .
BACKGROUND	However , adoption has been limited , and uncertainty about its effectiveness remains .
METHODS	We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with an integrated cost-effectiveness analysis in @ hospitals in England .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either EGDT ( a @-hour resuscitation protocol ) or usual care .
METHODS	The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at @ days .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ patients , with @ assigned to EGDT and @ to usual care .
RESULTS	By @ days , @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the EGDT group and @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the usual-care group had died ( relative risk in the EGDT group , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ) , for an absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of -@ percentage points ( @ % CI , -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by increased use of intravenous fluids , vasoactive drugs , and red-cell transfusions and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores , more days receiving advanced cardiovascular support , and longer stays in the intensive care unit .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes , including health-related quality of life , or in rates of serious adverse events .
RESULTS	On average , EGDT increased costs , and the probability that it was cost-effective was below @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation , hemodynamic management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in outcome .

OBJECTIVE	To identify characteristics of hemodialysis patients most likely to experience difficulty adhering to sodium restrictions associated with their dietary regimen .
METHODS	Secondary analysis using baseline data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial examining the effects of a technology-supported behavioral intervention on dietary sodium intake in hemodialysis patients .
METHODS	Thirteen dialysis centers in southwestern Pennsylvania .
METHODS	We included @ participants ( @ % women ; @ % African American ) aged @ @ years undergoing maintenance , intermittent hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease .
METHODS	Normalized dietary sodium intake , adjusted interdialytic weight gain , perceived problems , and self-efficacy for restricting dietary sodium .
RESULTS	Younger participants were more likely to report problems managing their hemodialysis diet and low self-efficacy for restricting sodium intake .
RESULTS	Consistent with these findings , younger participants had a higher median sodium intake and higher average adjusted interdialytic weight gain .
RESULTS	Females reported more problems managing their diet .
RESULTS	Race , time on dialysis , and perceived income adequacy did not seem to influence outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that patients who are younger and female encounter more difficulty adhering to the hemodialysis regimen .
CONCLUSIONS	Hence , there may be a need to individualize counseling and interventions for these individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	Further investigation is needed to understand the independent effects of age and gender on adherence to hemodialysis dietary recommendations and perceived self-efficacy .

BACKGROUND	Ventricular and supraventricular premature complexes ( PC ) are frequent and usually symptomatic .
BACKGROUND	According to a previous study , magnesium pidolate ( MgP ) administration to symptomatic patients can improve the PC density and symptoms .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the late follow-up of that clinical intervention in patients treated with MgP or placebo .
METHODS	In the first phase of the study , @ symptomatic and consecutive patients with PC were randomized ( double-blind ) to receive either MgP or placebo for @ days .
METHODS	Monthly follow-up visits were conducted for @ months to assess symptoms and control electrolytes .
METHODS	@-hour Holter was performed twice , regardless of symptoms , or whenever symptoms were present .
METHODS	In the second phase of the study , relapsing patients , who had received MgP or placebo ( crossing-over ) in the first phase , were treated with MgP according to the same protocol .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients initially treated with MgP , @ ( @ % ) relapsed during the @-month follow-up , and the relapse time varied .
RESULTS	Relapsing patients treated again had a statistically significant reduction in the PC density of @ / hour ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The crossing-over patients reduced it by @/hour ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients who did not relapse , had a low PC frequency ( @ PC/hour ) .
RESULTS	Retreated patients had a @ % improvement in symptom , and crossing-over patients , @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Some patients on MgP had relapse of symptoms and PC , indicating that MgP is neither a definitive nor a curative treatment for late follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	However , improvement in the PC frequency and symptoms was observed in the second phase of treatment , similar to the response in the first phase of treatment .

BACKGROUND	Value of information analysis has been proposed as an alternative to the standard hypothesis testing approach , which is based on type I and type II errors , in determining sample sizes for randomized clinical trials .
BACKGROUND	However , in addition to sample size calculation , value of information analysis can optimize other aspects of research design such as possible comparator arms and alternative follow-up times , by considering trial designs that maximize the expected net benefit of research , which is the difference between the expected cost of the trial and the expected value of additional information .
OBJECTIVE	To apply value of information methods to the results of a pilot study on catheter securement devices to determine the optimal design of a future larger clinical trial .
METHODS	An economic evaluation was performed using data from a multi-arm randomized controlled pilot study comparing the efficacy of four types of catheter securement devices : standard polyurethane , tissue adhesive , bordered polyurethane and sutureless securement device .
METHODS	Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation was used to characterize uncertainty surrounding the study results and to calculate the expected value of additional information .
METHODS	To guide the optimal future trial design , the expected costs and benefits of the alternative trial designs were estimated and compared .
RESULTS	Analysis of the value of further information indicated that a randomized controlled trial on catheter securement devices is potentially worthwhile .
RESULTS	Among the possible designs for the future trial , a four-arm study with @ patients/arm would provide the highest expected net benefit corresponding to @ % return-on-investment .
RESULTS	The initially considered design of @ patients/arm , based on hypothesis testing calculations , would provide lower net benefit with return-on-investment of @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses were based on the data from a single pilot trial which might affect the accuracy of our uncertainty estimation .
CONCLUSIONS	Another limitation was that different follow-up durations for the larger trial were not evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	The value of information approach allows efficient trial design by maximizing the expected net benefit of additional research .
CONCLUSIONS	This approach should be considered early in the design of randomized clinical trials .

OBJECTIVE	To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two different tooth replacement strategies for partially dentate older patients , namely partial removable dental prostheses ( RDP ) and functionally orientated treatment based on the shortened dental arch concept ( SDA ) .
METHODS	Ninety-two partially dentate older patients completed a randomized controlled clinical trial .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups : the RDP group and the SDA group .
METHODS	Treatment effect was measured using impact on oral health-related quality of life ( OHrQOL ) , and the costs involved in providing and maintaining care were recorded for all patients .
METHODS	Patients were followed for @ months after treatment intervention .
METHODS	All treatment was provided by a single operator .
RESULTS	The total cost of achieving the minimally important clinical difference ( MID ) in OHrQOL for an average patient in the RDP group was @ .
RESULTS	For the SDA group , the cost of achieving the MID for an average patient was @ .
RESULTS	The cost-effectiveness ratio was therefore @:@ in favour of SDA treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	With an increasingly ageing population , many patients will continue to benefit from removable prostheses to replace their missing natural teeth .
CONCLUSIONS	From a purely economic standpoint , the results from this analysis suggest that the treatment of partially dentate older adults should be focused on functionally orientated treatment because it is simply more cost-effective .

BACKGROUND	Previous reports suggest that adherence to patching is a major issue in amblyopia treatment .
BACKGROUND	We tested with an unmasked randomised controlled clinical trial whether an intense educational/motivational intervention improves adherence when a high-dose regime is prescribed .
METHODS	@ children with newly diagnosed amblyopia were randomly allocated into two treatment arms with and without educational/motivational intervention material .
METHODS	Both were prescribed patching @ h/day , @ days/week for a fixed period of @ weeks .
METHODS	The intervention arm received an educational/motivational intervention before patching which included information booklets , video , a cartoon story book , sticker charts and a dedicated session with a researcher .
METHODS	The control arm received the usual clinical information .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was adherence measured using electronic occlusion dose monitors where a success/failure binary outcome was used to account for participants who dropped out of the study defined as patching > @ h/day .
METHODS	Visual outcome , expressed as percentage visual deficit , was measured as secondary outcome .
RESULTS	The intervention increased adherence success rate from @ % in the control group to @ % in the intervention group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , visual outcome was not significantly better in the intervention group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study shows that an intense educational/motivational intervention can improve adherence to patching to high prescribed doses although no significant improvement in visual outcome was observed .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy using dienogest and medroxyprogesterone acetate on psychological symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .
METHODS	A total of @ patients who sought treatment at the menopause units of the authors ' gynecology and obstetrics clinics between of November @ and October @ complaining of vasomotor symptoms were included in the study prospectively .
METHODS	The cases were divided into two groups : Group I ( @ patients ) was given @ mg estradiol valerate and @ mg dienogest , and Group II ( @ patients ) was given @ mg estradiol valerate and @ mg medroxyprogesterone acetate .
METHODS	The groups ' results in months @ and @ were compared through the evaluation of vasomotor and psychological symptom levels .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found between the groups when the initial levels of vasomotor and psychological symptom subtypes were compared ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	It was observed that all the psychological symptoms decreased in the @th month in the group using dienogest in comparison with the initial situation , and that psychological symptoms increased in the group using medroxyprogesterone acetate in the evaluation performed in the @th month compared with the initial levels .
RESULTS	It was also found out that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups when compared in terms of these symptoms ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While the use of dienogest normalizes the general psychological situation and sleep , it was observed that the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) worsens the general psychological situation .

BACKGROUND	Cross-sectional and retrospective studies have associated major depressive disorder with glial activation and injury as well as blood-brain barrier disruption , but these associations have not been assessed prospectively .
BACKGROUND	Here , we aimed to determine the relationship between changes in depressive symptom severity and in blood levels of S-@ calcium-binding protein B ( S-@B ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , and interleukin-@ following an inflammatory challenge .
METHODS	Fifty unselected participants were recruited from a randomized , controlled trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures performed with versus without cardiopulmonary bypass for the risk of neurocognitive decline .
METHODS	Depressive symptom severity was measured at baseline , discharge , and six-month follow-up using the Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome of the present biomarker study was acute change in depressive symptom severity , defined as the intra-subject difference between baseline and discharge BDI-II scores .
METHODS	Blood biomarker levels were determined at baseline and @ days postoperative .
RESULTS	Changes in S-@B levels correlated positively with acute changes in depressive symptom severity ( Spearman , @ ; P = @ ) and accounted for about one-fourth of their observed variance ( R@ , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for baseline S-@B levels , age , weight , body-mass index , or - blocker use , but not baseline BDI-II scores ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant association between the primary outcome and baseline S-@B levels , baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-@ levels , or changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-@ levels .
RESULTS	Among most participants , levels of all three biomarkers were normal at baseline and markedly elevated at @ days postoperative .
CONCLUSIONS	Acute changes in depressive symptom severity were specifically associated with incremental changes in S-@B blood levels , largely independent of covariates associated with either .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support the hypothesis that glial activation and injury and blood-brain barrier disruption can be mechanistically linked to acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms in some individuals .

BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is associated with elevated ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) in subjects with high cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk despite medical management .
METHODS	Data from the baseline examination of the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment ( HeartBEAT ) study , a @-site randomized controlled trial were analyzed .
METHODS	Individuals with moderate-severe OSA ( apnea hypopnea index , AHI = @-@ ) and cardiovascular risk were recruited from cardiology practices .
METHODS	Those with hypertension were included .
METHODS	Intensive antihypertensive regimen ( IAR ) was defined as @ antihypertensives including a diuretic .
METHODS	Definitions were : controlled BP ( BP < @/@ ) , uncontrolled elevated BP ( BP @/@ not on IAR ) and resistant elevated BP ( BP @/@ mm Hg despite IAR ) .
METHODS	Associations of untreated severe OSA ( AHI @ ) and uncontrolled and resistant elevated BP were evaluated using logistic regression analyses adjusted for age , sex , race , body mass index , smoking status , diabetes , and CVD .
RESULTS	Among the @ participants ( mean age @ @ years , @ % with severe OSA ) , @ % had controlled BP , @ % had uncontrolled elevated BP , and @ % had resistant elevated BP .
RESULTS	Among participants prescribed IAR , resistant elevated BP was more prevalent in those with severe compared to moderate OSA ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Participants with severe OSA had a @-fold higher adjusted odds of resistant elevated BP ( OR @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ ) , a finding not reproduced in the absence of IAR use .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with increased cardiovascular risk and moderate to severe OSA , untreated severe compared to moderate OSA was associated with elevated BP despite IAR suggesting untreated severe OSA contributes to poor BP control despite aggressive medication use .
CONCLUSIONS	A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page @ .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of autologous transplantation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) - mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMNCs ) and Panax notoginseng saponins ( PNS ) in the treatment of unreconstructable critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) .
METHODS	We performed an open-label , parallel-group , single-center , randomized clinical trial in this study .
METHODS	A total of @ patients were enrolled and randomly divided into @ groups ( the PBMNC + PNS group and the PBMNC group ) in a @:@ ratio .
METHODS	Evaluation variables , including changes in the ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) of ischemic limbs , ulcer area , severity of rest pain , transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( T ( C ) PO@ ) , and @-min walk distance from baseline to week @ and @ , as well as angiographic scores for new collateral vessel formation at week @ , were used to compare the benefits of these @ treatment approaches .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of treatment , improvement in ABI , T ( C ) PO@ , and @-min walk distance was significantly better in the PBMNC + PNS group .
RESULTS	In addition , the combination of PBMNC transplantation and PNS administration yielded a greater reduction in ulcer area and severity of rest pain than did PBMNC transplantation alone .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar between both treatment groups .
RESULTS	Adverse events caused by PBMNC transplantation or PNS were generally mild and no serious adverse events occurred throughout the entire period of study .
CONCLUSIONS	A combination of PNS and PBMNC transplantation appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with unreconstructable CLI .
CONCLUSIONS	This combination may have great potential advantages in comparison with PBMNC transplantation alone and might constitute a novel therapeutic option for unreconstructable CLI .

BACKGROUND	Bone marrow ( BM ) dysfunction is common in severely injured trauma patients , resulting from elevated catecholamines and plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) as well as prolonged mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) .
BACKGROUND	We have previously shown that propranolol ( - blocker -LSB- BB -RSB- ) reduces HPC mobilization in a rodent model of injury and hemorrhagic shock .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that BB would prevent BM dysfunction in humans following severe injury .
METHODS	Forty-five severely injured trauma patients were studied in a prospective , randomized pilot trial .
METHODS	Twenty-five patients received BB , and @ served as untreated controls .
METHODS	The dose of propranolol was adjusted to decrease the heart rate by @ % to @ % from baseline .
METHODS	Blood was analyzed for the presence of HPC ( blast-forming unit erythroid cells -LSB- BFU-E -RSB- and colony-forming unit erythroid cells ) and G-CSF .
METHODS	Demographic data , Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) , hemoglobin , reticulocyte number , and outcome data were obtained .
RESULTS	The mean age of the study population was @ years ; @ % were male , with a mean ISS of @ .
RESULTS	There is a significant increase in BFU-E in peripheral blood immediately following traumatic injury , and this mobilization persists for @ days .
RESULTS	The use of BB significantly decreases BFU-E and colony-forming unit erythroid cells at all time points .
RESULTS	G-CSF is significantly elevated in both groups on admission ; the use of BB decreases G-CSF levels by @ % as compared with @ % for controls .
RESULTS	The average hemoglobin is nearly @ g higher on the day of discharge with propranolol treatment ( BB , @ @ g/dL vs. no BB , @ @ g/dL ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Following severe trauma , early treatment with propranolol following resuscitation is safe .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of propranolol blunts early tachycardia , reduces HPC mobilization , and results in a faster return to baseline of the G-CSF peak seen after injury .
CONCLUSIONS	There is also a trend toward faster recovery and resolution of anemia .
CONCLUSIONS	Propranolol may be the first therapeutic agent to show improved BM function after severe injury .
METHODS	Therapeutic study , level III .

BACKGROUND	Despite evidence for the effectiveness of structured psychological therapies for bipolar disorder no psychological interventions have been specifically designed to enhance personal recovery for individuals with recent-onset bipolar disorder .
OBJECTIVE	A pilot study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a new intervention , recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , designed in collaboration with individuals with recent-onset bipolar disorder intended to improve clinical and personal recovery outcomes .
METHODS	A single , blind randomised controlled trial compared treatment as usual ( TAU ) with recovery-focused CBT plus TAU ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Recruitment and follow-up rates within @ % of pre-planned targets to @-month follow-up were achieved .
RESULTS	An average of @ h ( s.d. = @ ) of recovery-focused CBT were attended out of a potential maximum of @ h. Compared with TAU , recovery-focused CBT significantly improved personal recovery up to @-month follow-up ( Bipolar Recovery Questionnaire mean score @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ( s.e. = @ ) , P = @ , d = @ ) and increased time to any mood relapse during up to @ months follow-up ( @ = @ , P < @ , estimated hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Groups did not differ with respect to medication adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	Recovery-focused CBT seems promising with respect to feasibility and potential clinical effectiveness .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical - and cost-effectiveness now need to be reliably estimated in a definitive trial .

OBJECTIVE	Tofacitinib is a novel , oral Janus kinase inhibitor being investigated for psoriasis .
OBJECTIVE	This study assessed the relationship between pruritus and clinical signs of psoriasis ( assessed by Physician 's Global Assessment -LSB- PGA -RSB- ) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis receiving tofacitinib .
METHODS	In this @-week ( @-week treatment period , @-week observation period ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase IIb study ( NCT@ ) , @ patients were randomized to tofacitinib @ , @ or @ mg BID , or placebo .
METHODS	Pruritus was patient assessed using the Itch Severity Score ( ISS ) , a @-@ ( @ = worst itching ) rating scale recorded daily from baseline to week @ and at study visits .
METHODS	Mediation modeling was used to determine relationships between ISS ( average score weeks @-@ ) , PGA ( average score weeks @-@ ) and treatment groups .
RESULTS	Mediation analysis showed that @-@ @ % ( p < @ versus placebo ) of tofacitinib 's effect on pruritus was direct , and mostly independent of improvements in erythema , induration and scaling .
RESULTS	ISS measurements had acceptable test-retest reliability .
RESULTS	Correlation analyses with clinical outcomes supported the validity of the ISS as a pruritus measure .
CONCLUSIONS	Tofacitinib has a direct , beneficial effect on patient-reported pruritus independent from improvements in clinician-reported psoriasis severity signs .
CONCLUSIONS	The ISS demonstrated favorable psychometric characteristics , supporting its use as a pruritus assessment tool .

OBJECTIVE	Animal-assisted therapy ( AAT ) , most frequently used with dogs , is being used increasingly as an adjunctive alternative treatment for psychiatric patients .
OBJECTIVE	AAT with larger animals , such as horses , may have unique benefits .
OBJECTIVE	In this randomized controlled study , equine and canine forms of AAT were compared with standard treatments for hospitalized psychiatric patients to determine AAT effects on violent behavior and related measures .
METHODS	The study included @ patients with recent in-hospital violent behavior or highly regressed behavior .
METHODS	Hospitalization at the @-bed state psychiatric hospital was two months or longer ( mean @ years ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomly selected to receive ten weekly group therapy sessions of standardized equine-assisted psychotherapy ( EAP ) , canine-assisted psychotherapy ( CAP ) , enhanced social skills psychotherapy , or regular hospital care .
METHODS	Participants ' mean age was @ , @ % were female , @ % had diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , and @ % had been committed involuntarily for civil or forensic reasons .
METHODS	Violence-related incident reports filed by staff in the three months after study intake were compared with reports two months preintake .
RESULTS	Interventions were well tolerated .
RESULTS	Analyses revealed an intervention group effect ( F = @ , df = @ and @ , p = @ ) ; post hoc tests showed specific benefits of EAP ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similar AAT effects were found for the incidence of @:@ clinical observation ( F = @ , df = @ and @ , p = @ ) ; post hoc tests suggested benefits of CAP ( p = @ ) as well as EAP ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Covariance analyses indicated that staff can predict which patients are likely to benefit from EAP ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	AAT , and perhaps EAP uniquely , may be an effective therapeutic modality for long-term psychiatric patients at risk of violence .

OBJECTIVE	Knowledge about the inhibition of centrally located angiotensin-I ( AT-I ) receptors by highly lipophilic AT-I receptor blockers and its ' effect are limited with experimental studies .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , we aimed to investigate the effect of Telmisartan on Inter-dialytic weight gain ( IDWG ) % and echocardiographic measurements in anuric hemodialysis ( HD ) patients .
METHODS	A total of forty-one anuric HD patients with @ months maintenance on HD were included in this prospective , randomized and self-controlled study .
METHODS	Four weeks prior the study , angiotensin converting enzyme blockers and AT-I receptor blocker drugs were stopped .
METHODS	Patients were assessed three times during the study protocol .
METHODS	These are baseline , three months later ( without Telmisartan period ) and three months after Telmisartan therapy .
RESULTS	IDWG % was significantly decreased in the period of with Telmisartan compared to period without Telmisartan ( @ @ % vs @ @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	After the administration of Telmisartan left ventricule end-diastolic diameter ( LVEDD ) ( p = @ ) and inferior vena cava diameter ( IVCD ) ( @ @ mm vs @ @ mm , p = @ ) were significantly decreased compared to the period of without Telmisartan .
RESULTS	Despite of significantly changes observed in IVCD and LVEDD measurements in a period without Telmisartan , there was no significantly difference in left ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) measurements in this period .
RESULTS	However , LVMI was significantly regressed after the administration of Telmisartan ( @ @ g vs @ @ g , p = @ respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment of anuric HD patients with Telmisartan at a dose of @ mg a day reduces IDWG % , LVEDD and IVCD measurements .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies investigating the long-term effect of these beneficial effects on clinical outcomes are necessary .

BACKGROUND	There are currently no serum biomarkers capable of distinguishing elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) that portend serious liver injury potential from benign elevations such as those occurring during cholestyramine treatment .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that newly proposed biomarkers of hepatotoxicity would not significantly rise in serum during elevations in serum ALT associated with cholestyramine treatment , which has never been associated with clinically relevant liver injury .
METHODS	In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial , cholestyramine ( @g ) was administered for @ days to healthy adult volunteers .
METHODS	Serum from subjects with elevations in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) exceeding three-fold the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) were utilized for biomarker quantification .
RESULTS	In @ of @ subjects , cholestyramine treatment resulted in ALT elevation by > @x ULN ( mean @ fold ; range @-@ fold ) .
RESULTS	In these @ subjects , there was a @-fold mean increase in serum levels of miR-@ relative to baseline , supporting a liver origin of the serum ALT .
RESULTS	Significant elevations were noted in mean levels of necrosis biomarkers sorbitol dehydrogenase ( @ fold ) , cytokeratin @ ( @ fold ) and HMGB@ ( @ fold ) .
RESULTS	Caspase-cleaved cytokeratin @ , a biomarker of apoptosis was also significantly elevated ( @ fold ) .
RESULTS	A rise in glutamate dehydrogenase ( @ fold ) may support mitochondrial dysfunction .
CONCLUSIONS	All toxicity biomarkers measured in this study were elevated along with ALT , confirming the liver origin and reflecting both hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis .
CONCLUSIONS	Since cholestyramine treatment has no clinical liver safety concerns , we conclude that interpretation of the biomarkers studied may not be straightforward in the context of assessing liver safety of new drugs .

BACKGROUND	Type @ diabetes can often be prevented by lifestyle modification ; however , successful lifestyle intervention programmes are labour intensive .
BACKGROUND	Mobile phone messaging is an inexpensive alternative way to deliver educational and motivational advice about lifestyle modification .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether mobile phone messaging that encouraged lifestyle change could reduce incident type @ diabetes in Indian Asian men with impaired glucose tolerance .
METHODS	We did a prospective , parallel-group , randomised controlled trial between Aug @ , @ , and Nov @ , @ , at ten sites in southeast India .
METHODS	Working Indian men ( aged @-@ years ) with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) with a computer-generated randomisation sequence to a mobile phone messaging intervention or standard care ( control group ) .
METHODS	Participants in the intervention group received frequent mobile phone messages compared with controls who received standard lifestyle modification advice at baseline only .
METHODS	Field staff and participants were , by necessity , not masked to study group assignment , but allocation was concealed from laboratory personnel as well as principal and co-investigators .
METHODS	The primary outcome was incidence of type @ diabetes , analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	We assessed @ participants for eligibility .
RESULTS	@ patients were randomly assigned to either the mobile phone messaging intervention ( n = @ ) or standard care ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of type @ diabetes was lower in those who received mobile phone messages than in controls : @ ( @ % ) participants in the intervention group developed type @ diabetes compared with @ ( @ % ) in the control group ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number needed to treat to prevent one case of type @ diabetes was @ ( @ % CI @-@ ) .
RESULTS	One patient in the control group died suddenly at the end of the first year .
RESULTS	We recorded no other serious adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Mobile phone messaging is an effective and acceptable method to deliver advice and support towards lifestyle modification to prevent type @ diabetes in men at high risk .

OBJECTIVE	We studied the unclear question whether blood pressure ( BP ) lowering reduces cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in elderly individuals with systolic BP < @ mm Hg .
RESULTS	We initiated a randomized placebo-controlled stratified @ @ factorial clinical trial evaluating the effects of BP lowering in @ @ elderly individuals with systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) between @ and @ mm Hg , for @ years .
RESULTS	Following @-week active run-in , participants were randomized to aliskiren ( @ mg ) or placebo , and to an additional antihypertensive -LSB- hydrochlorothiazide ( @ mg ) or amlodipine ( @ mg ) -RSB- , or their respective placeboes .
RESULTS	Study was terminated by sponsor after @ subjects ( age @ @ years , @ % receiving at least one antihypertensive ) were randomized and followed for @ year .
RESULTS	Study drugs were well tolerated with few serious adverse events during run-in and after randomization , with no significant differences between treatment groups .
RESULTS	By design , three levels of BP reductions were achieved , adjusted mean BP reductions of @ / @ mm Hg ( P < @ ) by aliskiren , @ / @ mm Hg ( P < @ ) by hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine , and @ / @ mm Hg ( P < @ ) by double therapy compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Twenty-five major CVD events occurred .
RESULTS	Non-significant trends towards fewer CVD events with greater BP reductions are evident : hazard ratios ( HR ) @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @-@ @ -RSB- for @ mm Hg SBP reduction ; HR @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) for @ mm Hg ; and HR @ ( @-@ @ ) for @ mm Hg reduction for primary composite of CV death , MI , stroke , or significant heart failure .
CONCLUSIONS	Sizeable reductions in BP , with potential for substantial CVD reduction , can be safely achieved using combinations of BP drugs in the elderly with normal high and Stage @ hypertension .

BACKGROUND	As a result of research suggesting increased health risk with low serum @-hydroxycholecalciferol ( @ ( OH ) D ) , health care providers are measuring it frequently .
BACKGROUND	Providers and patients are faced with treatment choices when low status is identified .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the safety and efficacy of three vitamin D@ dietary supplements with different delivery matrices .
METHODS	A @-week , parallel group , single-masked , clinical trial was conducted in Seattle , Washington and Kailua Kona , Hawaii .
METHODS	Sixty-six healthy adults with ( @ ( OH ) D ) < @ ng/mL were randomly assigned to take one of three D@ supplements , ie , a chewable tablet ( TAB ) , an oil-emulsified drop ( DROP ) , or an encapsulated powder ( CAP ) at a label-claimed dose of @,@ IU/day .
METHODS	Actual D@ content was assessed by a third party and the results adjusted based on the actual D@ content administered .
METHODS	Mean change in @ ( OH ) D/mcg D@ administered ; difference in the proportion of D@ insufficient participants ( ie , @ ( OH ) D @ ng/mL ) reaching sufficiency ( ie , @ ( OH ) D @ ng/mL ) ; and mean change in serum @ , @-dihydroxycholecalciferol were measured .
RESULTS	In two of the three products tested , the measured vitamin D@ content varied considerably from the label-claimed dose .
RESULTS	Differences in @ ( OH ) D/mcg D@ administered were significantly different between groups ( P = @ ; n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pairwise comparisons demonstrated DROP resulted in a greater increase than TAB ( P < @ ) but not than CAP .
RESULTS	TAB was not different from CAP .
RESULTS	The proportions reaching sufficiency were : @ % ( TAB and CAP ) and @ % ( DROP ) ( P = @ between groups ; n = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ , @-Dihydroxycholecalciferol did not change significantly in any group .
CONCLUSIONS	Oil-emulsified vitamin D@ supplements resulted in a greater mean change in serum @ ( OH ) D concentration , but fewer patients reaching vitamin D sufficiency , than chewable or encapsulated supplements .

BACKGROUND	In the REPAIR-AMI trial , intracoronary infusion of bone marrow-derived cells ( BMCs ) was associated with a significantly greater recovery of contractile function in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) at @-month follow-up than placebo infusion .
BACKGROUND	The current analysis investigates clinical outcome and predictors of event-free survival at @ years .
RESULTS	In the multicentre , placebo-controlled , double-blind REPAIR-AMI trial , @ patients received intracoronary infusion of BMCs ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) into the infarct vessel @-@ days following successful percutaneous coronary intervention .
RESULTS	Fifteen patients died in the placebo group compared with seven patients in the BMC group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Nine placebo-treated patients and five BMC-treated patients required rehospitalization for chronic heart failure ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The combined endpoint cardiac/cardiovascular/unknown death or rehospitalisation for heart failure was more frequent in the placebo compared with the BMC group ( @ vs. @ events ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Univariate predictors of adverse outcomes were age , the CADILLAC risk score , aldosterone antagonist and diuretic treatment , changes in left ventricular ejection fraction , left ventricular end-systolic volume , and N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( all P < @ ) at @ months in the entire cohort and in the placebo group .
RESULTS	In contrast , in the BMC group , only the basal ( P = @ ) and the stromal cell-derived factor-@-induced ( P = @ ) migratory capacity of the administered BMC were associated with improved clinical outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients of the REPAIR-AMI trial , established clinical parameters are associated with adverse outcome at @ years exclusively in the placebo group , whereas the migratory capacity of the administered BMC determines event-free survival in the BMC-treated patients .
CONCLUSIONS	These data disclose a potency-effect relationship between cell therapy and long-term outcome in patients with AMI .

BACKGROUND	Xpert MTB/RIF is approved for use in tuberculosis ( TB ) and rifampicin-resistance diagnosis .
BACKGROUND	However , data are limited on the impact of Xpert under routine conditions in settings with high TB burden .
RESULTS	A pragmatic prospective cluster-randomised trial of Xpert for all individuals with presumptive ( symptomatic ) TB compared to the routine diagnostic algorithm of sputum microscopy and limited use of culture was conducted in a large TB/HIV primary care clinic .
RESULTS	The primary outcome was the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases not initiating TB treatment by @ mo after presentation .
RESULTS	Secondary outcomes included time to TB treatment and mortality .
RESULTS	Unblinded randomisation occurred on a weekly basis .
RESULTS	Xpert and smear microscopy were performed on site .
RESULTS	Analysis was both by intention to treat ( ITT ) and per protocol .
RESULTS	Between @ September @ and @ October @ , @,@ participants were assigned to the Xpert ( n = @ ) and routine ( n = @,@ ) diagnostic algorithms ( ITT analysis ) ; @ received Xpert and @,@ routine ( per protocol analysis ) .
RESULTS	@ % ( @/@ ) of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB ( smear , culture , or Xpert ) did not initiate treatment by @ mo after presentation in the Xpert arm , compared to @ % ( @/@ ) in the routine arm ( ITT analysis , risk ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The yield of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases among patients with presumptive TB was @ % ( @/@ ,@ ) with routine diagnosis and @ % ( @/@ ) with Xpert diagnosis ( ITT analysis , risk ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	This difference in diagnosis rates resulted in a higher rate of treatment initiation in the Xpert arm : @ % ( @/@ ,@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) in the routine and Xpert arms , respectively ( ITT analysis , risk ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Time to treatment initiation was improved overall ( ITT analysis , hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) and among HIV-infected participants ( ITT analysis , hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in @-mo mortality with Xpert versus routine diagnosis .
RESULTS	Study limitations included incorrect intervention allocation for a high proportion of participants and that the study was conducted in a single clinic .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that in this routine primary care setting , use of Xpert to diagnose TB increased the number of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB who were treated by @ mo and reduced time to treatment initiation , particularly among HIV-infected participants .

BACKGROUND	Circumsporozoite protein ( CS ) is the antigenic target for RTS , S , the most advanced malaria vaccine to date .
BACKGROUND	Heterologous prime-boost with the viral vectors simian adenovirus @ ( ChAd@ ) - modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) is the most potent inducer of T-cells in humans , demonstrating significant efficacy when expressing the preerythrocytic antigen insert multiple epitope-thrombospondin-related adhesion protein ( ME-TRAP ) .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that ChAd@-MVA containing CS may result in a significant clinical protective efficacy .
METHODS	We conducted an open-label , @-site , partially randomized Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite controlled human malaria infection ( CHMI ) study to compare the clinical efficacy of ChAd@-MVA CS with ChAd@-MVA ME-TRAP .
RESULTS	One of @ vaccinees ( @ % ) receiving ChAd@-MVA CS and @ of @ ( @ % ) receiving ChAd@-MVA ME-TRAP achieved sterile protection after CHMI .
RESULTS	Three of @ vaccinees ( @ % ) receiving ChAd@-MVA CS and @ of @ ( @ % ) receiving ChAd@-MVA ME-TRAP demonstrated a delay in time to treatment , compared with unvaccinated controls .
RESULTS	In quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses , ChAd@-MVA CS was estimated to reduce the liver parasite burden by @ % -@ % , compared with @ % -@ % for ChAd@-MVA ME-TRAP .
CONCLUSIONS	ChAd@-MVA CS does reduce the liver parasite burden , but ChAd@-MVA ME-TRAP remains the most promising antigenic insert for a vectored liver-stage vaccine .
CONCLUSIONS	Detailed analyses of parasite kinetics may allow detection of smaller but biologically important differences in vaccine efficacy that can influence future vaccine development .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the study was to compare behavioral outcomes ( physical activity , sedentary behavior , smoking cessation , diet ) between the intervention and usual care conditions from the TEAMcare trial .
METHODS	TEAMcare was a randomized trial among @ adults with depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or coronary heart disease that promoted health behavior change and pharmacotherapy to improve health .
METHODS	Behavioral outcomes were measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( physical activity , sitting time ) and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure ( smoking , diet , exercise ) .
METHODS	Poisson regression models among completers ( N = @ ) were conducted adjusting for age , education , smoking status and depression .
RESULTS	Intervention participants had more days/week following a healthy eating plan -LSB- relative rate = @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @-@ @ -RSB- and more days of participation in @ min of physical activity ( relative rate = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) compared to usual care .
RESULTS	Intervention participants were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines ( @ % increase ) compared to usual care ( @ % decrease ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Diet and activity generally improved for those receiving the intervention , while there were no differences in some aspects of diet ( fruit and vegetable and high-fat food intake ) , smoking status and sitting time between conditions in the TEAMcare trial .

BACKGROUND	The @ American Heart Association guidelines suggested an increase in cardiopulmonary resuscitation compression depth with a target > @ mm and no upper limit .
BACKGROUND	This target is based on limited evidence , and we sought to determine the optimal compression depth range .
RESULTS	We studied emergency medical services-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed Analysis clinical trial and the Epistry-Cardiac Arrest database .
RESULTS	We calculated adjusted odds ratios for survival to hospital discharge , @-day survival , and any return of circulation .
RESULTS	We included @ adult patients from @ US and Canadian cities with a mean age of @ years , mean compression depth of @ mm , and a return of circulation of @ % , @-day survival of @ % , and survival to hospital discharge of @ % .
RESULTS	For survival to discharge , the adjusted odds ratios were @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) for each @-mm increment in compression depth , @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) for cases within @ depth range ( > @ mm ) , and @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) for percentage of minutes in depth range ( @ % change ) .
RESULTS	Covariate-adjusted spline curves revealed that the maximum survival is at a depth of @ mm ( @-mm interval with highest survival between @ and @ mm ) with no differences between men and women .
CONCLUSIONS	This large study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients demonstrated that increased cardiopulmonary resuscitation compression depth is strongly associated with better survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Our adjusted analyses , however , found that maximum survival was in the depth interval of @ to @ mm ( peak , @ mm ) , suggesting that the @ American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation guideline target may be too high .

BACKGROUND	Former sleep studies among non-treatment seeking chronic cocaine users had captured polysomnographic changes for as long as three weeks of abstinence .
METHODS	@ cocaine dependent participants , randomized to placebo in an ongoing clinical trial , received @ days of inpatient substance abuse treatment followed by @ weeks of outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy .
METHODS	Polysomnographic recording was performed on consecutive nights during the @st and @nd inpatient and @rd and @th outpatient weeks .
METHODS	Number of days abstinent was determined from thrice weekly urine toxicology and self-report .
METHODS	Polysomnographic sleep was compared between study week @ and @ , using paired t-tests .
METHODS	Trajectory of total sleep time ( TST ) was modeled both as a linear and a quadratic function of days abstinent .
RESULTS	Despite reporting an improvement in overall sleep quality , polysomnographic sleep worsened from week @ to @ .
RESULTS	Among all participants , TST and stage @ sleep time decreased , while REM sleep latency increased .
RESULTS	Among participants who began the study with a positive urine test , there was also a decrease in REM and a trend for decreased slow wave sleep .
RESULTS	TST compared to number of days abstinent ( up to @ days ) was best fit with a quadratic model ( p = @ ) , suggesting the possibility of an improvement in total sleep time with extended abstinence .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first polysomnographic characterization of sleep in a large sample of cocaine users in treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Present findings confirm earlier results of poor and deteriorating sleep early in abstinence , and raise the possibility of improvement after an extended abstinence .

METHODS	Tertiary referral center in the Central Denmark Region .
METHODS	Forty-seven adults with normal skin quality .
METHODS	Operation with a BAHI system with randomization to @ ) dermatome technique with soft tissue removal and @ ) linear incision with no soft tissue reduction .
METHODS	Holgers ' score , pain , and sensibility loss assessed at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ days and @ , @ , @ , and @ months postoperatively .
METHODS	Implant loss .
RESULTS	Forty-nine patients were randomized ( linear incision , n = @ ; dermatome , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Forty-seven patients were analyzed ( linear incision , n = @ ; dermatome , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Differences in proportions for grouped data ( outcome @ and outcome > @ ) for the total of all visits were Holgers ' Index : @ ( p = @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ) ; sensibility loss : @ ( p = @ @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) ; pain : @ ( p = @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Soft tissue reactions and pain were most prominent in the early postoperative period , whereas issues with sensibility loss subsided throughout the @-year follow-up period .
RESULTS	No implants were lost .
CONCLUSIONS	In a randomized trial for BAHI surgery , the linear incision with no subcutaneous reduction had a faster healing time and inflicted less pain and sensibility loss than the dermatome technique .
CONCLUSIONS	The long-term soft tissue problems were similar in the two groups , thus favoring the linear incision , which is less invasive .

OBJECTIVE	The combined IVGTT-hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp ( Botnia clamp ) allows the assessment of insulin secretion and sensitivity in one experiment .
OBJECTIVE	It remains unclear whether this clamp yields results comparable with those of the standard hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp ( SHEC ) in diabetes patients .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that the IVGTT induces responses affecting insulin sensitivity assessment .
METHODS	Of @ randomised diet - or metformin-treated patients with well-controlled type @ diabetes , @ randomly underwent a Botnia clamp and an SHEC , spaced by @ weeks , in one clinical research centre in a crossover study .
METHODS	The main outcomes were whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity as measured by the clamp and -LSB- @,@ - ( @ ) H@ -RSB- glucose .
METHODS	Substrate utilisation was assessed from indirect calorimetry and beta cell function from insulin dynamics during IVGTT .
RESULTS	The values of whole-body insulin sensitivity obtained from Botnia clamp and SHEC were correlated ( r = @ , p < @ ) , but also revealed intra-individual variations .
RESULTS	Hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between experiments during the clamp , but differed after IVGTT .
RESULTS	The contribution of glucose oxidation to glucose disposal increased by @ @ and @ @ mg kg fat-free mass ( FFM ) ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ( Botnia and SHEC , p < @ ) , whereas lipid oxidation decreased by @ @ and @ @ mg kg FFM ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ( p < @ ) from baseline .
RESULTS	Differences in NEFA ( r = -@ , p < @ ) , but not C-peptide ( r = -@ , p = @ ) or hepatic insulin sensitivity between IVGTT and placebo before the clamps correlated with individual variations of insulin sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	The Botnia clamp provides similar estimates of insulin sensitivity as SHEC in patients with type @ diabetes , but changes in NEFA during IVGTT may affect insulin sensitivity and thereby the discrimination between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals .

BACKGROUND	Acute appendicitis is the most common reason for abdominal surgery in young adults and children .
BACKGROUND	Open appendectomy is still the treatment often chosen because it is simple , safe , and effective .
BACKGROUND	Our aim was to study whether cosmetic results of appendectomy wounds are better after using continuous absorbable intradermal ( A ) sutures compared with wound closure with interrupted nonabsorbable ( NA ) sutures .
METHODS	A total of @ adult patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were allocated to the study and prospectively randomized into two wound-closure groups : the interrupted NA suture group and the A suture group .
METHODS	Of these , @ patients with sufficient data were invited to the outpatient clinic for cosmetic analysis .
METHODS	Cosmetic results were evaluated after a median of @ months .
METHODS	For subjective scar assessment , the Vancouver scar scale , the patient and observer scar assessment scale ( POSAS ) , and a visual analog scale ( VAS ) were used .
METHODS	Objective evaluation was carried out by measuring surface area , average width , and estimated concentration change ( ECC ) of hemoglobin and melanin in the scar using spectrocutometry .
METHODS	For statistical analyses we used the Mann-Whitney test and Student 's t test .
RESULTS	Both objective and subjective analyses showed better cosmetic results for absorbable intradermal suturing .
RESULTS	The difference between the two groups was statistically significant as regards POSAS in both patient ( p = @ ) and observer scales ( p = @ ) , and VAS ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Scar surface area was significantly smaller in group A than in group NA ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	ECC measurements showed higher values for melanin in group NA than in group A ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Continuous intradermal absorbable suturing yields a better cosmetic result than interrupted nonabsorbable suturing in lower abdominal transverse appendectomy .

RESULTS	Although measures of the quality of diabetes care improved in all @ groups ( all P < @ ) , improvement was greater in CQI practices compared with both SD practices ( P < @ ) and RAP practices ( P < @ ) ; additionally , improvement was greater in SD practices compared with RAP practices ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In RAP practices , Change Culture scores showed a trend toward improvement at @ months ( P = @ ) but decreased below baseline at @ months ( P < @ ) , while Work Culture scores decreased from @ to @ months ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Both scores were stable over time in SD and CQI practices .
CONCLUSIONS	Traditional CQI interventions are effective at improving measures of the quality of diabetes care , but may not improve practice change and work culture .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-term practice facilitation based on RAP principles produced less improvement in quality measures than CQI or SD interventions and also did not produce sustained improvements in practice culture .

OBJECTIVE	Intracoronary thrombus is disrupted by stent deployment and confounded by the development of intrastent plaque prolapse .
OBJECTIVE	This study aims at investigating the feasibility and repeatability of thrombus quantification prior to stent implantation using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patients .
RESULTS	Patients were enrolled in an OCT substudy of the TOTAL trial ( a randomized trial of routine aspiration ThrOmbecTomy with PCI vs. PCI ALone in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI ) of aspiration thrombectomy or percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) alone in primary PCI ( PPCI ) of STEMI .
RESULTS	Using OCT , thrombus burden ( TB ) and other measures of pre - and post-stent atherothrombus were analysed over the arterial segment defined by the final stent length .
RESULTS	Feasibility was @ % ( @/@ patients ) for both pre - and post-stent OCT imaging .
RESULTS	Altogether , @ OCT cross-sections were analysed .
RESULTS	In Bland-Altman analyses of inter-observer variation ( n = @ ) , the mean pre-stent TB was @ % for Observer @ and @ % for Observer @ ( limits of agreement -@ to @ % ) .
RESULTS	In Bland-Altman analyses of intra-observer variation ( n = @ ) , the mean pre-stent TB was @ % for the first and @ % for the second round of analysis by Observer @ ( limits of agreement -@ to @ % ) .
RESULTS	There was a good correlation between pre-stent TB and pre-stent quadrants with thrombus/mm ( r = @ ) , but only modest correlation between pre-stent TB and post-stent atherothrombotic burden ( ATB ; r = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Measurement of pre-stent TB by OCT during the PPCI of STEMI is feasible and highly repeatable .
CONCLUSIONS	Pre-stent TB is only modestly correlated with post-stent ATB , which indicates that pre-stent measurements might be of additional value when assessing the TB in STEMI .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of correlation between the Pelvic Organ Quantification system ( POP-Q ) measurements and symptom questionnaire scores before and after surgery .
OBJECTIVE	This was a part of a randomized controlled study comparing conventional colporrhaphy with mesh repair surgery .
METHODS	The correlation between POP-Q measurements and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire ( PFIQ-@ ) and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory ( PFDI-@ ) scores was investigated in @ women @ years or older scheduled for primary anterior vaginal wall prolapse surgery at baseline and the correlation between the change in point Ba and scores following surgery .
METHODS	Statistical analyses used McNemar 's and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests , Spearman 's rank-order correlation , and multiple linear regression .
RESULTS	Surgery significantly improved POP-Q , PFIQ-@ , and PFDI-@ scores , including subscales .
RESULTS	We observed weak correlations between POP-Q and PFIQ-@ , including subscales ( r @-@ @ , p < @ ) , and PFDI-@ , including the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory ( POPDI ) subscale ( r @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between point Ba and PFIQ-@ ( p = @ ) and PFDI-@ ( p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Furthermore , we observed a significant relationship between the change in point Ba ( following surgery ) and change in scores ; point Ba following surgery was significantly correlated with symptoms of bulging ( r = @ , p < @ ) and bladder-emptying problems ( r = @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The weak correlation between POP-Q and urogenital symptoms based on questionnaire scores suggests that neither scoring system is optimal .

OBJECTIVE	Although statins can induce coronary atheroma regression , this benefit has yet to be demonstrated in diabetic individuals .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that high-intensity statin therapy may promote coronary atheroma regression in patients with diabetes .
METHODS	The Study of Coronary Atheroma by Intravascular Ultrasound : Effect of Rosuvastatin Versus Atorvastatin ( SATURN ) used serial intravascular ultrasound measures of coronary atheroma volume in patients treated with rosuvastatin @ mg or atorvastatin @ mg for @ months .
METHODS	This analysis compared changes in biochemistry and coronary percent atheroma volume ( PAV ) in patients with ( n = @ ) and without ( n = @ ) diabetes .
RESULTS	At baseline , patients with diabetes had lower LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels but higher triglyceride and CRP levels compared with patients without diabetes .
RESULTS	At follow-up , diabetic patients had lower levels of LDL-C ( @ @ vs. @ @ mg/dL , P = @ ) and HDL-C ( @ @ vs. @ @ mg/dL , P < @ ) but higher levels of triglycerides ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- vs. @ mg/dL -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- , P = @ ) and CRP ( @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- mg/L , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both patients with and without diabetes demonstrated regression of coronary atheroma as measured by change in PAV ( -@ @ vs. -@ @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	PAV regression was less in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients when on-treatment LDL-C levels were > @ mg/dL ( -@ @ vs. -@ @ % , P = @ ) but similar when LDL-C levels were @ mg/dL ( -@ @ vs. -@ @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High-intensity statin therapy alters the progressive nature of diabetic coronary atherosclerosis , yielding regression of disease in diabetic and nondiabetic patients .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of different intracorporeal ligation techniques with titanium clips , Plasma Trisector ( Gyrus , USA ) ( PTG ) , and surgical silk on bilateral laparoscopic varicocelectomy ( LPVx ) .
METHODS	Between May @ and August @ , @ patients who underwent bilateral LPVx were evaluated .
METHODS	The demographic parameters of patients , preoperative radiological findings , semen analysis , operative data , and follow-up were recorded .
METHODS	All of the patients were divided into @ groups , randomized prospectively .
METHODS	The patients whose veins were ligated by @-mm titanium clips were included in group I , those whose veins were ligated by PTG were included in group II , and those whose veins were ligated by surgical silk were included in group III .
METHODS	The recorded data of the groups were analyzed .
RESULTS	Mean follow-up time was @ + @ months .
RESULTS	According to the demographics of age , body mass index , spermiogram , and diameter of veins before surgery , there were no statistical differences between any of the groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	However , operation time was longer in group III ( P < @ ) , while total numbers ofligated veins did not differ among the groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , hospital stay , oral intake , and complications were not different among the groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	In follow-up the sperm count analysis was higher than the preoperative count analysis for all of the groups ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	PTG may provide a shorter operation time than using titanium clips and/or surgical silk in LPVx .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , PTG may increase sperm count with fewer complications than the other ligation techniques in LPVx .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , PTG may be the new candidate electrosurgical standard device for LPVx in the nearby future .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the level of anxiety and performance of nursing students when performing a clinical simulation through the traditional method of assessment with the presence of an evaluator and through a filmed assessment without the presence of an evaluator .
METHODS	Controlled trial with the participation of Brazilian public university @ students who were randomly assigned to one of two groups : a ) assessment through the traditional method with the presence of an evaluator ; or b ) filmed assessment .
METHODS	The level of anxiety was assessed using the Zung test and performance was measured based on the number of correct answers .
RESULTS	Averages of @ and @ were obtained on the anxiety scale by the group assessed through the traditional method before and after the simulation , respectively , while the filmed group obtained averages of @ and @ ; the final scores correspond to mild anxiety .
RESULTS	Even though there was a statistically significant reduction in the intra-groups scores before and after the simulation , there was no difference between the groups .
RESULTS	As for the performance assessments in the clinical simulation , the groups obtained similar percentages of correct answers ( @ % in the traditional assessment and @ % in the filmed assessment ) without statistically significant differences .
CONCLUSIONS	Filming can be used and encouraged as a strategy to assess nursing undergraduate students .

BACKGROUND	We aimed to evaluate whether oral anticoagulants ( OACs ) alter faecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) performance in average-risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening .
METHODS	Individuals aged @-@ years were invited to receive one FIT sample ( cutoff @ ng ml ( -@ ) ) between November @ and June @ .
RESULTS	Faecal immunochemical test was positive in @ % ( @ out of @ ) of users of OAC and @ % ( @ out of @ ) of non-users ( P-trend = @ ) .
RESULTS	The positive predictive value ( PPV ) for advanced neoplasia ( AN ) in non-users was @ % vs @ % in users ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The PPV for AN in OAC more antiplatelets ( aspirin or clopidogrel ) was @ % ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral anticoagulant did not significantly modify the PPV for AN in this population-based colorectal screening program .
CONCLUSIONS	The detection rate of advanced adenoma was higher in the combination OAC more antiplatelets .

BACKGROUND	Virtual patients ( VPs ) offer valuable alternative encounters when live patients with rare conditions , such as cranial nerve ( CN ) palsies , are unavailable ; however , little is known regarding simulation and optimal social learning context .
OBJECTIVE	Compare learning outcomes and perspectives between students interacting with VPs in individual and team contexts .
METHODS	Seventy-eight medical students were randomly assigned to interview and examine four VPs with possible CN damage either as individuals or in three-person teams , using Neurological Examination Rehearsal Virtual Environment ( NERVE ) .
METHODS	Learning was measured through diagnosis accuracy and pre - / post-simulation knowledge scores .
METHODS	Perspectives of learning context were collected post-simulation .
RESULTS	Students in teams submitted correct diagnoses significantly more often than students as individuals for CN-IV ( p = @ ; team = @ % ; individual = @ % ) and CN-VI ( p = @ ; team = @ % ; individual = @ % ) .
RESULTS	Knowledge scores increased significantly in both contexts ( p < @ ) ; however , a significant aptitude-treatment interaction effect was observed ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At pre-test scores @ % , students in teams scored significantly higher ( @ % ) than students as individuals ( @ % ) at post-test ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Students recommended implementing future NERVE exercises in teams over five other modality-timing combinations .
CONCLUSIONS	Results allow us to define best practices for integrating VP simulators into medical education .
CONCLUSIONS	Implementing NERVE experiences in team environments with medical students in the future may be preferable .

BACKGROUND	Exercise-induced cough ( EIC ) is frequently reported by winter athletes , but this symptom is not always associated with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) .
BACKGROUND	The aims of this study were to determine if EIC can be inhibited or reduced with the inhalation of ipratropium , and if EIC in winter athletes is associated with EIB .
METHODS	On @ visits , @ cross-country skiers ( @ males and @ females , mean age @ @ years ) performed an outdoor exercise in the winter ( @-minute warm-up , followed by a @-minute sprint ) , randomly preceded by the inhalation of ipratropium or a placebo .
METHODS	A spirometry was done at baseline and @ minutes after inhalation of ipratropium or placebo .
METHODS	Exercise was then performed , followed by the measurement of forced expiratory volume in @ second and the recording of the number of coughs until @ minutes after exercise .
METHODS	Before and after exercise , the perception of cough intensity was evaluated using a modified Borg scale .
RESULTS	Twelve of @ athletes who completed the study ( @ % ) were symptomatic following exercise with placebo ( number of coughs @ ) , but none developed EIB .
RESULTS	For these athletes , the number of coughs after exercise ( mean number of coughs standard deviation : placebo , @ @ ; ipratropium , @ @ ; P value , nonsignificant ) and the maximal perception score for cough intensity ( mean Borg score standard deviation : placebo , @ @ ; ipratropium , @ @ ; P value , nonsignificant ) were not significantly different between ipratropium and placebo .
RESULTS	A decrease in the number of coughs was observed in @ of the symptomatic athletes and an increase was observed in the other @ , resulting in a nonsignificant mean effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Ipratropium does not appear to significantly influence the number and the perception of cough following exercise .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , these results suggest that EIC is not mainly associated with EIB .
CONCLUSIONS	However , a subgroup of athletes seems to show a beneficial response to ipratropium , suggesting different cough responses in this population .

###24408122
OBJECTIVE	The Avosentan on Time to Doubling of Serum Creatinine , End Stage Renal Disease or Death ( ASCEND ) trial tested the renoprotective effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist avosentan in patients with diabetes and nephropathy , but the study was terminated due to an excess of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) events in the avosentan arms , likely due to fluid retention .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to identify risk markers of CHF after treatment with avosentan .
METHODS	In a post hoc analysis of the ASCEND trial ( N = @ participants ) , we assessed which baseline characteristics predicted CHF risk during avosentan treatment .
METHODS	Furthermore , postrandomization changes between baseline and the first available measurement of body weight and hemoglobin were examined as potential clinical indicators of fluid retention for their relationship with CHF development .
RESULTS	Relative to placebo , avosentan increased CHF risk ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The avosentan-related CHF risk was higher with lower baseline cholesterol levels ( P interaction = @ ) and concomitant statin use ( P interaction = @ ) , whereas it was lower with a lower estimated GFR ( P interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients allocated to avosentan had a median body weight increase of @ kg ( interquartile range , @ to @ kg ) and a median hemoglobin decrease of @ g/dl ( interquartile range , -@ to -@ g/dl ) at the first postrandomization measurement .
RESULTS	The body weight increase induced by avosentan was associated with CHF development ( P interaction = @ ) , whereas hemoglobin decrease was not ( P interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	The increase in body weight was particularly pronounced in patients with a cardiovascular disease history and in patients using statins .
CONCLUSIONS	In avosentan-treated patients , body weight increase , but not hemoglobin decrease , was associated with CHF development , indicating that close body weight monitoring could provide an early signal of CHF development in future trials with endothelin receptor antagonists .

###24681859
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to measure round window ( RW ) diameters in patients with congenital aural atresia ( CAA ) or sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) and a normal control group and to analyze whether differences exist between these groups .
METHODS	Temporal bone computed tomographic scans of @ patients with CAA ( @ males , @ females ) aged @ to @ years ( median age , @ years ) , @ patients with SNHL ( @ males , @ females ) aged @ to @ years ( median age , @ years ) , and @ patients ( @ males , @ females ) aged @ months to @ years ( median age , @ years ) randomly selected from a pool of patients with unilateral chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma were reviewed .
METHODS	We measured RW diameter on oblique reconstruction planes .
METHODS	To prevent possible individual differences , skull width was measured .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences between all groups for skull width .
RESULTS	Both RW diameter and RW membrane width were found smaller in the CAA group than both SNHL group and control group with statistical significance , whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the SNHL group and the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that both the RW diameter and RW membrane width in CAA were smaller than those in the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	If this finding is supported in future studies , the production of floating mass transducer with different sizes may be useful .
CONCLUSIONS	We suggest that RW diameter should be measured in each patient before operation and thus a floating mass transducer with the appropriate caliber should be chosen .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the characteristics of residual symptoms and to evaluate the effects of adjuvant vestibular suppressants on residual symptoms after successful canalith repositioning procedures ( CRPs ) .
METHODS	Individual randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	One hundred fifty patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who achieved successful CRPs on initial visit participated in this study .
METHODS	Dizziness Handicap Inventory ( DHI ) questionnaires were completed before CRPs .
METHODS	All study populations were divided into three groups after successful CRPs on the initial visit day : the medication ( V ) group ( treated with a vestibular suppressant -LSB- dimenhydrinate @ mg per day -RSB- ) , the placebo ( P ) group , and the no medication ( N ) group .
METHODS	One week after successful CRPs , residual symptoms were checked and repeated DHI questionnaires were completed to compare residual symptoms .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients who did not show positional nystagmus at follow-up , @ ( @ % ) complained of residual symptoms .
RESULTS	The presence of residual symptoms was more prevalent in the P and N group compared with the V group ( P = @ , P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The most frequent residual symptom was lightheadedness ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Moreover , in the V group , lightheadedness was significantly reduced compared with the P group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , in the analysis of DHI , total and subscale scores did not differ across the three groups before or after successful CRP .
CONCLUSIONS	Vestibular suppressants significantly reduced residual symptoms compared to both placebo and no medication after CRP .
CONCLUSIONS	However , there was no significant reduction in DHI score compared with the control group , suggesting that the residual symptoms could not be evaluated by DHI score alone .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of perioperative immunomodulatory therapy on postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer .
METHODS	This prospective study was conducted among @ rectal/anal cancer patients undergoing intersphincteric resection at our center between January , @ and January , @ , among whom @ were eligible to be included and completed the study .
METHODS	The @ patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion into @ equal groups to receive immunomodulatory therapy with @ mg/kg celecoxib ( group A ) , @ mg/kg Sou-Medrol ( group B ) , or placebo ( group C ) , given daily from @ days before surgery to @ days after surgery , and the postoperative cancer recurrence were compared .
RESULTS	At @ days after the operation , the @ groups showed significantly different C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels , which decreased obviously in all the @ groups compared with those at @ day following the operation ( P = @ ) , especially in group B.
RESULTS	The levels of interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) at @ days after the operation also differed significantly between the @ groups but were lower in all the @ groups than those at @ day after the operation ( P = @ ) , and this reduction was the most obvious in group A. COX-@ expression differed significantly between the @ groups ( P = @ ) , among which group A showed the most obvious suppression of COX-@ expression .
RESULTS	During the follow-up for a mean of @ months , no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the @ groups ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	With a lower efficacy than Sou-Medrol in decreasing postoperative inflammation , celecoxib produces a better effect in inhibiting COX-@ expression , but it does not lower postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer .

BACKGROUND	In trials of behavioural interventions , the individuals who deliver the intervention are in a position of key influence on the success of the trial .
BACKGROUND	Their fidelity to the intervention is crucial .
BACKGROUND	Yet little is understood about the experiences of this group of trial personnel .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to investigate the views and experiences of educators who delivered a structured education intervention to people with type @ diabetes , which incorporated training in self-monitoring of either blood glucose ( SMBG ) or urine glucose ( SMUG ) as part of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) .
METHODS	Educators ' views were explored through focus groups before and after training ( N = @ ) and approximately @ year into the trial ( N = @ ) , and semi-structured telephone interviews at approximately @ years ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Analysis was based on the constant comparative method .
RESULTS	Educators held preferences regarding the intervention variants ; thus , they were not in individual equipoise .
RESULTS	Training raised awareness of preferences and their potential to impact on delivery .
RESULTS	Educators were confident in their unbiased delivery , but acknowledged the challenges involved .
RESULTS	Concealing their preferences was helped by a sense of professionalism , the patient-centred nature of the intervention , and concessions in the trial protocol ( enabling participants to swap monitoring methods if needed ) .
RESULTS	Commitment to unbiased delivery was explained through a desire for evidence-based knowledge in the contentious area of SMBG .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings provide insight into a previously unexplored group of trial personnel -- intervention deliverers in trials of behavioural interventions -- which will be useful to those designing and running similar trials .
CONCLUSIONS	Rather than individual equipoise , it is intervention deliverers ' awareness of personal preferences and their potential impact on the trial outcome that facilitates unbiased delivery .
CONCLUSIONS	Further , awareness of community equipoise , the need for evidence , and relevance to the individual enhance commitment to the RCT .

###25480457
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to determine whether varying the format used to present prognostic data alters the perception of risk among surrogate decision makers in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) .
METHODS	This was a prospective randomized comparative trial conducted in a @-bed adult tertiary ICU .
METHODS	Enrolled surrogate decision makers were randomized to @ of @ questionnaires , which presented hypothetical ICU scenarios , identical other than the format in which prognostic data were presented ( eg , frequencies vs percentages ) .
METHODS	Participants were asked to rate the risk associated with each prognostic statement .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ surrogate decision makers .
RESULTS	The perception of risk varied significantly dependent on the presentation format .
RESULTS	For `` quantitative data , '' risks were consistently perceived as higher , when presented as frequencies ( eg , @ in @ ) compared with equivalent percentages ( eg , @ % ) .
RESULTS	Framing `` qualitative data '' in terms of chance of `` death '' rather than `` survival '' led to a statistically significant increase in perceived risks .
RESULTS	Framing `` quantitative '' data in this way did not significantly affect risk perception .
CONCLUSIONS	Data format had a significant effect on how surrogate decision makers interpreted risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Qualitative statements are interpreted widely and affected by framing .
CONCLUSIONS	Where possible , multiple quantitative formats should be used for presenting prognostic information .

OBJECTIVE	The training response of an intensified period of high-intensity exercise is not clear .
OBJECTIVE	Therefore , we compared the cardiovascular adaptations of completing @ high-intensity aerobic interval training sessions carried out for either three or eight weeks , respectively .
METHODS	Twenty-one healthy subjects ( @ years , @ females ) completed @ high-intensity training sessions throughout a time-period of either eight weeks ( moderate frequency , MF ) or three weeks ( high frequency , HF ) followed by a detraining period of nine weeks without any training .
METHODS	In both groups , maximal oxygen uptake ( VO@max ) was evaluated before training , at the @ ( th ) and @ ( th ) session and four days after the final @ ( th ) training session .
METHODS	In the detraining phase VO@max was evaluated after @ days and thereafter every second week for eight weeks .
METHODS	Left ventricular echocardiography , carbon monoxide lung diffusion transfer factor , brachial artery flow mediated dilatation and vastus lateralis citrate maximal synthase activity was tested before and after training .
RESULTS	The cardiovascular adaptation after HF training was delayed compared to training with MF .
RESULTS	Four days after ending training the HF group showed no improvement ( +@ % , p = @ ) , whereas the MF group reached their highest VO@max with a @ % improvement ( p < @ : group difference p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The HF group reached their highest VO@max ( @ % increase , p = @ ) twelve days into the detraining period , compared to a concomitant reduction to @ % of VO@max ( p < @ ) above baseline in the MF group ( group difference p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both HF and MF training of high-intensity aerobic exercise improves VO@max .
CONCLUSIONS	The cardiovascular adaptation following a HF programme of high-intensity exercise is however delayed compared to MF training .

OBJECTIVE	Impaired arterial function has been implicated in diabetes-related atherosclerosis , but its determinants in high-risk adults have not been well characterised .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated factors associated with impaired arterial function in adults with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	Flow-mediated dilatation ( a marker of endothelial function ) and dilator response to glyceryl trinitrate ( to assess smooth muscle function ) of the brachial artery were assessed at baseline in @ patients with type @ diabetes from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes ( FIELD ) study .
METHODS	Traditional risk factors were assessed and a multivariable model was constructed to identify factors independently associated with impaired arterial function .
RESULTS	Median age was @ years ( interquartile range , @-@ ; @ % male ) and duration of diabetes was @ years ( interquartile range , @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Flow-mediated dilatation ( @ @ % , mean SEM ) was severely impaired but not significantly associated with other risk factors .
RESULTS	Dilator responses to glyceryl trinitrate ( @ @ % ) were significantly and independently impaired in past and present cigarette smokers ( P = @ ) and in subjects with increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In adults with type @ diabetes and known or suspected atherosclerosis , arterial smooth muscle-dependent dilatation was shown to be significantly impaired in cigarette smokers and those with elevated urinary albumin levels .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether a home-based care coordination program focused on medication self-management would affect the cost of care to the Medicare program and whether the addition of technology , a medication-dispensing machine , would further reduce cost .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled , three-arm longitudinal study .
METHODS	Participant homes in a large Midwestern urban area .
METHODS	Older adults identified as having difficulty managing their medications at discharge from Medicare Home Health Care ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	A team consisting of advanced practice nurses ( APNs ) and registered nurses ( RNs ) coordinated care for two groups : home-based nurse care coordination ( NCC ) plus a pill organizer group and NCC plus a medication-dispensing machine group .
METHODS	To measure cost , participant claims data from @ to @ were retrieved from Medicare Part A and B Standard Analytical Files .
RESULTS	Ordinary least squares regression with covariate adjustment was used to estimate monthly dollar savings .
RESULTS	Total Medicare costs were $ @ per month lower in the NCC plus pill organizer group ( P = @ ) than in a control group that received usual care .
RESULTS	For participants in the study at least @ months , total Medicare costs were $ @ lower per month in the NCC plus pill organizer group ( P = @ ) than in the control group .
RESULTS	The cost of the NCC plus pill organizer intervention was $ @ per month , yielding a net savings of $ @ per month or $ @,@ per year .
RESULTS	The cost of the NCC plus medication-dispensing machine intervention was $ @ per month , and total Medicare costs were $ @ higher per month than in the NCC plus pill organizer group .
CONCLUSIONS	Nurse care coordination plus a pill organizer is a cost-effective intervention for frail elderly Medicare beneficiaries .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of the medication machine did not enhance the cost effectiveness of the intervention .

BACKGROUND	Numerous animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that erythropoietin ( EPO ) has therapeutic effects in ischemic and degenerative diseases .
BACKGROUND	However , few clinical trials have investigated the effect of EPO in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients .
BACKGROUND	This study was an exploratory pilot study to investigate the effects of recombinant human EPO ( rhEPO ) on motor and non-motor symptoms ( NMS ) in PD patients .
METHODS	A total of @ PD patients at the Hanyang University Hospital were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	The participants were randomly assigned to rhEPO and placebo groups .
METHODS	The rhEPO group was infused intravenously ( @,@ IU each ) twice a week for @ weeks .
METHODS	Clinical improvement was estimated using the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale-III ( UPDRS-III ) , the NMS Scale ( NMSS ) and the @-Item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ-@ ) .
METHODS	-LSB- ( @ ) F -RSB- N - ( @-fluoropropyl ) -@ - carbon ethoxy-@ - ( @-iodophenyl ) nortropane ( FP-CIT ) photon emission tomography ( PET ) scanning was performed on each participant at baseline and again after @ months .
RESULTS	The rhEPO administration significantly improved the NMSS and PDQ-@ scores at @ months .
RESULTS	The UPDRS-III , which reflects motor function , did not change significantly after the rhEPO treatment .
RESULTS	With the NMSS , the domains of cardiovascular autonomic function , sleep/fatigue , mood/cognition and attention/memory showed significant changes .
RESULTS	None of the participants experienced any serious adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that rhEPO had beneficial effects on NMS but not on motor function .
CONCLUSIONS	Dopaminergic refractory NMS , such as cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cognition , showed improvement after the administration of rhEPO .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that rhEPO might be a good candidate for the treatment of NMS in PD patients .

OBJECTIVE	Girdles and abdominal binders may reduce pain and stabilize the abdominal wall after laparotomy , but a risk for increased intra-abdominal pressure and decreased lung function is also hypothesized .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an abdominal girdle after midline laparotomy in a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Twenty-three patients undergoing laparotomy were randomized to wear an elastic girdle postoperatively and @ were randomized to no girdle .
METHODS	Pulmonary function was evaluated with ; forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume during one second ( FEV@ ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , and cough PEF .
METHODS	Pain was recorded using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	All patients completed the ventral hernia pain questionnaire ( VHPQ ) before surgery and at the end of the study .
METHODS	Intra-abdominal pressure was measured via an indwelling urinary catheter .
METHODS	Wound healing was assessed from photographs .
RESULTS	FVC , FEV@ , PEF , and cough PEF were reduced by about @ % after surgery , but there were no differences between patients with or without a girdle ( ANOVA ) .
RESULTS	Intra-abdominal pressure and wound healing were the same in both groups .
RESULTS	Pain was significantly lower on day @ in the girdle group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	An individually fitted elastic girdle used after midline laparotomy was found to be safe , as this did not affect lung function , coughing , intra-abdominal pressure , or wound healing .
CONCLUSIONS	The immediate decline in lung function after surgery is restrictive and due to anesthesia and the surgical procedure .
CONCLUSIONS	Pain was significantly decreased in the girdle group .
CONCLUSIONS	The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Sexual dimorphism in plasma triglyceride ( TG ) metabolism is well established but it is unclear to what extent it is driven by differences in the sex hormone milieu .
BACKGROUND	RESULTS from previous studies evaluating the effects of sex steroids on plasma TG homeostasis are inconclusive because they relied on orally administered synthetic hormone preparations or evaluated only plasma lipid concentrations but not kinetics .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemically delivered @-estradiol , progesterone , and T on very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride ( VLDL-TG ) concentration and kinetics in postmenopausal women .
METHODS	VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were evaluated by using stable isotope-labeled tracer techniques in four groups of postmenopausal women ( n = @ total ) who were studied before and after treatment with either @-estradiol ( @ mg/d via continuous delivery skin patch ) , progesterone ( @ mg/d via vaginal insert ) and T ( @ mg/d via skin gel ) , or no intervention ( control group ) .
RESULTS	VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were unchanged in the control group and not altered by T and progesterone administration .
RESULTS	Estradiol treatment , in contrast , reduced VLDL-TG concentration by approximately @ % due to accelerated VLDL-TG plasma clearance ( @ @ vs. @ @ mL/min ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Estradiol , but not progesterone or T , is a major regulator of VLDL-TG metabolism .

BACKGROUND	Ombrabulin ( AVE@ ) disrupts the vasculature of established tumours and has shown preclinical synergistic anti-tumour activity when combined with cisplatin .
BACKGROUND	In this phase @ trial , we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ombrabulin plus cisplatin compared with placebo plus cisplatin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas .
METHODS	We did this multinational , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase @ study at @ centres in ten countries .
METHODS	Patients aged @ years and older with metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas , an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of @-@ , and who had previously received treatment with anthracycline and ifosfamide were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to intravenous infusion of ombrabulin @ mg/m ( @ ) plus cisplatin @ mg/m ( @ ) or intravenous infusion of placebo plus cisplatin @ mg/m ( @ ) every @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients were allocated to treatment using a permuted blocks randomisation scheme ( block size of four ) via an interactive voice-response system , and stratified by histological subtype .
METHODS	Patients , medical staff , study investigators , and individuals who handled and analysed the data were masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	Our primary endpoint was median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	Safety analyses were done on all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug .
METHODS	This trial is now closed , and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Between June @ , @ , and April @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ patients to ombrabulin plus cisplatin ( n = @ ) or placebo plus cisplatin ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median duration of follow-up was @ ( IQR @-@ ) in the placebo group and @ months ( @-@ ) in the ombrabulin group .
RESULTS	Progression-free survival was slightly , but significantly , improved in the ombrabulin group compared with the placebo group ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- months ; hazard ratio @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Grade @ or @ adverse events occurred more frequently in individuals in the ombrabulin group than in those in the placebo group and included neutropenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the ombrabulin group vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the placebo group ) and thrombocytopenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs six -LSB- @ % -RSB- for placebo ) .
RESULTS	Adverse events leading to death occurred in @ patients in the ombrabulin group and @ patients in the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of ombrabulin and cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival ; however , it did not show a sufficient clinical benefit in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas to support its use as a therapeutic option .
CONCLUSIONS	Predictive biomarkers are needed for the rational clinical development of tumour vascular-disrupting drugs for soft-tissue sarcomas .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the curative effects of heat-sensitive moxibustion with conventional drugs on chronic persistent asthma and seek a valuable therapy to replace Western Medicine .
METHODS	The participants in this multi-center , randomized , and controlled study were randomly divided into two groups : group A ( n = @ ) , treated with heat-sensitive moxibustion ( @ sessions ) and group B ( n = @ ) , treated with Seretide ( salmeterol @ plg/fluticasone @ pg , twice a day ) .
METHODS	The scores of asthma control test ( ACT ) , forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , and attack frequency were measured after @ , @ , @ , and @ days of treatment .
METHODS	Patients followed up @ and @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	There was a significant difference ( P = @ ) in the ACT score and lung function between the two groups after @ months of treatment and ( P = @ @ ) during the follow-up visits .
RESULTS	In addition , heat-sensitive moxibustion reduced attack frequency in the period from inclusion to the @-month follow-up visit .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that heat-sensitive moxibustion may have a comparable curative effect to Seretide ( salmetero/fluticasone ) on asthma .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the efficacy of a custom-made wheelchair simulation in training children to use a powered wheelchair ( PWC ) .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial employing the @C/ID-model of learning .
METHODS	Twenty-eight typically developing children ( @M , @F ; mean age @ years , SD @ months ) were assessed on their operation of a PWC using a functional evaluation rating scale .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to intervention ( @ @-minute training sessions using a joystick operated wheelchair simulation ) or control conditions ( no task ) , and were reassessed on their PWC use after the intervention phase .
METHODS	Additional data from the simulation on completion times , errors , and total scores were recorded for the intervention group .
RESULTS	Analysis of variance showed a main effect of time , with planned comparisons revealing a statistically significant change in PWC use for the intervention ( p = @ ) but not the control condition .
RESULTS	Although the intervention group showed greater improvement than the controls , this did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	Multiple regression analyses showed that gender was predictive of pretest ( p = @ ) functional ability .
CONCLUSIONS	A simulated wheelchair task appears to be effective in helping children learn to operate a PWC .
CONCLUSIONS	Greater attention should be given to female learners who underperformed when compared with their male counterparts .
CONCLUSIONS	This low-cost intervention could be easily used at home to reduce PWC training times in children with motor disorders .

BACKGROUND	Aim of the study was to compare the chosen position of polyaxial locking screws with the position of monoaxial screws in the humeral head of proximal humeral fractures treated by locked plating .
METHODS	In a prospective randomized observational study , @ consecutive patients ( mean age @ years ) sustaining a displaced proximal humeral fracture were treated with either monoaxial or polyaxial screw-inserted locking plate fixation .
METHODS	The chosen positions of locking screws were identified from standardized postoperative radiographs in anteroposterior and outlet-view , with regard to a regional mapping of the humeral head .
RESULTS	In monoaxial locking technique , a mean of @ screws purchased the humeral head ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and in polyaxial locking technique , a mean of @ screws ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Screws were placed in the regions superolateral : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) ; superomedial : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) ; inferolateral : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) ; inferomedial : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) , superoposterior : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) ; superoanterior : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) ; inferoposterior : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial @ % ( p = @ ) and inferoanterior : monoaxial @ % , polyaxial : @ % ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The chosen screws ' position in monoaxial and polyaxial locking plate fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures do not differ significantly .
CONCLUSIONS	However , loss of fixation is observed more frequently if the fixation did not include at least one screw within the superoposterior region of the humeral head , suggesting that a screw purchasing the superoposterior region is beneficial in locked plating of proximal humeral fractures .
METHODS	Treatment Study , Level II .

BACKGROUND	The echocardiographic substudy of the OASIS-@ trial evaluated the prognostic implications of left ventricle ( LV ) systolic and diastolic dysfunction early postacute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) in patients treated with fondaparinux versus usual care .
METHODS	Comprehensive echocardiograms were performed a median of @ days after the index STEMI in @ patients , @ randomized to fondaparinux and @ to usual care ( unfractionated heparin or placebo ) , to assess LV systolic and diastolic function , LV mass , and LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes .
METHODS	A total of @ ( @ % ) patients were followed up for @ months and @ ( @ % ) for @ months .
METHODS	Major cardiac events ( MACE ) were defined as the composite of death , reinfarction , heart failure , or cardiogenic shock and resuscitated cardiac arrest .
RESULTS	Patients with LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) @ % and restrictive diastolic function ( RDF ) were at greatly increased risk of MACE ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- = @ , @ % CI , @ ) compared to patients with LVEF @ % and without RDF .
RESULTS	RDF remained a strong predictor for MACE in patients with LVEF @ % ( HR = @ , @ % CI , @ ) and in multivariate models adjusted for LVEF , LV end-systolic volume , and clinical variables .
CONCLUSIONS	In this large international trial , LV systolic and diastolic function , as determined by echocardiography early following STEMI , are incremental predictors of MACE .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , RDF is a strong independent predictor of MACE after STEMI across a broad range of LVEF .

BACKGROUND	The self-reported health and functional status of persons with back pain in the United States have declined in recent years , despite greatly increased medical expenditures due to this problem .
BACKGROUND	Although patient psychosocial factors such as pain-related beliefs , thoughts and coping behaviors have been demonstrated to affect how well patients respond to treatments for back pain , few patients receive treatments that address these factors .
BACKGROUND	Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which addresses psychosocial factors , has been found to be effective for back pain , but access to qualified therapists is limited .
BACKGROUND	Another treatment option with potential for addressing psychosocial issues , mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , is increasingly available .
BACKGROUND	MBSR has been found to be helpful for various mental and physical conditions , but it has not been well-studied for application with chronic back pain patients .
BACKGROUND	In this trial , we will seek to determine whether MBSR is an effective and cost-effective treatment option for persons with chronic back pain , compare its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared with CBT and explore the psychosocial variables that may mediate the effects of MBSR and CBT on patient outcomes .
METHODS	In this trial , we will randomize @ adults with nonspecific chronic back pain to CBT , MBSR or usual care arms ( @ per group ) .
METHODS	Both interventions will consist of eight weekly @-hour group sessions supplemented by home practice .
METHODS	The MBSR protocol also includes an optional @-hour retreat .
METHODS	Interviewers masked to treatment assignments will assess outcomes @ , @ , @ and @weeks postrandomization .
METHODS	The primary outcomes will be pain-related functional limitations ( based on the Roland Disability Questionnaire ) and symptom bothersomeness ( rated on a @ to @ numerical rating scale ) at @weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	If MBSR is found to be an effective and cost-effective treatment option for patients with chronic back pain , it will become a valuable addition to the limited treatment options available to patients with significant psychosocial contributors to their pain .

BACKGROUND	Endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response have been recently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel diseases in adults .
BACKGROUND	We aimed at assessing the involvement of these pathways also in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease by analysing the expression of the main genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and correlating them with the degree of intestinal inflammation .
METHODS	Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis of the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker HSPA@ and of selected genes representing the three pathways of unfolded protein response ( IRE-XBP@ , PERK-ATF@ , ATF@p@-p@ ) in inflamed and uninflamed biopsies from @ inflammatory bowel disease paediatric patients and @ controls .
RESULTS	HSPA@ , PDIA@ , as well as unspliced and spliced XBP@ mRNAs were significantly increased in patients ' inflamed colonic mucosa compared to uninflamed mucosa and controls .
RESULTS	HSPA@ , PDIA@ , ATF@ , and phospho-IRE proteins were also upregulated , indicating the activation of the IRE-XBP@ and ATF@p@-p@ branches of unfolded protein response .
RESULTS	A positive significant correlation between interleukin-@ levels , as a marker of inflammation , and upregulated genes was found in the inflamed colonic mucosa .
CONCLUSIONS	A deregulation of the genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways may be a key component of the inflammatory response in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease .

OBJECTIVE	CEREBEL compared the incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor @-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving lapatinib-capecitabine or trastuzumab-capecitabine .
METHODS	Patients without baseline CNS metastases were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive lapatinib-capecitabine ( lapatinib @,@ mg per day ; capecitabine @,@ mg/m ( @ ) per day on days @ to @ every @ days ) or trastuzumab-capecitabine ( trastuzumab loading dose of @ mg/kg followed by an infusion of @ mg/kg every @ weeks ; capecitabine @,@ mg/m ( @ ) per day on days @ to @ every @ days ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse .
METHODS	Secondary end points included progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
RESULTS	The study was terminated early with @ enrolled patients ( @ received lapatinib-capecitabine , and @ received trastuzumab-capecitabine ) .
RESULTS	Incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse was @ % ( eight of @ patients ) for lapatinib-capecitabine and @ % ( @ of @ patients ) for trastuzumab-capecitabine ( treatment differences , -@ % ; @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	PFS and OS were longer with trastuzumab-capecitabine versus lapatinib-capecitabine ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- for PFS , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; HR for OS , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events were reported in @ % ( @ of @ patients ) and @ % ( @ of @ patients ) of patients in the lapatinib-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine arms , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	CEREBEL is inconclusive for the primary end point , and no difference was detected between lapatinb-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine for the incidence of CNS metastases .
CONCLUSIONS	A better outcome was observed with trastuzumab-capecitabine in the overall population .
CONCLUSIONS	However , lapatinib-capecitabine efficacy may have been affected by previous exposure to a trastuzumab regimen and/or when treatment was given as first - or second-line therapy in the metastatic setting .

###24553304
OBJECTIVE	Factors underlying differential responsiveness to opioid analgesic medications used in chronic pain management are poorly understood .
OBJECTIVE	We tested whether individual differences in endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic low-back pain were associated with the magnitude of acute reductions in back pain ratings after morphine administration .
METHODS	In randomized counterbalanced order over three sessions , @ chronic low-back pain patients received intravenous naloxone ( @ mg ) , morphine ( @ mg/kg ) , or placebo .
METHODS	Back pain intensity was rated predrug and again after peak drug activity was achieved using the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form ( Sensory and Affective subscales , VAS Intensity measure ) .
METHODS	Opioid blockade effect measures to index degree of endogenous opioid inhibition of back pain intensity were derived as the difference between predrug to postdrug changes in pain intensity across placebo and naloxone conditions , with similar morphine responsiveness measures derived across placebo and morphine conditions .
RESULTS	Morphine significantly reduced back pain compared with placebo ( McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form Sensory , VAS ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no overall effects of opioid blockade on back pain intensity .
RESULTS	However , individual differences in opioid blockade effects were significantly associated with the degree of acute morphine-related reductions in back pain on all measures , even after controlling for effects of age , sex , and chronic pain duration ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Individuals exhibiting greater endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic back pain intensity reported less acute relief of back pain with morphine .
CONCLUSIONS	Morphine appears to provide better acute relief of chronic back pain in individuals with lower natural opioidergic inhibition of chronic pain intensity .
CONCLUSIONS	Possible implications for personalized medicine are discussed .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to examine a dynamic assessment with graduated prompts to assess morphological awareness and determine whether such a task was related to third-grade literacy success .
METHODS	A dynamic assessment of morphological awareness was adapted and administered to @ third-grade students in addition to a norm-referenced language and literacy battery .
RESULTS	A dynamic assessment of morphological awareness measured a range of performance including that of emerging morphological awareness abilities and provided rich linguistic insights for how best to scaffold and prompt for such a skill .
RESULTS	In addition , the dynamic morphological awareness measure was found to be significantly related to , and to contribute unique variance to , reading comprehension abilities .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that morphological awareness is an important factor to consider when addressing students ' literacy performance in early elementary school and that dynamic assessment appears to be a clinically valuable tool when examining early morphological awareness abilities .

OBJECTIVE	Ultrasound-guided long-axis in-plane sciatic perineural catheter insertion has been described but not validated .
OBJECTIVE	For the popliteal-sciatic nerve , we hypothesized that a long-axis in-plane technique , placing the catheter parallel and posterior to the nerve , results in faster onset of sensory anesthesia compared to a short-axis in-plane technique .
METHODS	Preoperatively , patients receiving a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter were randomly assigned to either the long-axis or short-axis technique .
METHODS	Mepivacaine @ % was administered via the catheter following insertion .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to achieve complete sensory anesthesia .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included procedural time , onset time of motor block , and pain on postoperative day @ .
RESULTS	Fifty patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	In the long-axis group ( n = @ ) , all patients except @ ( @ % ) had successful catheter placement per protocol .
RESULTS	Two patients ( @ % ) in the long-axis group and @ patient ( @ % ) in the short-axis group ( n = @ ) did not achieve sensory anesthesia by @ min and were withdrawn .
RESULTS	Seventeen of @ ( @ % ) and @ of @ ( @ % ) patients in the short-axis and long-axis groups , respectively , achieved the primary outcome of complete sensory anesthesia ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The short-axis group ( n = @ ) required a median ( @th-@th ) of @ ( @-@ @ ) min compared to @ ( @-@ @ ) min for the long-axis group ( n = @ , p = @ ) to achieve complete sensory anesthesia .
RESULTS	Procedural time was @ ( @-@ @ ) min for the short-axis and @ ( @-@ @ ) min for the long-axis ( p < @ ) group .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-axis in-plane popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter insertion requires more time to perform compared to a short-axis in-plane technique without demonstrating any advantages .

OBJECTIVE	Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) has been well documented , the gold standard for drug combination has not yet been established .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , the analgesic effects of six different drug combinations were compared .
METHODS	A total of @ patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were randomized into one of six groups : a control group ( saline solution , epinephrine , and cefazolin , n = @ ) , Group @ ( ropivacaine , n = @ ) , Group @ ( ropivacaine + morphine , n = @ ) , Group @ ( ropivacaine + ketorolac , n = @ ) , Group @ ( ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac , n = @ ) , and Group @ ( ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Pain level assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes .
METHODS	The incidence of complications , range of motion ( ROM ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) value , and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared .
RESULTS	Patients in Groups @ and @ complained less pain than the control group for the first @ h after surgery , and the patients in the other groups showed less pain only during the initial @ h after surgery .
RESULTS	Groups @ and @ also showed less opioid consumption than the control group during the @ h period after surgery .
RESULTS	Patients in Group @ showed no significant difference in VAS score and opioid consumption compared with Group @ , but they had lower CRP value and greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day @ and day @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of ropivacaine , morphine , and ketorolac showed a significantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without adding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinical relevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine , morphine , and ketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in terms of synergistic analgesic effect and efficiency of drug combination .

BACKGROUND	Secukinumab has demonstrated high , sustained efficacy in psoriasis to @ weeks on a fixed-interval regimen .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to compare a retreatment-as-needed versus a fixed-interval regimen .
METHODS	In this double-blind study , adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized @:@ to subcutaneous secukinumab at @ mg ( n = @ ) or @ mg ( n = @ ) weekly from baseline until week @ , and at week @ .
METHODS	At week @ , patients achieving @ % or more improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score ( PASI @ ) were rerandomized to @ dose levels of secukinumab retreatment as needed ( n = @ , @ mg ; n = @ , @ mg ) or fixed interval ( n = @ ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Primary end point was noninferiority of retreatment as needed versus fixed interval for maintaining PASI @ to week @ .
RESULTS	Secukinumab induced high responses by week @ ( @ % -@ % PASI @ responders ) .
RESULTS	From week @ to week @ , more patients on fixed interval ( @ % , @ mg ; @ % , @ mg ) maintained PASI @ versus retreatment as needed ( @ % ; @ % ) ; statistical noninferiority of retreatment as needed was not established .
RESULTS	Overall safety , including very low incidences of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies ( < @ % ) , was similar between regimens .
CONCLUSIONS	The primary end point was developed without any known precedent .
CONCLUSIONS	Secukinumab fixed interval showed clear benefit versus the study-specified retreatment-as-needed regimen for maintaining efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Both regimens exhibited safety consistent with previous trials .
CONCLUSIONS	The potential of retreatment as needed with secukinumab warrants further investigation .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to quantify the frequency and clinical severity of quality deficiencies in intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) planning in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group @ protocol .
METHODS	A total of @ IMRT patients from the high-dose arm ( @ Gy ) of RTOG @ were analyzed .
METHODS	To quantify plan quality , we used established knowledge-based methods for patient-specific dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) prediction of organs at risk and a Lyman-Kutcher-Burman ( LKB ) model for grade @ rectal complications to convert DVHs into normal tissue complication probabilities ( NTCPs ) .
METHODS	The LKB model was validated by fitting dose-response parameters relative to observed toxicities .
METHODS	The @th percentile ( @ of @ ) of plans with the lowest excess risk ( difference between clinical and model-predicted NTCP ) were used to create a model for the presumed best practices in the protocol ( pDVH@ , top@ % ) .
METHODS	Applying the resultant model to the entire sample enabled comparisons between DVHs that patients could have received to DVHs they actually received .
METHODS	Excess risk quantified the clinical impact of suboptimal planning .
METHODS	Accuracy of pDVH predictions was validated by replanning @ of @ patients ( @ % ) , including equal numbers of presumed `` high-quality , '' `` low-quality , '' and randomly sampled plans .
METHODS	NTCP-predicted toxicities were compared to adverse events on protocol .
RESULTS	Existing models showed that bladder-sparing variations were less prevalent than rectum quality variations and that increased rectal sparing was not correlated with target metrics ( dose received by @ % and @ % of the PTV , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Observed toxicities were consistent with current LKB parameters .
RESULTS	Converting DVH and pDVH@ , top@ % to rectal NTCPs , we observed @ of @ patients ( @ % ) with @ % excess risk , @ of @ patients ( @ % ) with @ % excess risk , and @ of @ patients ( @ % ) with @ % excess risk .
RESULTS	Replanning demonstrated the predicted NTCP reductions while maintaining the volume of the PTV receiving prescription dose .
RESULTS	An equivalent sample of high-quality plans showed fewer toxicities than low-quality plans , @ of @ versus @ of @ respectively , although these differences were not significant ( P = @ ) due to insufficient statistical power in this retrospective study .
CONCLUSIONS	Plan quality deficiencies in RTOG @ exposed patients to substantial excess risk for rectal complications .

BACKGROUND	Transfer patterns , procedure rates , and outcomes of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) presenting to Canadian community hospitals are not well understood .
METHODS	We documented all patients admitted to British Columbia ( BC ) hospitals with a primary diagnosis of NSTEMI between @ and @ .
METHODS	Patients were divided by admitting hospital type into tertiary care hospitals , nonremote community hospitals , and remote community hospitals .
METHODS	The aims were to compare transfer rates and time to transfer to a tertiary hospital as well as procedure rates and outcomes at index admission , at @ days , and at @ year .
RESULTS	The mean transfer rates to a tertiary hospital were @ % for nonremote and @ % for remote community hospitals ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Times to and rates of cardiac procedures differed significantly among these @ hospital types .
RESULTS	Admission to a nonremote or remote community hospital was associated with similar @-year mortality compared with admission to a tertiary care hospital ( nonremote hospitals , adjusted odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ ; P = @ ; remote hospitals , adjusted OR , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ year , admission to a nonremote community hospital was associated with a lower composite outcome of death or readmission for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ( adjusted OR , @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	One-year mortality rates were not different between patients with NSTEMI admitted to BC community and tertiary care hospitals ; however , the rate of readmission for AMI/death was significantly less in patients admitted to nonremote community hospitals .
CONCLUSIONS	This should prompt the evaluation of key outcomes in NSTEMI in other community hospital settings .

BACKGROUND	There is limited evidence supporting the podiatric treatment of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) .
BACKGROUND	This multicentre randomised controlled trial aimed to determine whether preformed foot orthoses ( FOs ) impacted on pain and quality of life ( QoL ) in children with JIA .
METHODS	Eligible children were randomised to receive either ` fitted ' FOs with customised chair-side corrections or ` control ' FOs made without corrections .
METHODS	Changes in pain and QoL were measured using a visual analogue scale and Paediatric Quality of Life questionnaire , respectively .
METHODS	JIA children were assessed at baseline , @ months and @ months .
RESULTS	@ children were recruited .
RESULTS	@ out of a possible @ assessments ( @ % ) were completed .
RESULTS	A statistically significant greater difference in pain reduction ( baseline - @ months ) was seen between the two groups favouring fitted FOs ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The reduction in pain in the fitted FOs group was clinically important ( @ mm ) .
RESULTS	Significant differences in QoL favouring fitted FOs were also identified as measured by the children and independently by their parents/carers .
CONCLUSIONS	Fitted FOs may reduce pain and improve QoL in selected children with JIA .

BACKGROUND	Edgewise fixed orthodontic appliances are available in two different bracket slot sizes ( @ and @ inch ) .
BACKGROUND	Both systems are used by clinicians worldwide with some orthodontists claiming the superiority and clinical advantages of one system over the other .
BACKGROUND	However , the scientific evidence supporting this area is scarce and weak .
BACKGROUND	This leaves the clinician 's choice of bracket slot system to clinical preference .
BACKGROUND	We aim to compare the @-inch and @-inch pre-adjusted bracket slot systems in terms of the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment .
METHODS	This is a prospective , multicenter , randomized clinical trial , undertaken in the secondary care hospital environment in the NHS Tayside region of Scotland ( United Kingdom ) .
METHODS	A total of @ orthodontic patients will be recruited in three centers in secondary care hospitals in NHS Tayside .
METHODS	The participants will be randomly allocated to treatment with either the @-inch or @-inch bracket slot systems ( n = @ for each group ) using Victory series conventional pre-adjusted bracket systems ( @ M Unitek , Monrovia , United States ) .
METHODS	Baseline records and outcome data collected during and at the end of orthodontic treatment will be assessed .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures will be the duration of orthodontic treatment in the maxillary and mandibular arches .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measures will be the number of scheduled appointments for orthodontic treatment in the maxillary and mandibular arches , treatment outcome using Peer Assessment Rating index ( PAR ) , orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption ( as measured using periapical radiographs ) and the patient 's perception of wearing orthodontic appliances .
CONCLUSIONS	The results from the current study will serve as evidence to guide the clinician in deciding whether the difference in bracket slot size has a significant impact on the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment .

OBJECTIVE	Compare the effectiveness of Papacarie gel for the chemo-mechanical removal of carious lesions on primary teeth to conventional caries removal with a low-speed bur with regard to execution time , clinical aspects and radiographic findings .
METHODS	A randomized controlled clinical trial with a split-mouth design was carried out .
METHODS	The sample was composed of @ children aged four to seven years , in whom @ deciduous teeth were randomly divided into two groups : chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie and removal of carious dentin with a low-speed bur .
METHODS	Each child underwent both procedures and served as his/her own control .
METHODS	Restorations were performed with glass ionomer cement .
METHODS	The time required to perform the procedure was also analyzed .
METHODS	The patients underwent longitudinal clinical and radiographic follow-up of the restorations .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference between groups was found regarding the time required to perform the procedures and the radiographic follow up .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences between groups were found in the clinical evaluation at @ and @ months after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Papacarie is as effective as the traditional method for the removal of carious dentin on deciduous teeth , but offers the advantages of the preservation of sound dental tissue as well as the avoidance of sharp rotary instruments and local anesthesia .

BACKGROUND	Treatment options for plantar fasciitis have resulted in varied patient outcomes .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare a novel treatment , cryopreserved human amniotic membrane ( c-hAM ) , to a traditional treatment , corticosteroid .
BACKGROUND	Our hypothesis was that c-hAM would be safe and comparable to corticosteroids for plantar fasciitis in regard to patient outcomes .
METHODS	A randomized , controlled , double-blind , single-center pilot study was completed .
METHODS	Patients were randomized into one of @ treatment groups : c-hAM or corticosteroid .
METHODS	Patients received an injection at their initial baseline visit with an option for a second injection at their first @-week follow-up .
METHODS	Total follow-up was obtained for @ weeks after the most recent injection .
METHODS	The primary outcome measurement was the Foot Health Status Questionnaire ( FHSQ ) .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measurements were the Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) and verbally reported percentage improvement .
METHODS	Data were analyzed between groups for the @ different cohorts ( @ injection versus @ injections ) .
METHODS	Twenty-three patients had complete follow-up .
METHODS	Fourteen were randomized to receive corticosteroid and @ were randomized to receive c-hAM .
RESULTS	Three patients in each group received second injections .
RESULTS	With the numbers available , the majority of outcome measurements showed no statistical difference between groups .
RESULTS	The corticosteroid did , however , have greater FHSQ shoe fit improvement ( P = @ ) at @ weeks , FHSQ general health improvement ( P = @ ) at @ weeks , and verbally reported improvement ( P = @ ) at @ weeks in the one-injection cohort .
RESULTS	Cryopreserved hAM had greater FHSQ foot pain improvement ( P = @ ) at @ weeks in the @-injection cohort .
CONCLUSIONS	Cryopreserved hAM injection may be safe and comparable to corticosteroid injection for treatment of plantar fasciitis .
CONCLUSIONS	This is a pilot study and requires further investigation .
METHODS	Level I , prospective randomized trial .

BACKGROUND	Placing a central venous access device via the internal jugular or subclavian vein entails significant risks to both patient and healthcare worker .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this randomized , prospective study was to determine whether the accelerated Seldinger technique ( AST ) offers significant safety advantages over the modified Seldinger technique ( MST ) for peripherally inserted central catheter insertion .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo introducer sheath insertion by means of either MST or AST .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures included time to completion of introducer sheath insertion , estimated blood loss , and success rate .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included vessel-to-air exposure events and unprotected sharps exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	While both insertion methods proved equivalent for successful vessel cannulation , AST was significantly faster ( P = @ ) and resulted in less blood loss ( P = @ ) than MST .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , AST resulted in significantly fewer vessel-to-air exposure events ( P < @ ) and unprotected sharps exposures ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this was a relatively small and unblinded study , the high degree of statistical significance of the study results suggests that , for both patients and healthcare workers , AST is faster and safer than MST for PICC peelable introducer sheath insertion .

OBJECTIVE	A significant proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond adequately to biologic treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that lack of response to ( biologic ) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) is high in patients in whom the subjective , patient-reported component of the Disease Activity Score @ ( DAS@ ) is high at baseline .
OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of our present study was to investigate the contribution of the more subjective versus the objective components of the DAS@ to response to biologic agents in RA patients , as well as the changes in this contribution over time .
OBJECTIVE	The secondary aim was to examine whether the value of this subjective contribution at baseline affects the response to treatment .
METHODS	The DAS@-P ( the subjective components of the DAS@ relative to the total DAS@ ) was calculated .
METHODS	Patients were derived from the computer-assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial-II and the Biologicals and Outcome Compared and Predicted in Utrecht Region in Rheumatoid Arthritis Study .
METHODS	Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed .
RESULTS	The DAS@-P score at baseline was not associated with the level of response according to European League Against Rheumatism criteria at @ months .
RESULTS	Overall , a significant reduction in the DAS@-P score was observed @ months after start of treatment , showing a greater reduction of the combined subjective components in good responders .
CONCLUSIONS	The results reject the hypothesis that the lack of response to biologic DMARDs is especially high in patients in whom the patient-reported component of the DAS@ is high at baseline ; these subjective components are not linked to treatment response .

BACKGROUND	Coordination between breathing and swallowing helps prevent aspiration of foreign material into the respiratory tract .
BACKGROUND	The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination .
METHODS	In a randomized controlled crossover study , general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm .
METHODS	Additional measurements included bispectral index , genioglossus electromyogram , ventilation ( pneumotachometer ) , and hypopharyngeal pressure .
METHODS	During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia , carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by @ and @ mmHg .
METHODS	A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure .
METHODS	Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological ( during expiration or followed by expiration ) or pathological ( during inspiration or followed by an inspiration ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ swallows were analyzed .
RESULTS	Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows ( @ % vs. @ % ) and decreased the number of swallows per hour ( @ vs. @ ) compared to wakefulness .
RESULTS	During anesthesia , hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration ( -@ vs. -@ mmHg ) and increased minute ventilation , the proportion of pathological swallows ( @ % vs. @ % ) , and the number of swallows per hour ( @ .
RESULTS	vs. @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration .
CONCLUSIONS	Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing .
CONCLUSIONS	During anesthesia , the risk for aspiration may be further increased when ventilatory drive is stimulated .

BACKGROUND	In ruminants , lower ruminal pH causes massive disruption of ruminal epithelial structure during periods of feeding high-concentrate diets .
BACKGROUND	However , the influence of excessive organic fatty acids in the lumen of hindgut on the epithelial structure is unclear .
BACKGROUND	In this study , twelve mid-lactating goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group ( @ % concentrate of dry matter ; n = @ ) or a LC diet group ( @ % concentrate of dry matter ; n = @ ) for @ weeks .
BACKGROUND	The colonic epithelial structure was detected by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and the apoptotic status of epithelial cells was estimated by TUNEL method and caspase activities .
RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of free lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in rumen fluid ( p < @ ) but not in colonic digesta ( p > @ ) , and higher total volatile fatty acid ( VFA ) concentrations in rumen fluid ( p < @ ) and in colonic digesta ( p < @ ) , and higher content of starch in colonic digesta ( p < @ ) compared to LC goats .
RESULTS	HC goats demonstrated profound alterations in the colonic epithelial structure and tight junctions ( TJ ) , apparently due to damage of the epithelium with widened TJs space and nuclear breakdown and mitochondrial swelling .
RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of apoptosis in the colonic epithelium with higher proportion of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and increases of caspase-@ and -@ / @ activities , as well as the lower ratio of bcl-@ / bax mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , - defense mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa of HC goats compared to LC ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of TJ proteins including claudin-@ and claudin-@ in the colonic mucosa than LC ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Neither free LPS content in the colonic digesta nor NF - B protein expression in tissues showed significant difference between HC and LC goats ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results reveal that long-term feeding HC diet to lactating goats causes severe damages to the colonic mucosa barrier associated with activating cells apoptosis .

BACKGROUND	Earlier kinetics of serum HCV core antigen ( HCVcAg ) and its predictive value on sustained virological response ( SVR ) were investigated in patients with genotype @ HCV infection during antiviral treatment .
METHODS	In a multi-centered , randomized and positive drug-controlled phase IIb clinical trial on type Y peginterferon -@ b ( NCT@ ) , forty-eight CHC patients who participated in pharmacokinetics were randomly divided into @ cohorts and treated with PegIFN ( type Y peginterferon -@ b @ g , @ g , @ g and PegIFN-@a @ g , respectively , once a week ) and ribavirin ( < @ kg , @ mg daily and@ kg , @ mg daily ) for @ weeks , and then followed up for @ weeks .
METHODS	@ patients infected with genotype @ HCV and completed the whole process were included in this study .
METHODS	HCV RNAs were detected at baseline , and weeks @ , @ , @ , @ and @ using Cobas TaqMan .
METHODS	ARCHITECT HCVcAg was performed at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ h in addition to the above time points .
METHODS	The receiver operating curves ( ROCs ) were performed to study the predictive values of HCVcAg decline on SVR .
RESULTS	Following antiviral treatment , serum HCVcAg levels rapidly declined within the first week and correlated well with corresponding HCV RNA at baseline , weeks @ , @ , @ , @ and @ ( rs = @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ , respectively , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	All of the areas under the receiver operating curves ( AUROCs ) were more than @ and showed good predictive power on SVR at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ h. The@ h was the best predictive time point of HCVcAg decline on SVR because of its largest AUROC ( more than @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Early kinetics of serum HCVcAg predicts SVR very well in genotype @ CHC patients during antiviral treatment , and its reduction value at @ h is an earlier and stronger predictor on SVR than rapid virological response and early virological response .
CONCLUSIONS	( TRN : NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	The pectoral nerves ( Pecs ) block types I and II are novel techniques to block the pectoral , intercostobrachial , third to sixth intercostals , and the long thoracic nerves .
BACKGROUND	They may provide good analgesia during and after breast surgery .
BACKGROUND	Our study aimed to compare prospectively the quality of analgesia after modified radical mastectomy surgery using general anesthesia and Pecs blocks versus general anesthesia alone .
METHODS	One hundred twenty adult female patients scheduled for elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either general anesthesia plus Pecs block ( Pecs group , n = @ ) or general anesthesia alone ( control group , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Statistically significant lower visual analog scale pain scores were observed in the Pecs group than in the control group patients .
RESULTS	Moreover , postoperative morphine consumption in the Pecs group was lower in the first @ hours after surgery than in the control group .
RESULTS	In addition , statistically significant lower intraoperative fentanyl consumption was observed in the Pecs group than in the control group .
RESULTS	In the postanesthesia care unit , nausea and vomiting as well as sedation scores were lower in the Pecs group compared with the control group .
RESULTS	Overall , postanesthesia care unit and hospital stays were shorter in the Pecs group than in the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The combined Pecs I and II block is a simple , easy-to-learn technique that produces good analgesia for radical breast surgery .

BACKGROUND	Verbal autopsy ( VA ) has been proposed to determine the cause of death ( COD ) distributions in settings where most deaths occur without medical attention or certification .
BACKGROUND	We develop performance criteria for VA-based COD systems and apply these to the Registrar General of India 's ongoing , nationally-representative Indian Million Death Study ( MDS ) .
METHODS	Performance criteria include a low ill-defined proportion of deaths before old age ; reproducibility , including consistency of COD distributions with independent resampling ; differences in COD distribution of hospital , home , urban or rural deaths ; age - , sex - and time-specific plausibility of specific diseases ; stability and repeatability of dual physician coding ; and the ability of the mortality classification system to capture a wide range of conditions .
RESULTS	The introduction of the MDS in India reduced the proportion of ill-defined deaths before age @ years from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	The cause-specific mortality fractions ( CSMFs ) at ages @ to @ years for independently resampled deaths and the MDS were very similar across @ disease categories .
RESULTS	By contrast , CSMFs at these ages differed between hospital and home deaths and between urban and rural deaths .
RESULTS	Thus , reliance mostly on urban or hospital data can distort national estimates of CODs .
RESULTS	Age - , sex - and time-specific patterns for various diseases were plausible .
RESULTS	Initial physician agreement on COD occurred about two-thirds of the time .
RESULTS	The MDS COD classification system was able to capture more eligible records than alternative classification systems .
RESULTS	By these metrics , the Indian MDS performs well for deaths prior to age @ years .
RESULTS	The key implication for low - and middle-income countries where medical certification of death remains uncommon is to implement COD surveys that randomly sample all deaths , use simple but high-quality field work with built-in resampling , and use electronic rather than paper systems to expedite field work and coding .
CONCLUSIONS	Simple criteria can evaluate the performance of VA-based COD systems .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the misclassification of VA , the MDS demonstrates that national surveys of CODs using VA are an order of magnitude better than the limited COD data previously available .

BACKGROUND	Depression accounts for the greatest disease burden of all mental health disorders , contributes heavily to healthcare costs , and by @ is set to become the second largest cause of global disability .
BACKGROUND	Although @ % to @ % of people aged @ years and over are likely to experience depressive symptoms , the condition is under-diagnosed and often inadequately treated in primary care .
BACKGROUND	Later-life depression is associated with chronic illness and disability , cognitive impairment and social isolation .
BACKGROUND	With a progressively ageing population it becomes increasingly important to refine strategies to identity and manage depression in older people .
BACKGROUND	Currently , management may be limited to the prescription of antidepressants where there may be poor concordance ; older people may lack awareness of psychosocial interventions and general practitioners may neglect to offer this treatment option .
METHODS	CASPER Plus is a multi-centre , randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care intervention for individuals aged @ years and over experiencing moderate to severe depression .
METHODS	Selected practices in the North of England identify potentially eligible patients and invite them to participate in the study .
METHODS	A diagnostic interview is carried out and participants with major depressive disorder are randomised to either collaborative care or usual care .
METHODS	The recruitment target is @ participants .
METHODS	The intervention , behavioural activation and medication management in a collaborative care framework , has been adapted to meet the complex needs of older people .
METHODS	It is delivered over eight to @ weekly sessions by a case manager liaising with general practitioners .
METHODS	The trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of collaborative care in addition to usual GP care versus usual GP care alone .
METHODS	The primary clinical outcome , depression severity , will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-@ ( PHQ-@ ) at baseline , @ , @ and @ months .
METHODS	Cost effectiveness analysis will assess health-related quality of life using the SF-@ and EQ-@D and will examine cost-consequences of collaborative care .
METHODS	A qualitative process evaluation will be undertaken to explore acceptability , gauge the extent to which the intervention is implemented and to explore sustainability beyond the clinical trial .
CONCLUSIONS	Results will add to existing evidence and a positive outcome may lead to the commissioning of this model of service in primary care .

BACKGROUND	Endoscopic placement of a iodine-@ radioactive stent is useful to treat obstructive jaundice with unresectable periampullary tumors .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the obstructive component of biliary radioactive stents and discuss the different obstructive mechanism with common plastic stents .
METHODS	Twenty consecutive patients with malignant obstruction underwent insertion of stents into the common bile duct , including @ radioactive stents and @ polyethylene stents .
METHODS	The radioactive stents were withdrawn after @ months or earlier if clinical signs suggested stent clogging .
METHODS	Polyethylene stents were withdrawn after physical signs suggested stent clogging .
METHODS	Bacteriologic analyses included identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria .
METHODS	Stent surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy .
METHODS	Stent deposition was identified by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis derivatization/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry .
RESULTS	Radioactive stent group and polyethylene stent group stents were placed for @ days ( interquartile range @ , @ ) and @ days ( interquartile range @ , @ ) respectively .
RESULTS	The placement duration of the two types of stents was statistically significant .
RESULTS	A variety of microorganisms were cultured from the stent deposits .
RESULTS	Scanning electron microscope images showed a thicker necrotic layer on the external surface of polyethylene stent than the radioactive stent group .
RESULTS	The proportions of obstructive components in each stent were different , but none of them were statistically significant .
RESULTS	Necrotic tumor tissue was found in the radioactive stent group .
CONCLUSIONS	Similar clogging events occurred in both radioactive stents and polyethylene stents .
CONCLUSIONS	The median duration time of the radioactive stent was shorter , probably because of the smaller inner diameter , and the radioactive seeds exerted no beneficial effect in inhibiting microorganisms .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies on cognitive and interpersonal interventions have yielded inconsistent results in ischemic heart disease patients .
METHODS	@ patients aged @ years , and enrolled one week after complete revascularization with urgent/emergent angioplasty for an AMI , were randomized to standard cardiological therapy plus short-term humanistic-existential psychotherapy ( STP ) versus standard cardiological therapy only .
METHODS	Primary composite end point was : one-year incidence of new cardiological events ( re-infarction , death , stroke , revascularization , life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias , and the recurrence of typical and clinically significant angina ) and of clinically significant new comorbidities .
METHODS	Secondary end points were : rates for individual components of the primary outcome , incidence of re-hospitalizations for cardiological problems , New York Heart Association class , and psychometric test scores at follow-up .
RESULTS	@ patients were analyzed at one year .
RESULTS	The two treatment groups were similar across all baseline characteristics .
RESULTS	At follow-up , STP patients had had a lower incidence of the primary endpoint , relative to controls ( @/@ vs. @/@ patients ; p = @ , respectively ; NNT = @ ) ; this benefit was attributable to the lower incidence of recurrent angina and of new comorbidities in the STP group ( @/@ vs. @/@ patients , p = @ , NNT = @ ; and @/@ vs. @/@ , p < @ , NNT = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Patients undergoing STP also had statistically fewer re-hospitalizations , a better NYHA class , higher quality of life , and lower depression scores .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding STP to cardiological therapy improves cardiological symptoms , quality of life , and psychological and medical outcomes one year post AMI , while reducing the need for re-hospitalizations .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger studies remain necessary to confirm the generalizability of these results .

BACKGROUND	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated an adjuvanted bivalent intramuscular norovirus virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine .
METHODS	Forty-eight adults aged @-@ years received either @ doses containing genotype GI @ VLP and a consensus GII @ VLP or @ doses of placebo .
METHODS	Doses ( @ g , @ g , @ g , or @ g of each VLP ) were administered @ weeks apart in the first stage .
METHODS	Subsequently , @ adults , aged @-@ ( n = @ ) , @-@ ( n = @ ) , and @-@ ( n = @ ) years , received @ doses of vaccine containing @ g of each VLP .
METHODS	Total and class-specific antibody responses , as well as histoblood group antigen ( HBGA ) blocking antibody responses , were measured before and after each dose .
RESULTS	Local reactions were mainly injection site pain/tenderness , with no reported fever or vaccine-related serious adverse events .
RESULTS	One dose of vaccine containing @ g of each VLP increased GI @ geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) by @-fold , @-fold , and @-fold and increased GII @ GMTs by @-fold , @-fold , and @-fold in subjects aged @-@ , @-@ , and @-@ years , respectively .
RESULTS	Serum antibody responses peaked at day @ after the first dose , with no evidence of boosting following a second dose .
RESULTS	Most subjects achieved HBGA-blocking antibody titers of @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic .
CONCLUSIONS	Rapid immune response to a single dose may be particularly useful in military personnel and travelers and in the control of outbreaks .

BACKGROUND	The threshold values of rapid shallow breathing index ( RSBI ) were compared in pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) and T-piece assessments for spontaneous breathing trials ( SBT ) .
BACKGROUND	The ability of RSBI to also predict successful weaning was evaluated .
METHODS	Two hundred eight patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation through oral intubation .
METHODS	They were randomly divided into PSV group ( n = @ ) and T-piece group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The RSBI was calculated as f/VT at SBT of @ and @ minutes .
METHODS	Receiver operating characteristic curves of RSBI were also generated , cutoff values were determined and the changes in the RSBI were calculated .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients , @ ( @ % ) were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation , @/@ ( @ % ) in the PSV group and @/@ ( @ % ) in the T-piece group ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	In the PSV and T-piece groups , the average RSBI at @-minute SBT was @ @ breaths per min/L and @ @ breaths per min/L , respectively ( P < @ ) , and the average RSBI was @ @ % and @ @ % , respectively ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Additionally , in the @ groups , an RSBI of @ breaths per min/L ( PSV ) and @ breaths per min/L ( T-piece ) yielded a diagnostic accuracy of @ % and @ % respectively .
RESULTS	However , a RSBI of @ % ( PSV ) and @ % ( T-piece ) yielded a diagnostic accuracy of @ % and @ % respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	The threshold values of RSBI , thus @ breaths per min/L ( PSV ) and @ breaths per min/L ( T-piece ) , for predicting successful weaning were more accurate than other values .
CONCLUSIONS	Similarly , the change in the RSBI could also predict such successes .

BACKGROUND	Continuous long-term treatment with nitrates may cause nitrate tolerance .
BACKGROUND	Nebivolol is a highly selective beta@-adrenergic antagonist with additional nitric oxide ( NO ) - mediated vasodilatory effects .
BACKGROUND	However , there have been no investigations into whether or not the long-term administration of nebivolol might cause nitrate tolerance .
METHODS	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study in @ healthy men .
METHODS	Subjects received @ mg nebivolol or placebo once daily for @ days in random order divided by a drug-free interval of @ weeks .
METHODS	Forearm blood flow ( FBF ) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography @ h after oral intake of the first and last doses of nebivolol and placebo , respectively .
METHODS	FBF was measured again following the intravenous administration of @ g nitroglycerin/kg body weight/min for @ min .
RESULTS	Following @ days of continuous intake of placebo , nitroglycerin increased FBF by @ % ( p < @ ) , whereas nitroglycerin increased FBF by @ % ( p < @ ) following @ days of continuous intake of nebivolol , and the increase after @ days of nebivolol was significantly ( p < @ ) more pronounced than after @ days of placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings indicate no evidence of nitrate tolerance caused by long-term administration of nebivolol .
CONCLUSIONS	On the contrary , long-term intake of nebivolol increases rather than decreases the NO-mediated vasodilating effects .

OBJECTIVE	Ninety percent of cases of acute calculous cholecystitis are of mild ( grade I ) or moderate ( grade II ) severity .
OBJECTIVE	Although the preoperative and intraoperative antibiotic management of acute calculous cholecystitis has been standardized , few data exist on the utility of postoperative antibiotic treatment .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of postoperative amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid on infection rates after cholecystectomy .
METHODS	A total of @ patients treated at @ medical centers for grade I or II acute calculous cholecystitis and who received @ g of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid @ times a day while in the hospital before and once at the time of surgery were randomized after surgery to an open-label , noninferiority , randomized clinical trial between May @ and August @ .
METHODS	After surgery , no antibiotics or continue with the preoperative antibiotic regimen @ times daily for @ days .
METHODS	The proportion of postoperative surgical site or distant infections recorded before or at the @-week follow-up visit .
RESULTS	An imputed intention-to-treat analysis of @ patients showed that the postoperative infection rates were @ % ( @ of @ ) in the nontreatment group and @ % ( @ of @ ) in the antibiotic group ( absolute difference , @ % ; @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis , which involved @ patients , the corresponding rates were both @ % ( absolute difference , @ % ; @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Based on a noninferiority margin of @ % , the lack of postoperative antibiotic treatment was not associated with worse outcomes than antibiotic treatment .
RESULTS	Bile cultures showed that @ % were pathogen free .
RESULTS	Both groups had similar Clavien complication severity outcomes : @ patients ( @ % ) in the nontreatment group had a score of @ to I and @ patients ( @ % ) had a score of III to V , and @ patients ( @ % ) in the antibiotic group had a score of @ to I and @ patients ( @ % ) had a score of III to V.
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with mild or moderate calculous cholecystitis who received preoperative and intraoperative antibiotics , lack of postoperative treatment with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid did not result in a greater incidence of postoperative infections .

OBJECTIVE	Women in academic medicine are not achieving the same career advancement as men , and face unique challenges in managing work and family alongside intense work demands .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate how a supportive department/division culture buffered women from the impact of work demands on work-to-family conflict .
METHODS	As part of a larger intervention trial , the authors collected baseline survey data from @ women assistant professors at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in @ .
METHODS	Validated measures of work demands , work-to-family conflict , and a department/division culture were employed .
METHODS	Pearson correlations and general linear mixed modeling were used to analyze the data .
METHODS	Authors investigated whether work culture moderated the association between work demands and work-to-family conflict .
RESULTS	Heavy work demands were associated with increased levels of work-to-family conflict .
RESULTS	There were significant interactions between work demands , work-to-family conflict , and department/division culture .
RESULTS	A culture conducive to women 's academic success significantly moderated the effect of work hours on time-based work-to-family conflict and significantly moderated the effect of work overload on strain-based work-to-family conflict .
RESULTS	At equivalent levels of work demands , women in more supportive cultures experienced lower levels of work-to-family conflict .
CONCLUSIONS	The culture of the department/division plays a crucial role in women 's work-to-family conflict and can exacerbate or alleviate the impact of extremely high work demands .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding leads to important insights about strategies for more effectively supporting the careers of women assistant professors .

BACKGROUND	Little is known about how different antiretrovirals effect inflammation and monocyte activation in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection .
METHODS	We examined plasma specimens obtained during a randomized , double-blinded trial in antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) - naive HIV-infected adults which compared the efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( EVG/c/FTC / TDF ) with that of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( EFV/FTC/TDF ) .
METHODS	From a random sample achieving an HIV type @ RNA load of < @ copies/mL by week @ , changes over @ and @ weeks in levels of biomarkers of monocyte activation ( soluble CD@ -LSB- sCD@ -RSB- and soluble CD@ -LSB- sCD@ -RSB- ) , systemic inflammation ( soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I -LSB- sTNF-RI -RSB- , interleukin @ -LSB- IL-@ -RSB- , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein -LSB- hsCRP -RSB- ) , and vascular inflammation ( lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A@ -LSB- Lp-PLA@ -RSB- ) were compared .
METHODS	Multivariable linear regression was used .
RESULTS	A total of @ participants were included .
RESULTS	Significant differences favoring EVG/c/FTC / TDF were noted for changes in sCD@ , hsCRP , and Lp-PLA@ levels .
RESULTS	Factors independently associated with a larger decrease in the sCD@ level included random assignment to receive EVG/c/FTC / TDF , higher baseline sCD@ level , and larger decreases in hsCRP and sCD@ levels ; factors associated with a larger Lp-PLA@ decrease included higher baseline Lp-PLA@ and IL-@ levels , smaller increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides levels , a larger decrease in the sCD@ level , and a smaller decrease in the sCD@ level .
CONCLUSIONS	EVG/c/FTC / TDF led to greater decreases in sCD@ , hsCRP , and Lp-PLA@ levels , compared with EFV/FTC/TDF .
CONCLUSIONS	Randomization group independently predicted the change in sCD@ level , and changes in monocyte activation independently predicted the change in Lp-PLA@ level .
CONCLUSIONS	There appears to be a more favorable effect of the integrase inhibitor EVG over efavirenz on immune activation , which may affect vascular inflammation .

BACKGROUND	Vitamin D supplementation may be an inexpensive intervention to reduce heart failure ( HF ) incidence .
BACKGROUND	However , there are insufficient data to support this hypothesis .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluates whether vitamin D plus calcium ( CaD ) supplementation is associated with lower rates of HF in postmenopausal women and whether the effects differ between those at high versus low risk for HF .
RESULTS	Analyses were restricted to @ @ ( of original @ @ ) women aged @ to @ years old in the Women 's Health Initiative randomized trial of CaD supplementation who were randomized @:@ in a double-blinded fashion to receive @ mg/d of calcium plus @ IU/d of vitamin D@ or placebo .
RESULTS	Overall , @ adjudicated incident HF cases ( intervention , @ ; control , @ ) occurred during a median follow-up of @ ( interquartile range , @ ) years .
RESULTS	CaD supplementation , compared with placebo , was not associated with reduced HF risk in the overall population , hazard ratio , @ ; P = @ .
RESULTS	However , CaD supplementation had differential effects ( P interaction = @ ) in subgroups stratified by baseline risk status of HF defined by the presence ( high risk = @ @ ) or absence ( low risk = @ @ ) of pre-existing HF precursors including coronary heart diseases , diabetes mellitus , or hypertension : @ % ( hazard ratio , @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ) lower risk of HF in the low-risk versus hazard ratio , @ ; P = @ , in the high-risk subgroups .
CONCLUSIONS	CaD supplementation did not significantly reduce HF incidence in the overall cohort , however , it was beneficial among postmenopausal women without major HF precursors while of little value in high-risk subgroups .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanism .

BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomized phase III trial of first-line NPLD plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel ( Pharmachemie B.V. ) ( MTP ) versus trastuzumab plus paclitaxel ( TP ) in patients with human epidermal growth factor @ receptor ( HER@ ) - positive metastatic breast cancer .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to NPLD ( M , @ mg/m ( @ ) every @ weeks for six cycles ) , trastuzumab ( T , @ mg/kg loading dose followed by @ mg/kg weekly ) , and paclitaxel ( P , @ mg/m ( @ ) weekly ) or T + P at the same doses until progression or toxicity .
METHODS	The primary efficacy outcome was progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
RESULTS	One hundred and eighty-one patients were allocated to receive MTP , and @ to TP .
RESULTS	Median PFS was @ and @ months with MTP and TP , respectively -LSB- hazard ratio ( HR ) @ ; two-sided P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	In patients with estrogen receptor ( ER ) - and progesterone receptor ( PR ) - negative tumors , PFS was @ and @ months , respectively -LSB- HR @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	Median overall survival ( OS ) was @ and @ months with MTP and TP , respectively ( HR @ ; two-sided P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In ER - and PR-negative tumors , OS was @ and @ months , respectively ( HR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The frequency of adverse events was higher with MTP , but there was no significant difference in cardiac toxicity between treatment arms .
CONCLUSIONS	The trial failed to demonstrate a significant clinical improvement with the addition of M to TP regimen .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinical benefit observed in an exploratory analysis in the ER - and PR-negative population deserves consideration for further clinical trials .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of reflex entropy ( RE ) / state entropy ( SE ) in monitoring the response to nociceptive stimulus during propofol-remifentanil infusion .
METHODS	After the approval of the hospital ethics committee , sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification @-@ patients , aged @-@ years , receiving the hypogastrium operation undergoing general anesthesia , were randomly allocated to groups A and B with different remifentanil concentrations .
METHODS	After the concentration of propofol and remifentanil reached balance , tetanic stimulation , intubation , and incision were performed respectively with certain intervals .
METHODS	RE and SE were monitored during this procedure .
RESULTS	Twelve patients were withdrawn from this study due to the use of vasoactive drugs .
RESULTS	Finally , there were @ cases in group A and @ cases in group B.
RESULTS	The RE and SE were not significantly changed before and after the tetanic stimulation in both groups ( all P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Both RE and SE were significantly increased after intubation in group B ( both P < @ ) and after skin incision in both groups ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Under the same stimulation , RE and SE showed no significant difference among groups administered with different levels of remifentanil ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Under the anesthesia with propofol + remifentanil , nociceptive response may cause the increase of RE and SE .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , RE and SE may be useful parameters for monitoring the nociceptive response during general anaesthesia .

OBJECTIVE	Vent-HeFT is a multicentre randomized trial designed to investigate the potential additive benefits of inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) on aerobic training ( AT ) in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) .
RESULTS	Forty-three CHF patients with a mean age of @ years , peak oxygen consumption ( peak VO@ ) @ mL/kg/min , and LVEF @ % were randomized to an AT/IMT group ( n = @ ) or to an AT/SHAM group ( n = @ ) in a @-week exercise programme .
RESULTS	AT involved @ min of ergometer training at @-@ % of maximum heart rate , three times a week for both groups .
RESULTS	In the AT/IMT group , IMT was performed at @ % of sustained maximal inspiratory pressure ( SPImax ) while in the AT/SHAM group it was performed at @ % of SPImax , using a computer biofeedback trainer for @ min , three times a week .
RESULTS	At baseline and at @ months , patients were evaluated for exercise capacity , lung function , inspiratory muscle strength ( PImax ) and work capacity ( SPImax ) , quality of life ( QoL ) , LVEF and LV diameter , dyspnoea , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and NT-proBNP .
RESULTS	IMT resulted in a significantly higher benefit in SPImax ( P = @ ) , QoL ( P = @ ) , dyspnoea ( P = @ ) , CRP ( P = @ ) , and NT-proBNP ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In both AT/IMT and AT/SHAM groups PImax ( P < @ , P = @ ) , peak VO@ ( P = @ , P = @ ) , and LVEF ( P = @ , P = @ ) improved significantly ; however , without an additional benefit for either of the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This randomized multicentre study demonstrates that IMT combined with aerobic training provides additional benefits in functional and serum biomarkers in patients with moderate CHF .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings advocate for application of IMT in cardiac rehabilitation programmes .

BACKGROUND	Anaesthetists may fail to recognize and manage certain rare intraoperative events .
BACKGROUND	Simulation has been shown to be an effective educational adjunct to typical operating room-based education to train for these events .
BACKGROUND	It is yet unclear , however , why simulation has any benefit .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that learners who are allowed to manage a scenario independently and allowed to fail , thus causing simulated morbidity , will consequently perform better when re-exposed to a similar scenario .
METHODS	Using a randomized , controlled , observer-blinded design , @ first-year residents were exposed to an oxygen pipeline contamination scenario , either where patient harm occurred ( independent group , n = @ ) or where a simulated attending anaesthetist intervened to prevent harm ( supervised group , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Residents were brought back @ months later and exposed to a different scenario ( pipeline contamination ) with the same end point .
METHODS	Participants ' proper treatment , time to diagnosis , and non-technical skills ( measured using the Anaesthetists ' Non-Technical Skills Checklist , ANTS ) were measured .
RESULTS	No participants provided proper treatment in the initial exposure .
RESULTS	In the repeat encounter @ months later , @ % in the independent group vs @ % in the supervised group resumed adequate oxygen delivery ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The independent group also had better ANTS scores -LSB- median ( interquartile range ) : @ ( @-@ @ ) vs @ ( @-@ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	There was no difference in time to treatment if proper management was provided -LSB- @ ( @-@ ) vs @ ( @-@ ) s , P = @ -RSB- .
CONCLUSIONS	Allowing residents to practise independently in the simulation laboratory , and subsequently , allowing them to fail , can be an important part of simulation-based learning .
CONCLUSIONS	This is not feasible in real clinical practice but appears to have improved resident performance in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	The purposeful use of independent practice and its potentially negative outcomes thus sets simulation-based learning apart from traditional operating room learning .

OBJECTIVE	Veliparib ( ABT-@ ) is a potent oral inhibitor of Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase enzyme that is currently in development for the treatment of non-hematologic and hematologic malignancies .
OBJECTIVE	This analysis characterizes the population pharmacokinetics of veliparib , including developing a structural pharmacokinetic model and testing patient demographics and covariates for potential influence on veliparib pharmacokinetics in patients with non-hematologic malignancies .
METHODS	The analysis dataset included @,@ veliparib concentration values from @ patients with non-hematologic malignancies enrolled in three phase I and one phase II studies .
METHODS	Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using NONMEM .
METHODS	The likelihood ratio test was used for comparison of nested models , and visual predictive check was employed for model qualification .
METHODS	Covariates tested included body size measures , creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) , formulation , age , sex , race , liver function tests , and coadministration with temozolomide .
RESULTS	A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described veliparib pharmacokinetics .
RESULTS	The final model included fixed effects for CLCR on veliparib oral clearance ( CL/F ) and lean body mass ( LBM ) on volume of distribution ( V d/F ) .
RESULTS	CL/F and V d/F were @ L/h ( for a CLCR of @ mL/min ) and @ L ( for an LBM of @ kg ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Only LBM and CLCR were found to be determinants of veliparib V d/F and CL/F , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Dosage adjustments of veliparib on the basis of body size , age , sex , race , liver function , and temozolomide coadministration are not necessary in patients with non-hematologic malignancies .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of veliparib , and the developed model will be used to conduct simulations and evaluate veliparib exposure-response relationships .

METHODS	The primary endpoint in the current analysis was the self reported effects and overall adverse impact of the Christchurch earthquakes as assessed by questionnaire four months after the most destructive earthquake on @ February @ , which was used as the index event .
METHODS	The secondary end point was the number of `` psychological '' adverse events that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments as part of the original VIDARIS trial .
RESULTS	@ participants completed the earthquake impact questionnaire ( n = @ in the vitamin D group and @ in the placebo group ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the number of self reported adverse effects between those receiving vitamin D supplementation and those receiving placebo .
RESULTS	There was also no difference in the overall adverse impact score between treatment groups ( ( @ ) P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The exception was that those in the vitamin D group experienced more adverse effects on family relationships ( @ % v @ % ; ( @ ) P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of psychological adverse events-such as fatigue , stress , anxiety , and insomnia-that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments was significantly higher after the earthquake ( ( @ ) P = @ ) but did not differ between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In this trial , vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the adverse impact of earthquakes in healthy adults .

BACKGROUND	Patients with transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) or stroke are at risk for cognitive impairment and dementia .
BACKGROUND	Currently , there is no known effective strategy to prevent this cognitive decline .
BACKGROUND	Increasing evidence exists that physical exercise is beneficial for cognitive function .
BACKGROUND	However , in patients with TIA or stroke who are at risk of cognitive impairment and dementia , only a few trials have been conducted .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we aim to investigate whether a physical exercise programme ( MoveIT ) can prevent cognitive decline in patients in the acute phase after a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke .
METHODS	A single-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise programme on cognition compared with usual care .
METHODS	@ adult patients with a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke less than @ month ago will be randomly allocated to an exercise programme consisting of a @-week aerobic exercise programme and regular follow-up visits to a specialised physiotherapist during the period of @ year or to usual care .
METHODS	Outcome measures will be assessed at the baseline , and at the @-year and @-year follow-up .
METHODS	The primary outcome is cognitive functioning measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) test and with additional neuropsychological tests .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include maximal exercise capacity , self-reported physical activity and measures of secondary prevention .

OBJECTIVE	To compare staples with subcuticular sutures for skin closure in emergency Cesarean sections ( CS ) .
METHODS	One hundred and thirty women ( undergoing emergency CS without previous abdominal delivery ) were randomly assigned to either staples or subcuticular skin closure ( monocryl @-@ ) .
METHODS	Primary outcome of the study was cosmetic outcome -LSB- as assessed by patient and independent observer : Patient Scar Assessment Scale ( PSAS ) and Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( OSAS ) , respectively -RSB- , @weeks post-operative .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were wound complications , operating time , post-operative pain ( visual analogue scale day @ post-operative and patient assessment of pain in scar @weeks post-operative ) , and duration of hospital stay .
RESULTS	@ women were available for evaluation of scar @weeks post-operative .
RESULTS	Cosmetic result of staples was significantly better than subcuticular sutures ( PSAS and OSAS : p value @ and @ , respectively ) , with significantly lesser duration of surgery ( @ vs. @min : p value @ ) and comparable post-operative pain ( pain on day @ and @weeks post-operatively : p value @ and @ , respectively ) and wound complications ( p value @ ) .
RESULTS	However , duration of stay in hospital was increased ( @ vs. @days : p value @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Staples are the method of choice for skin closure in emergency CS as they are significantly better than subcuticular sutures with respect to cosmesis and duration of surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Post-operative pain and wound complications are comparable in two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	However , staples are associated with significantly increased duration of hospital stay .

BACKGROUND	Chronic thoracic pain after cardiac surgery is prevalent ( @ to @ % ) and may affect patients ' physical and mental health status .
BACKGROUND	Despite its favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties , high doses of remifentanil administered during surgery are reported to cause acute postoperative pain and increased requirements for analgesics .
BACKGROUND	Recently , an association between remifentanil use and the incidence of chronic thoracic pain in the long term was also reported .
BACKGROUND	Our objective is to investigate the influence of the intraoperative remifentanil on chronic postoperative pain in a prospective randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	In this prospective , randomized , single-blind clinical trial , all patients ( N = @ ) between @ and @ years undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy receive a continuous infusion of propofol together with intermittent intravenous fentanyl at predetermined times perioperatively .
METHODS	Patients are randomized to receive either an additional continuous infusion of remifentanil ( @ g ( -@ ) kgIBW ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) or additional fentanyl ( @ to @ g ) as needed during surgery.The primary end point is the prevalence of chronic thoracic pain @ months after surgery .
METHODS	Secondary end points include acute postoperative pain ; postoperative analgesic use ; chronic thoracic pain @ and @ months after surgery ; quality of life ( SF-@ ) at @ , @ and @ months after surgery ; work productivity ; and use of health care .
METHODS	In addition , thermal detection and pain thresholds are measured preoperatively , @ days after surgery and @ months after surgery using quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) .
METHODS	Finally , the influence of several genetic variances on the different outcomes will be measured .
CONCLUSIONS	Chronic thoracic pain is prevalent after cardiac surgery , and research is needed to minimize the risk of chronic persistent postoperative pain , which is an invalidating , long-term complication of surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	The objective of this trial is to determine the influence of perioperative remifentanil on long-term pain outcomes for cardiac patients in a prospective randomized trial .
CONCLUSIONS	The results may be used to optimize perioperative analgesia techniques and , thereby , improve quality of life after cardiac surgery .

OBJECTIVE	To develop a reliable and safe laryngeal nerve conduction technique and to obtain consistent parameters as normal reference values .
METHODS	A prospective single-arm study .
METHODS	A nerve conduction test was performed on the contralateral normal side in @ patients with unilateral vocal fold palsy .
METHODS	The recording was performed in the intact thyroarytenoid muscle using a monopolar needle .
METHODS	The electrical stimulation using a @-mm monopolar needle was applied @ cm below the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage , just lateral to the trachea and medial to the carotid artery , and its intensity was gradually increased until the amplitude of the electrical response reached the maximum level .
METHODS	The latency of the evoked muscle response was acquired at the first evoked waveform deflection from the baseline .
RESULTS	The average latency of the recurrent laryngeal nerves was @ ms. The latencies showed normal distribution according to the quantile-quantile plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in latencies between the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves .
RESULTS	Anthropometric factors including height and weight did not show any correlation with the latencies .
CONCLUSIONS	We developed a reliable and safe laryngeal nerve conduction technique and obtained normal reference values for the recurrent laryngeal nerve conduction study .
CONCLUSIONS	This laryngeal nerve conduction study can be an additional tool for detecting recurrent laryngeal nerve injury if it is performed in combination with the conventional laryngeal electromyography .

###25012422
OBJECTIVE	Because increased dopamine neurotransmission occurs with most antidepressants , and because antipsychotics cause behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine , short-term low-dose antipsychotic treatment was tested on depressed patients with an expectation of clinical improvement in the supersensitive phase following drug withdrawal .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of @ patients who met criteria for DSM-IV ( ) Major Depressive Disorder , were in a Major Depressive Episode , and had a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD ) rating of @ .
METHODS	Half the participants received @ mg oral haloperidol each day for @ days , after which they received placebo daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	The other half received placebo throughout the trial .
RESULTS	One week after stopping the medication , the HAMD ratings of the drug-treated patients fell by @ points , as compared to a reduction of @ points in the placebo-treated patients , when comparing visits @ and @ .
RESULTS	There was no such difference when comparing visits @ and @ .
RESULTS	The differences were not significant , but indicated a trend .
RESULTS	One week after the medication was stopped , the Clinical Global Index fell @ units for the medication-treated patients , compared to @ units for the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The regimen was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Seven days of an ultra-low dose of @ mg haloperidol , followed by withdrawal of haloperidol , resulted in clinical depression improvement greater than placebo and significantly decreased psychomotor retardation , consistent with haloperidol-induced behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine .
CONCLUSIONS	The sample was small .
CONCLUSIONS	More patients are needed in a future study .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether stereopsis of infants treated for monocular cataracts varies with the type of optical correction used .
METHODS	Randomized prospective clinical trial .
METHODS	The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study randomized @ patients with unilateral cataracts at age @-@ months to either primary intraocular lens ( IOL ) or contact lens correction .
METHODS	At @ years of age a masked examiner assessed stereopsis on these patients using @ different tests : ( @ ) Frisby ; ( @ ) Randot Preschool ; and ( @ ) Titmus Fly .
RESULTS	Twenty-eight patients ( @ % ) had a positive response to at least @ of the stereopsis tests .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in stereopsis between the @ treatment groups : Frisby ( contact lens , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; IOL , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) , Randot ( contact lens , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; IOL , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) , or Titmus ( contact lens , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; IOL , @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median age at surgery for patients with stereopsis was younger than for those without stereopsis ( @ vs @ months ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median visual acuity for patients with stereopsis was better than for those without stereopsis ( @/@ vs @/@ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The type of optical correction did not influence stereopsis outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	However , @ other factors did : age at surgery and visual acuity in the treated eye at age @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	Early surgery for unilateral congenital cataract and the presence of visual acuity better than or equal to @/@ appear to be more important than the type of initial optical correction used for the development of stereopsis .

BACKGROUND	Although the rate of bleeding among patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) taking novel oral anticoagulants in randomized controlled trials is described , the rate of bleeding with `` real-world '' use is uncertain .
METHODS	We conducted a retrospective electronic medical record interrogation and subsequent chart review among patients within Intermountain Healthcare between October @ and November @ .
METHODS	Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of AF and were receiving either dabigatran or rivaroxaban .
METHODS	Rates of major bleeding were calculated .
RESULTS	Among @ patients , @ ( @ % ) experienced major bleeding ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ ) , @ ( @ % ) experienced intracranial hemorrhage ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and @ ( @ % ) experienced fatal bleeding .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients experiencing a major bleed , @ ( @ % ) would have been excluded from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy ( RE-LY ) and Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation ( ROCKET AF ) clinical trials .
CONCLUSIONS	We observed a rate of major bleeding similar to that reported in randomized clinical trials among patients with AF prescribed dabigatran or rivaroxaban .

BACKGROUND	Psychosocial problems are highly prevalent among Dutch adolescents .
BACKGROUND	We have conducted a trial to test whether offering chat-based consultations could be of added value within the context of Dutch Youth Health Care .
BACKGROUND	This trial was ended prematurely because of recruitment issues .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to learn from this failed trial and to provide more insight into non-participation .
BACKGROUND	Sources of data were non-participation forms , oral clarification , patient records , telephone interviews with adolescents that declined to participate , and a questionnaire-based process evaluation among nurses .
RESULTS	Non-participation appears to be a multi-factorial problem .
RESULTS	Of those @ adolescents eligible to participate , the majority ( n = @ , @ % ) declined to do so .
RESULTS	Two-third of those ( n = @ ) also refused usual care , which might be indicative of not wanting help and/or experiencing problems and the validity of the assessment instrument .
RESULTS	The other one-third ( n = @ ) did enrol in usual care and indicated other reasons for non-participation , such as a preference for face-to-face consultations , the extensive information that was provided , and not liking the idea of being randomized .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that even if a trial fails , we can learn about the challenges of recruiting adolescents in intervention trials .

OBJECTIVE	Whether there are age-related changes in slow wave activity ( SWA ) rise time , a marker of homeostatic sleep drive , is unknown .
OBJECTIVE	Additionally , although sleep medication use is highest among older adults , the quantitative electroencephalographic ( EEG ) profile of the most commonly prescribed sleep medication , zolpidem , in older adults is also unknown .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore quantified age-related and regional brain differences in sleep EEG with and without zolpidem .
METHODS	Thirteen healthy young adults aged @ years and @ healthy older adults aged @ years participated in a randomized , double-blind , within-subject study that compared placebo to @mg zolpidem .
RESULTS	Older adults showed a smaller rise in SWA and zolpidem increased age-related differences in SWA rise time such that age differences were observed earlier after latency to persistent sleep .
RESULTS	Age-related differences in EEG power differed by brain region .
RESULTS	Older , but not young , adults showed zolpidem-dependent reductions in theta and alpha frequencies .
RESULTS	Zolpidem decreased stage @ in older adults and did not alter other age-related sleep architecture parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	SWA findings provide additional support for reduced homeostatic sleep drive or reduced ability to respond to sleep drive with age .
CONCLUSIONS	Consequences of reduced power in theta and alpha frequencies in older adults remain to be elucidated .

BACKGROUND	The Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKD-EPI ) are @ equations commonly used to estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .
BACKGROUND	The predictive performance offered by these equations , particularly in relation to clinical outcomes in elderly hypertensive patients , is not clear .
METHODS	The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study cohort was used to investigate the predictive performance of these @ equations for long-term outcomes ( median @ years ) in elderly treated hypertensive patients .
METHODS	Both equations were used to calculate eGFR in @,@ patients aged @ years and classified as having chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) or no CKD ( eGFR @ml/min/@ @ m@ ) .
RESULTS	More patients were classified as having no CKD using the CKD-EPI equation compared with the MDRD equation ( @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both equations performed similarly in risk prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with decreased eGFR , except for patients with baseline eGFR of @-@ml / min/@ @ m@ , where the CKD-EPI equation predicted higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with those with no CKD .
RESULTS	However , the magnitude of difference in risk prediction was too small to be clinically meaningful .
RESULTS	Both equations showed similar predictive performance .
RESULTS	However , we observed longer survival and no higher risk in those who were reclassified as having no CKD using the CKD-EPI equation , but these patients were classified earlier as having CKD using the MDRD equation .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no clinically relevant difference in predictive performance for long-term survival by eGFR calculated using either of these equations in this elderly hypertensive population .

BACKGROUND	Ischemic mitral regurgitation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity .
BACKGROUND	For surgical patients with moderate regurgitation , the benefits of adding mitral-valve repair to coronary-artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) are uncertain .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @ patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation to CABG alone or CABG plus mitral-valve repair ( combined procedure ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was the left ventricular end-systolic volume index ( LVESVI ) , a measure of left ventricular remodeling , at @ year .
METHODS	This end point was assessed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in which deaths were categorized as the lowest LVESVI rank .
RESULTS	At @ year , the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was @ ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and @ ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group ( mean change from baseline , -@ and -@ ml per square meter , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The rate of death was @ % in the combined-procedure group and @ % in the CABG-alone group ( hazard ratio with mitral-valve repair , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at @ year ( incorporating deaths ) showed no significant between-group difference ( z score , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The addition of mitral-valve repair was associated with a longer bypass time ( P < @ ) , a longer hospital stay after surgery ( P = @ ) , and more neurologic events ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was less common in the combined-procedure group than in the CABG-alone group ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant between-group differences in major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events , deaths , readmissions , functional status , or quality of life at @ year .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation , the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG did not result in a higher degree of left ventricular reverse remodeling .
CONCLUSIONS	Mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation but an increased number of untoward events .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , at @ year , this trial did not show a clinically meaningful advantage of adding mitral-valve repair to CABG .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer-term follow-up may determine whether the lower prevalence of mitral regurgitation translates into a net clinical benefit .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of stellate ganglion block ( SGB ) on the peri-operative vasomotor cytokine content and intrapulmonary shunt in patients with esophagus cancer who underwent thoracotomy .
METHODS	Forty patients undergoing elective resection of esophageal cancer patients who had I ~ II American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) were randomly divided into total intravenous anesthesia group ( group N , n = @ ) and total intravenous anesthesia combined with SGB group ( group S , n = @ , @ mL/kg @ % lidocaine was used for SGB @ min before induction ) .
METHODS	Heart rate ( HR ) , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , central venous pressure ( CVP ) , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( MPAP ) and continuous cardiac output ( CCO ) were continuously monitored .
METHODS	The blood from internal jugular vein was drawn respectively before induction ( T@ ) , and @ min ( T@ ) , @ min ( T@ ) and @ min ( T@ ) after one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) , and @ min ( T@ ) after two-lung ventilation .
METHODS	The contents of plasma endothelin ( ET ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
METHODS	Meanwhile , arterial and mixed venous blood samples were collected for determination of blood gas and calculation of intrapulmonary shunt fraction ( Qs/Qt ) .
RESULTS	During OLV , ET contents were increased significantly in two groups ( P < @ ) , and no significant difference was presented ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	NO content in group S was obviously higher than in group N at T@ ( P < @ ) , whereas CGRP content in group N was markedly lower than in group S at each time point ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Qs/Qt was significantly increased in both groups after OLV , but there was no statistical significant regarding the Qs/Qt at each time point between two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Total intravenous anesthesia combined with SGB is conducive to regulation of perioperative vasomotor cytokines in thoracotomy , and has little effect on intrapulmonary shunt at the time of OLV .

BACKGROUND	Yes-associated protein ( YAP@ ) is frequently reported to function as an oncogene in many types of cancer , but in breast cancer results remain controversial .
BACKGROUND	We set out to clarify the role of YAP@ in breast cancer by examining gene and protein expression in subgroups of patient material and by downregulating YAP@ in vitro and studying its role in response to the widely used anti-estrogen tamoxifen .
METHODS	YAP@ protein intensity was scored as absent , weak , intermediate or strong in two primary breast cancer cohorts ( n = @ and n = @ ) and mRNA expression of YAP@ was evaluated in a gene expression dataset ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Recurrence-free survival was analysed using the log-rank test and Cox multivariate analysis was used to test for independence .
METHODS	WST-@ assay was employed to measure cell viability and a luciferase ERE ( estrogen responsive element ) construct was used to study the effect of tamoxifen , following downregulation of YAP@ using siRNAs .
RESULTS	In the ER + ( Estrogen Receptor positive ) subgroup of the randomised cohort , YAP@ expression was inversely correlated to histological grade and proliferation ( p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) whereas in the ER - ( Estrogen Receptor negative ) subgroup YAP@ expression correlated positively to proliferation ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Notably , low YAP@ mRNA was independently associated with decreased recurrence-free survival in the gene expression dataset , specifically for the luminal A subgroup ( p < @ ) which includes low proliferating tumours of lower grade , usually associated with a good prognosis .
RESULTS	This subgroup specificity led us to hypothesize that YAP@ may be important for response to endocrine therapies , such as tamoxifen , extensively used for luminal A breast cancers .
RESULTS	In a tamoxifen randomised patient material , absent YAP@ protein expression was associated with impaired tamoxifen response which was significant upon interaction analysis ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	YAP@ downregulation resulted in increased progesterone receptor ( PgR ) expression and a delayed and weaker tamoxifen in support of the clinical data .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreased YAP@ expression is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in the less aggressive luminal A breast cancer subgroup , likely due to the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity conferred by YAP@ downregulation .

BACKGROUND	Patients surviving stroke but who have significant impairment of function in the affected arm are at more risk of developing pain , stiffness and contractures .
BACKGROUND	The abnormal muscle activity , associated with post-stroke spasticity , is thought to be causally associated with the development of these complications .
BACKGROUND	Treatment of spasticity is currently delayed until a patient develops signs of these complications .
METHODS	This protocol is for a phase II study that aims to identify whether using OnabotulinumtoxinA ( BoNT-A ) in combination with physiotherapy early post stroke when initial abnormal muscle activity is neurophysiologically identified can prevent loss of range at joints and improve functional outcomes.The trial uses a screening phase to identify which people are appropriate to be included in a double blind randomised placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	All patients admitted to Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust Hospitals with a diagnosis of stroke will be screened to identify functional activity in the arm .
METHODS	Those who have no function will be appropriate for further screening .
METHODS	Patients who are screened and have abnormal muscle activity identified on EMG will be given electrical stimulation to forearm extensors for @ months and randomised to have either injections of BoNT-A or normal saline .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure is the action research arm test - a measure of arm function .
METHODS	Further measures include spasticity , stiffness , muscle strength and fatigue as well as measures of quality of life , participation and caregiver strain .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate and compare several quantification methods of myocardial perfusion measurements , paying special attention to the relation between the techniques and the required measurement duration .
METHODS	Seven patients underwent contrast-enhanced rest and stress cardiac perfusion measurements at @T .
METHODS	Three slices were acquired in each patient and were divided into @ segments , leading to @ rest and stress data curves , which were analyzed using various tracer kinetic models as well as a model-free deconvolution .
METHODS	Plasma flow , plasma volume , and myocardial perfusion reserve were analyzed for the complete acquisition as well as for the first pass data only .
RESULTS	Deconvolution analysis yielded stable results for both rest and stress analysis , while Fermi and one compartment models agree well for first pass data ( rest measurements only ) and prolonged data acquisition ( stress measurements only ) .
RESULTS	More complex models do not yield satisfactory results for the short measurement times investigated in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	When performing MRI-based quantification of myocardial perfusion , care must be taken that the method used is appropriate for the time frame under investigation .
CONCLUSIONS	When a numerical deconvolution is used instead of tracer kinetic models , more stable results are obtained .

BACKGROUND	Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) may independently influence offspring fat mass and metabolic disease susceptibility .
BACKGROUND	In this pilot study , body composition and fat distribution in offspring from obese women with and without GDM and lean women were assessed within the @st year of life , and maternal and newborn plasma factors were related to offspring adipose tissue distribution .
METHODS	Serum and plasma samples from pregnant obese women with ( n = @ ) or without ( n = @ ) GDM and normoglycemic lean women ( n = @ ) at @rd trimester and offspring cord plasma were used for analyzing lipid profiles , insulin and adipokine levels .
METHODS	At week-@ and @ , month-@ and year-@ , offspring anthropometrics and skinfold thickness ( SFT ) were measured and abdominal subcutaneous ( SCA ) and preperitoneal adipose tissue ( PPA ) were determined by ultrasonography .
RESULTS	Cord insulin was significantly increased in the GDM group , whereas levels of cord leptin , total and high molecular weight ( HMW ) adiponectin were similar between the groups .
RESULTS	Neonates of the GDM group showed significantly higher SFT and fat mass until week-@ and significantly increased SCA at week-@ compared to the lean group that persisted as strong trend at week-@ .
RESULTS	Interestingly , PPA in neonates of the GDM group was significantly elevated at week-@ compared to both the lean and obese group .
RESULTS	At month-@ and year-@ , significant differences in adipose tissue growth between the groups were not observed .
RESULTS	Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that cord insulin levels are independently related to neonatal PPA that showed significant relation to PPA development at year-@ .
RESULTS	Maternal fasted C-peptide and HMW adiponectin levels at @rd trimester emerged to be determinants for PPA at week-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal pregravid obesity combined with GDM leads to newborn hyperinsulinemia and increased offspring fat mass until week-@ , whereas pregravid obesity without GDM does not .
CONCLUSIONS	This strongly suggests the pivotal role of GDM in the adverse offspring outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal C-peptide and HMW adiponectin levels in pregnancy emerge to be predictive for elevated PPA in newborns and might be indicative for the obesity risk at later life .
CONCLUSIONS	Altogether , the findings from our pilot study warrant evaluation in long-term studies .

BACKGROUND	Raltegravir is an HIV-@ integrase inhibitor approved for use in adults , children and infants @ weeks of age .
BACKGROUND	As alternatives to the original film-coated tablet , a chewable ethylcellulose ( EC ) tablet and oral granules for suspension ( GFS ) have been developed for use in children .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate these formulations in adults prior to use in paediatric studies .
METHODS	This open-label , @-period , randomized , crossover study investigated the safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir paediatric formulations and the effect of a high-fat meal on EC tablet pharmacokinetics in healthy adults .
METHODS	In a balanced , crossover design ( with a @-day washout between treatments ) , @ subjects received one @ mg film-coated tablet ( fasted ) , four @ mg EC tablets ( fasted ) , one @ mg GFS dose ( fasted ) and four @ mg EC tablets ( after a high-fat meal ) .
RESULTS	AUC@ - and Cmax were @-fold and @-fold higher for GFS and @-fold and @-fold higher for EC versus film-coated tablets .
RESULTS	The geometric mean C@h values for the GFS formulation ( @ nM ) and the EC tablet ( @ nM ) were similar to that of the film-coated tablet ( @ nM ) .
RESULTS	Administration with a high-fat meal increased C@h , decreased Cmax and delayed Tmax for the EC tablet , but did not affect AUC@ - .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events ( AEs ) and no discontinuations due to drug-related clinical or laboratory AEs .
CONCLUSIONS	Both paediatric formulations demonstrate moderately higher AUC@ - and Cmax , and similar C@h compared with the film-coated tablet .
CONCLUSIONS	These data support the use of raltegravir GFS and EC formulations in paediatric studies .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether exercise training might exert anti-inflammatory effect by reducing HMGB@ levels in women with breast cancer ( BC ) .
METHODS	We analyzed monocentric data from the DIANA ( DIET AND ANDROGENS ) -@ PROJECT .
METHODS	Study population consisted of @ patients randomized into two groups : @ patients ( @ + / - @ yrs , training group ) were assigned to a structured exercise training intervention ( @ times/week for the first @ months , and once / week for the following @ months ) ; whereas @ patients ( @ + / - @ yrs , control group ) followed only the general indications to adhere to the life-style intervention suggestions of the DIANA protocol .
METHODS	At study entry and after @ months , all patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing , biochemical as - sessment -LSB- HMGB@ , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) -RSB- ; and lipid and glycemic profile .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between groups in baseline clinical and inflammatory profile .
RESULTS	Among the training group , only @/@ patients had high adherence to the exercise intervention .
RESULTS	After stratifying the study population according to the level of adhesion to the exer - cise intervention , @-year HMGB@ levels were lower among patients more adherent to exercise ( p for trend = @ ) .
RESULTS	Further adjusting for age , body mass index and baseline values , @-year HMGB@ levels remained significantly and inversely associated to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention ( B = -@ , SE = @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Moderate intensity exercise training in BC survivors is associated with reduced HMGB@ levels that are proportional to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention , independently from other classical inflammatory molecules , suggesting an exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect mediated by HMGB@ .

BACKGROUND	Multiple phase-@ trials in men with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer ( BRPC ) have assessed the impact of nonhormonal agents on PSA kinetics .
BACKGROUND	We have previously demonstrated that changes in PSA kinetics correlate with metastasis-free survival ; however , it is unknown whether these changes also correlate with overall survival ( OS ) .
METHODS	We performed a combined retrospective analysis of @ men with BRPC treated on phase-@ trials using one of four investigational drugs : lenalidomide ( n = @ ) , marimastat ( n = @ ) , ATN-@ ( n = @ ) and imatinib ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	We examined factors influencing OS , including within-subject changes in PSA kinetics ( PSA slope , PSA doubling time and PSA velocity ) , before and @ months after treatment initiation .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months , @ of @ men had died .
RESULTS	In univariate Cox regression analysis , two factors were associated with OS : baseline PSA velocity and change in PSA velocity on therapy .
RESULTS	In a landmark multivariable model , stratified by study ( which controlled for age , Gleason score , type of local therapy and use of androgen-deprivation therapy prior to metastases ) , baseline PSA velocity and increase in PSA velocity on therapy remained independent predictors of OS .
RESULTS	Median OS for men with an increase in PSA velocity on treatment was @ months and was not reached for men with a decrease in PSA velocity ( hazard ratio = @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This hypothesis-generating study suggests that within-subject changes in PSA velocity after initiation of nonhormonal therapy may correlate with OS in men with BRPC .
CONCLUSIONS	If validated in prospective trials , change in PSA velocity may represent a reasonable intermediate end point for screening new agents in these patients .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of and compliance with a new device for autoinflation in the treatment of persistent otitis media with effusion ( OME ) in young children .
METHODS	Forty-five children with persistent OME with a bilateral type B or C@ tympanogram for at least three months and history of subjective hearing loss , waiting for grommet surgery , were randomised to a treatment and a control group .
METHODS	Twenty-three children aged between three and eight years started as the treatment group with the new device for autoinflation .
METHODS	Another @ children , aged between two and eight years were included as controls .
METHODS	After a period of four weeks , a cross-over was performed .
METHODS	Both groups underwent otomicroscopy , tympanometry and audiometry at inclusion and after one and two months for the evaluation of treatment efficiency .
METHODS	The primary outcome measurements were improvement in middle-ear pressure and hearing thresholds at eight weeks .
METHODS	Both groups were then followed up for another @ months .
RESULTS	In the treatment group , the mean middle-ear pressure for both ears and the mean hearing thresholds for the best ear improved by @ daPa ( p < @ ) and @ dB ( p < @ ) , respectively after four weeks , while in the control group , non-significant alterations were observed .
RESULTS	After the cross-over of the control group to treatment , equivalent improvements in the mean middle-ear pressure and the mean hearing thresholds of @ daPa ( p < @ ) and @ dB ( p < @ ) , respectively were achieved also in this group .
RESULTS	After treatment in both groups at eight weeks , four of @ children were submitted to grommet surgery .
RESULTS	During the long-term follow-up another five children were submitted to surgery due to recurrence of disease .
RESULTS	All the children managed to perform the manoeuvre and no side-effects were detected .
CONCLUSIONS	The device demonstrated efficiency in improving both middle-ear pressure and hearing thresholds in most children after four weeks of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	It might therefore be possible to consider this method of autoinflation in children with persistent OME during the watchful waiting period .

BACKGROUND	The negative consequences of unhealthy weight gain and the high likelihood of pediatric obesity tracking into adulthood highlight the importance of targeting youth who are ` at risk ' of obesity .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this paper is to report the rationale and study protocol for the ` Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time ' ( ATLAS ) obesity prevention intervention for adolescent boys living in low-income communities .
METHODS	The ATLAS intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in @ secondary schools in the state of New South Wales ( NSW ) , Australia ( @ to @ ) .
METHODS	ATLAS is an @-month multi-component , school-based program informed by self-determination theory and social cognitive theory .
METHODS	The intervention consists of teacher professional development , enhanced school-sport sessions , researcher-led seminars , lunch-time physical activity mentoring sessions , pedometers for self-monitoring , provision of equipment to schools , parental newsletters , and a smartphone application and website .
METHODS	Assessments were conducted at baseline and will be completed again at @ - and @-months from baseline .
METHODS	Primary outcomes are body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes include BMI z-scores , body fat ( bioelectrical impedance analysis ) , physical activity ( accelerometers ) , muscular fitness ( grip strength and push-ups ) , screen-time , sugar-sweetened beverage consumption , resistance training skill competency , daytime sleepiness , subjective well-being , physical self-perception , pathological video gaming , and aggression .
METHODS	Hypothesized mediators of behavior change will also be explored .
CONCLUSIONS	ATLAS is an innovative school-based intervention designed to improve the health behaviors and related outcomes of adolescent males in low-income communities .

OBJECTIVE	Our recent work indicates that endogenous opioid activity influences analgesic responses to opioid medications .
OBJECTIVE	This secondary analysis evaluated whether endogenous opioid activity is associated with degree of opioid analgesic adverse effects , and whether chronic pain status and sex affect these adverse effects .
METHODS	Using a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover design , @ subjects with chronic low back pain and @ healthy controls participated in @ separate sessions , undergoing @ laboratory-evoked pain tasks ( ischemic and thermal ) after receiving placebo , naloxone , or morphine .
METHODS	Endogenous opioid system function was indexed by the difference in pain responses between the placebo and naloxone conditions .
METHODS	These measures were examined for associations with morphine-related adverse effects .
RESULTS	Chronic pain subjects reported significantly greater itching and unpleasant bodily sensations with morphine than controls ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Across groups , only @ of @ possible associations between adverse effects and blockade effects were significant .
RESULTS	For the ischemic task , higher endogenous opioid function was associated with greater itching ( visual analog scale -LSB- VAS -RSB- ; P < @ ) , numbness ( tolerance ; P < @ ) , dry mouth ( tolerance ; P < @ ) , and unpleasant bodily sensations ( VAS ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	For the thermal task , higher endogenous opioid function was associated with greater numbness ( VAS ; P < @ ) and feeling carefree ( VAS ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant main or interaction effects of chronic pain status or sex on these findings .
CONCLUSIONS	No consistent relationships were observed between endogenous opioid function and morphine-related adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS	This is in stark contrast to our previous observation of strong relationships between elevated endogenous opioid function and smaller morphine analgesic effects .

OBJECTIVE	A new core biopsy needle for endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) - guided sampling has recently been developed .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to compare this needle with a standard needle in patients with solid pancreatic masses .
METHODS	Consecutive patients with solid pancreatic masses referred to @ centers for EUS-guided sampling were included .
METHODS	Each patient had two passes with a standard @G needle and a single pass with a @G core needle performed in a randomized order .
METHODS	Samples from both needles were separately processed for liquid-based cytology and cell-block preparation and were assessed independently by two blinded expert pathologists .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the accuracy of the detection of malignancy .
METHODS	The reference standard was based on further cytohistological analysis obtained under ultrasound or computed tomography scanning , endoscopic or surgical guidance , and/or by clinical follow-up with repeated imaging examinations for at least @ months .
METHODS	The secondary endpoints were the rate of technical failure and the quality of the cytohistological samples obtained .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients included ( @ men ; mean age @ ) , @ % had final malignant diagnoses ( adenocarcinoma n = @ , @ % ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the needles in diagnostic accuracy ( standard needle @ % vs. core needle @ % ; P = @ ) or technical failure .
RESULTS	Both pathologists found the overall sample quality significantly better for the standard needle ( expert @ , P = @ ; expert @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The diagnostic accuracy of EUS sampling for solid pancreatic masses using standard and core needles seems comparable but with a better overall histological sample quality for the former .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrial.gov identifier : NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different intravenous ( IV ) doses of palonosetron compared with placebo for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) in children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia ( DRGA ) in the first @ hours after discharge .
METHODS	A total of @ children who were classified with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I and II , between three and @ years old ( mean = @ years old ) , and undergoing DRGA were enrolled in this study .
METHODS	The children were randomized to receive one of the three doses of palonosetron ( @ mg , @ mg , or @ mg ) or placebo immediately before induction of anesthesia .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , the incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the palonosetron groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , there were no statistically significant differences among the palonosetron groups regarding the number of children with PONV during all time periods after anesthesia ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A single @ mg intravenous dose of palonosetron is recommended for further evaluation , as it appears to be an effective dose for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia .

OBJECTIVE	To assess bacillus Calmette-Gurin maintenance treatment schedule for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer at @ years , using one-third of the full dose and fewer instillations every @ months or @ months .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , multicenter study .
METHODS	All patients had an intermediate - or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer .
METHODS	They received three weekly instillations of one-third dose bacillus Calmette-Gurin every @ months ( group I ) and two weekly instillations every @ months ( group II ) during @ years .
METHODS	In the two schedules we assessed efficacy , tolerance , leukocyturia and prostate-specific antigen .
RESULTS	No significant difference was observed between the two groups for recurrence at @ , @ or @ months .
RESULTS	At @ years , tumor recurrence was observed in @ % and muscle invasion in @ % of cases .
RESULTS	Bacillus Calmette-Gurin tolerance was comparable - the adverse events score was @ in group I and @ in group II ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No statistical correlation was observed between the adverse events score over @ years , either for leukocyturia ( P = @ ) or prostate-specific antigen level ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Leukocyturia level was not significantly associated with tumor recurrence or progression .
CONCLUSIONS	One-third dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Gurin is effective with no impact on tumor recurrence or muscle invasion .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , there seems to be no difference in tumor response or side-effects between patients receiving two or three maintenance instillations every @ months or @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	In clinical practice , the use of leukocyturia or total prostate-specific antigen levels do not appear to be useful in predicting bacillus Calmette-Gurin toxicity .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the usefulness of velocity ratio ( VR ) in patients with low gradient severe aortic stenosis ( LGSAS ) and preserved EF .
BACKGROUND	LGSAS despite preserved EF represents a clinically challenging entity .
BACKGROUND	Reliance on mean pressure gradient ( MPG ) may underestimate stenosis severity as has been reported in the context of paradoxical low flow , LGSAS .
BACKGROUND	On the other hand , grading of stenosis severity by aortic valve area ( AVA ) may overrate stenosis severity due to erroneous underestimation of LV outflow tract ( LVOT ) diameter , small body size or inconsistencies in cut-off values for severe stenosis .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesised that VR may have conceptual advantages over MPG and AVA , predict clinical outcomes and thereby be useful in the management of patients with LGSAS .
METHODS	Patients from the prospective Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis ( SEAS ) study with an AVA < @ cm ( @ ) , MPG@mmHg and EF@ % and asymptomatic at baseline were stratified according to VR with a cut-off value of @ .
METHODS	Outcomes were evaluated according to aortic valve-related events and cardiovascular death .
RESULTS	Of @ patients with LGSAS , @ ( @ % ) had VR < @ suggesting severe and @ ( @ % ) had VR@ @ suggesting non-severe stenosis .
RESULTS	Aortic valve-related events ( mean follow-up @months ) were more frequent in patients with VR < @ ( @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) as was cardiovascular death within the first @months ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In multivariable Cox regression analysis , MPG was the strongest independent predictor of aortic valve events ( p < @ ) followed by VR ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Adjusting AVA by VR increased predictive accuracy for aortic valve events ( area under the receiver operating curve @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) vs @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) for AVA , p = @ ) with net reclassification improvement calculated at @ ( @ % CI @ to @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	VR did not improve the prediction of clinical events by MPG .
CONCLUSIONS	In the difficult setting of LGSAS , VR shows a strong association with valve-related events and-although not outperforming MPG-may be particularly useful in guiding clinical management .

OBJECTIVE	The objective was to assess the long-term safety profile of dual-release hydrocortisone ( DR-HC ) in patients with adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) .
METHODS	Randomised , open-label , crossover trial of DR-HC or thrice-daily hydrocortisone for @ months each ( stage @ ) followed by two consecutive , prospective , open-label studies of DR-HC for @ months ( stage @ ) and @ months ( stage @ ) at five university clinics in Sweden .
METHODS	Sixty-four adults with primary AI started stage @ , and an additional @ entered stage @ .
METHODS	Patients received DR-HC @-@mg once daily and hydrocortisone @-@mg divided into three daily doses ( stage @ only ) .
METHODS	Main outcome measures were adverse events ( AEs ) and intercurrent illness ( self-reported hydrocortisone use during illness ) .
RESULTS	In stage @ , patients had a median @ ( range , @-@ ) intercurrent illness events with DR-HC and @ ( @-@ ) with thrice-daily hydrocortisone .
RESULTS	AEs during stage @ were not related to the cortisol exposure-time profile .
RESULTS	The percentage of patients with one or more AEs during stage @ ( @ % with DR-HC ; @ % with thrice-daily hydrocortisone ) decreased during stage @ , when all patients received DR-HC ( @ % in the first @ months ; @ % in the second @ months ) .
RESULTS	In stages @-@ combined , @ patients experienced @ serious AEs , equating to @ serious AEs/@ patient-years of DR-HC exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	This long-term prospective trial is the first to document the safety of DR-HC in patients with primary AI and demonstrates that such treatment is well tolerated during @ consecutive months of therapy .

BACKGROUND	Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia .
METHODS	Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat ( n = @ ) or low-carbohydrate ( n = @ ) diet .
METHODS	As part of the @-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness ( LEAF ) intervention trial , we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm .
RESULTS	Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Across study arms , there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure ( SBP , @mm Hg , p = @ ) over time , but diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) did not change significantly over the course of the study .
RESULTS	Blood lipids ( total cholesterol -LSB- TC -RSB- , low-density lipoproteins -LSB- LDL -RSB- , and high-density lipoproteins -LSB- HDL -RSB- ) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time ( p < @ ) ; each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline ( p < @ ) , but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women .
CONCLUSIONS	However , a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population .
CONCLUSIONS	These changes can be maintained over the course of a @-year intervention , yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable .

BACKGROUND	Intrafraction tumour motion in helical tomotherapy was investigated by comparing pre - and mid-fraction CT scans in patients with early non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) to assess the efficacy of a @-mm margin around gross tumour volumes ( GTVs ) in stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) .
METHODS	Thirty patients with early-stage NSCLC received SBRT in four or five fractions for a total of @ treatments .
METHODS	A slow positron emission tomography/CT scan was fused with the simulation CT to determine the GTV .
METHODS	A planning target volume was created by placing an isotropic margin of @mm around the GTV .
METHODS	Data were retrospectively analyzed to assess translational tumour positional changes along the x , y and z axes and vector changes in millimeters from the pretreatment megavoltage ( MV ) - CT to the mid-fraction MV-CT .
RESULTS	Average movements for all @ treatment days along the x , y and z axes were @ , -@ and @ mm , respectively .
RESULTS	Average movements for each patient along the x , y and z axes were @ , -@ and @ mm , respectively .
RESULTS	Average vector displacement was @ mm for all treatment days and @ mm for each patient .
RESULTS	Of @ treatments , @ ( @ % ) fell within @ mm in all axes .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of a @-mm margin to the GTV for patients receiving SBRT for NSCLC using tomotherapy is adequate to account for tumour movement .
CONCLUSIONS	Mid-fraction CT scans proved to be valuable in assessing intrafraction tumour motion .

OBJECTIVE	Standard varenicline tartrate dosing was formulated to avoid adverse effects ( primarily nausea ) , but some patients may be underdosed .
OBJECTIVE	To our knowledge , no evidence-based guidance exists for physicians considering increasing varenicline dose if there is no response to the standard dosage .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether increasing varenicline dose in patients showing no response to the standard dosage improves treatment efficacy .
METHODS	In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial , @ smokers attending a stop smoking clinic commenced varenicline use @ weeks before their target quit date ( TQD ) .
METHODS	Two hundred participants reporting no strong nausea , no clear reduction in smoking enjoyment , and less than @ % reduction in their baseline smoking on day @ received additional tablets of varenicline or placebo .
METHODS	All participants began standard varenicline tartrate dosing , gradually increasing to @ mg/d .
METHODS	Dose increases of twice-daily varenicline ( @ mg ) or placebo took place on days @ , @ , and @ ( up to a maximum of @ mg/d ) .
METHODS	Participants rated their smoking enjoyment during the prequit period and withdrawal symptoms weekly for the first @ weeks after the TQD .
METHODS	Continuous validated abstinence rates were assessed at @ , @ , and @ weeks after the TQD .
RESULTS	The dose increase reduced smoking enjoyment during the prequit period , with mean ( SD ) ratings of @ ( @ ) for varenicline vs @ ( @ ) for placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	It had no effect on the mean ( SD ) frequency of urges to smoke at @ week after the TQD , their strength , or the severity of withdrawal symptoms : these ratings for varenicline vs placebo were @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) ( P = @ ) , @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) ( P = @ ) , and @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) ( P = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The dose increase also had no effect on smoking cessation rates for varenicline vs placebo at @ week ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ) , @ weeks ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ) , and @ weeks ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ) after the TQD .
RESULTS	There was significantly more nausea ( P < @ ) and vomiting ( P < @ ) reported in the varenicline arm than in the placebo arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Increasing varenicline dose in smokers with low response to the drug had no significant effect on tobacco withdrawal symptoms or smoking cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	Physicians often consider increasing the medication dose if there is no response to the standard dosage .
CONCLUSIONS	This approach may not work with varenicline .

BACKGROUND	The success of damage-control surgery ( DCS ) for the treatment of trauma has led to its use in other surgical problems such as abdominal sepsis .
BACKGROUND	Previous studies using direct peritoneal resuscitation ( DPR ) for the treatment of trauma have yielded promising results .
BACKGROUND	We present the results of the application of this technique to patients experiencing abdominal sepsis .
METHODS	We enrolled @ DCS patients during a @ year-period ( January @ to December @ ) into a propensity-matched study to evaluate the utility of using DPR in addition to standard resuscitation .
METHODS	DPR consisted of peritoneal lavage with @ % DELFLEX , and abdominal closure was standardized across both groups .
METHODS	Patients were matched using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) variables .
METHODS	Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed .
RESULTS	There were no differences between the control and experimental groups with regard to age , sex , ethnicity , or APACHE II at @ hours .
RESULTS	Indications for damage control included pancreatitis , perforated hollow viscous , bowel obstruction , and ischemic enterocolitis .
RESULTS	Patients undergoing DPR had both a higher rate of ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) and a shorter time to definitive fascial closure ( @ -LSB- @ -RSB- days vs. @ -LSB- @ -RSB- days , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	DPR patients had a decreased APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score compared with the controls at @ hours .
RESULTS	In addition , DPR patients had fewer abdominal complications compared with the controls ( RR , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ventilator days and intensive care unit length of stay were both significantly reduced in the DPR group .
RESULTS	The DPR group showed a lower overall mortality at @ days ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	DPR reduces time to definitive abdominal closure , increases primary fascial closure , and reduces intra-abdominal complications following DCS .
CONCLUSIONS	DPR may also attenuate progressive physiologic injury as demonstrated by a reduction in @-hour intensive care unit severity scores .
CONCLUSIONS	As a result , DPR following DCS may afford better outcomes to patients experiencing shock .
METHODS	Therapeutic study , level III .

BACKGROUND	The importance of vitamin D on bone health and osteoporosis was studied by many researchers .
BACKGROUND	The main role of the Vitamin D is to absorb calcium and phosphate and increase bone mineralization .
BACKGROUND	Older people are at an increased risk of the inadequate vitamin D production in the skin because of lower sun exposure and reduced ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D.
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of short-term ( @ weeks ) low energy UVB irradiation in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using bone mineral density and bone turnover markers .
METHODS	A three-month , single-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the University hospital in Daegu , Republic of Korea .
METHODS	Fifty-two postmenopausal Korean women ( older than @ years ) with osteoporosis were randomly allocated to have either low energy UVB or placebo for @ minutes a day for two weeks of treatment during winter .
METHODS	Laboratory analysis and physical examination before and @ , @ and @ weeks after treatment were carried out and BMD was measured before and @ and @ weeks after treatment .
METHODS	The effects of time and treatment interaction between these two groups were evaluated by repeated-measure two-factor analysis , and subgroup analysis was performed to examine UVB effect on the vitamin D insufficient group -LSB- serum @ ( OH ) D@ concentration < @ ng/mL -RSB- .
RESULTS	In vitamin D insufficient group , the effect of UVB irradiation on vitamin D and bone ALP as well as additional benefit on bone formation was confirmed .
RESULTS	The vitamin D insufficient group showed statistically significant increment in serum @ ( OH ) D@ compared with the normal group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , there was no significant difference between two groups in the other bone turnover markers , such as serum calcium , PTH-C , serum osteocalcin , serum CTX and BMD .
CONCLUSIONS	Low-energy-short-term UVB radiation for postmenopausal women may be of use in vitamin D synthesis .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a modest benefit in change of bone ALP especially in women with the insufficient vitamin D.

OBJECTIVE	This phase II study evaluated the synthetic DNA-based immunomodulator and Toll-like receptor @ agonist MGN@ as maintenance treatment in metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( mCRC ) .
METHODS	Fifty-nine patients with mCRC and disease control after standard first-line chemotherapy were randomised to MGN@ @mg ( N = @ ) or placebo ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	The hazard ratio ( HR ) for the primary endpoint -LSB- progression-free survival ( PFS ) from the start of maintenance -RSB- was @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) by independent and investigator review , respectively .
RESULTS	MGN@ significantly improved PFS measured from the start of induction therapy versus placebo on independent ( HR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and investigator review ( HR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall survival ( OS ) data remain immature ( HR @ % ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) with @/@ patients alive after a medium follow-up of > @months .
RESULTS	Retrospective subgroup analysis showed a significant effect of MGN@ on PFS versus placebo in patients with greater than median tumour size reduction and normalised carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations following induction therapy , and in patients with elevated activated NKT cells@ @ % .
RESULTS	Adverse events were mild to moderate and limited to injection-site reactions or linked to general immune system activation .
CONCLUSIONS	MGN@ maintenance treatment was well tolerated and appears to induce durable and prolonged PFS and disease control in a subgroup of patients with mCRC following induction therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Activated NKT cells may be a predictive biomarker for selecting patients likely to benefit more from MGN@ .

BACKGROUND	Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases , affecting approximately @ % of the UK adult population .
BACKGROUND	Patients suffer considerable pain , stiffness and swelling and can sustain various degrees of joint destruction , deformity , and significant functional decline .
BACKGROUND	In addition , the economic burden due to hospitalisation and loss of employment is considerable , with over @ % of patients being work-disabled within @years of diagnosis .
BACKGROUND	Despite several biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( bDMARD ) now available , there is a lack of data to guide biologic sequencing .
BACKGROUND	In the UK , second-line biologic treatment is restricted to a single option , rituximab .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the SWITCH trial is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNF-inhibitor ( TNFi ) or abatacept are as effective as rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug .
METHODS	SWITCH is a pragmatic , phase IV , multi-centre , parallel-group design , open-label , randomised , controlled trial ( RCT ) comparing alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept with rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug .
METHODS	Participants are randomised in a @:@:@ ratio to receive alternative mechanism TNFi , ( monoclonal antibodies : infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab or golimumab or the receptor fusion protein , etanercept ) , abatacept or rituximab during the interventional phase ( from randomisation up to week @ ) .
METHODS	Participants are subsequently followed up to a maximum of @weeks , which constitutes the observational phase .
METHODS	The primary objective is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNFi or abatacept are non-inferior to rituximab in terms of disease response at @weeks post randomisation .
METHODS	The secondary objectives include the comparison of alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept to rituximab in terms of disease response , quality of life , toxicity , safety and structural and bone density outcomes over a @-month period ( @weeks ) and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching patients to alternative active therapies compared to current practice .
CONCLUSIONS	SWITCH is a well-designed trial in this therapeutic area that aims to develop a rational treatment algorithm to potentially inform personalised treatment regimens ( as opposed to switching all patients to only one available ( and possibly unsuccessful ) therapy ) , which may lead to long-term improved patient outcomes and gains in population health .

BACKGROUND	There is a need for evidence of the clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of esophageal cancer , but randomized controlled trials in surgery are often difficult to conduct .
BACKGROUND	The ROMIO ( Randomized Open or Minimally Invasive Oesophagectomy ) study will establish the feasibility of a main trial which will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive and open surgical procedures for the treatment of esophageal cancer .
METHODS	A pilot randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) , in two centers ( University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust ) will examine numbers of incident and eligible patients who consent to participate in the ROMIO study .
METHODS	Interventions will include esophagectomy by : ( @ ) open gastric mobilization and right thoracotomy , ( @ ) laparoscopic gastric mobilization and right thoracotomy , and ( @ ) totally minimally invasive surgery ( in the Bristol center only ) .
METHODS	The primary outcomes of the feasibility study will be measures of recruitment , successful development of methods to monitor quality of surgery and fidelity to a surgical protocol , and development of a core outcome set to evaluate esophageal cancer surgery .
METHODS	The study will test patient-reported outcomes measures to assess recovery , methods to blind participants , assessments of surgical morbidity , and methods to capture cost and resource use .
METHODS	ROMIO will integrate methods to monitor and improve recruitment using audio recordings of consultations between recruiting surgeons , nurses , and patients to provide feedback for recruiting staff .
CONCLUSIONS	The ROMIO study aims to establish efficient methods to undertake a main trial of minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery for esophageal cancer .

OBJECTIVE	Although some studies suggest that art therapy may be useful in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia , a recent large trial of group art therapy found no clinical advantage over standard care , but the study population was heterogeneous and uptake of the intervention was poor .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to investigate whether art therapy was more effective for specific subgroups of patients .
METHODS	Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial of group art therapy as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia ( n = @ ) versus standard care alone ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores at @ months were compared between trial arms .
METHODS	Interaction between intervention effect and different subgroups , including those with more severe negative symptoms of schizophrenia , and those who expressed a preference for art therapy prior to randomisation , was tested using a linear mixed model .
RESULTS	The clinical effectiveness of group art therapy did not significantly differ between participants with more or less severe negative symptoms -LSB- interaction for difference in PANSS = @ , @ % CI ( -@ to @ ) , P = @ -RSB- , or between those who did and did not express a preference for art therapy -LSB- interaction = @ , @ % CI ( -@ to @ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	None of the other exploratory subgroups suggested differences in intervention effect .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence of greater improvement in clinical symptoms of schizophrenia for those with more severe negative symptoms or those with a preference for art therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Identification of patients with schizophrenia who may benefit most from group art therapy remains elusive .

BACKGROUND	Serum infliximab trough levels correlate with efficacy ; dose escalation is often beneficial in patients with Crohn 's disease who stop responding to infliximab treatment .
OBJECTIVE	To carry out a post hoc analysis of A Crohn 's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New Long-term Treatment Regimen I ( ACCENT I ) to evaluate the association between serum infliximab trough levels and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) after @weeks of induction treatment with durable sustained long-term response ( Crohn 's Disease Activity Index decrease @ points and reduction @ % from baseline ) .
METHODS	ACCENT I was a multicentre , randomised , placebo-controlled study .
METHODS	Week @ trough levels and CRP percentage decrease from baseline to week @ were compared between patients with and without durable sustained response through week @ .
METHODS	Sensitivity and specificity were determined to predict durable sustained response .
METHODS	Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves identified optimal cut-off points ; logistic regression determined ORs .
RESULTS	After induction with @mg/kg infliximab , @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) of patients sustained week @ response to infliximab @ or @mg/kg , respectively , administered every @weeks without dose escalation , through week @ .
RESULTS	Median week @ trough levels of patients with and without durable sustained response to infliximab @mg/kg were @ and @ g/mL , respectively ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Optimal predictors of durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab @mg/kg were week @ trough level @ g/mL and @ % CRP decrease ( ORs ( @ % CI ) , @ ( @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) ) , respectively , in patients with raised baseline CRP ( > @ mg/L ) ; area under the ROC curve was @ for both predictors .
RESULTS	A @ g/mL week @ infliximab serum level did not predict durable sustained response to @mg/kg maintenance infliximab .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab @mg/kg had higher postinduction trough levels than patients without durable sustained response .
CONCLUSIONS	Serum infliximab trough levels @ g/mL and @ % CRP decrease were significantly associated with durable sustained response .

BACKGROUND	It is uncertain whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation who need an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that forgoing bridging anticoagulation would be noninferior to bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of perioperative arterial thromboembolism and would be superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding .
METHODS	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which , after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy , patients were randomly assigned to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin ( @ IU of dalteparin per kilogram of body weight ) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously twice daily , from @ days before the procedure until @ hours before the procedure and then for @ to @ days after the procedure .
METHODS	Warfarin treatment was stopped @ days before the procedure and was resumed within @ hours after the procedure .
METHODS	Follow-up of patients continued for @ days after the procedure .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism ( stroke , systemic embolism , or transient ischemic attack ) and major bleeding .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients were enrolled , with @ assigned to receive no bridging therapy and @ assigned to receive bridging therapy .
RESULTS	The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was @ % in the no-bridging group and @ % in the bridging group ( risk difference , @ percentage points ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ to @ ; P = @ for noninferiority ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of major bleeding was @ % in the no-bridging group and @ % in the bridging group ( relative risk , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ for superiority ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure , forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding .

OBJECTIVE	The Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment ( START ) trial has recruited antiretroviral-nave individuals with high CD@ cell counts from all regions of the world .
OBJECTIVE	We describe the distribution of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors , overall and by geographical region , at study baseline .
METHODS	The distribution of CVD risk factors was assessed and compared by geographical region among START participants who had a baseline electrocardiogram ( n = @ ; North America , @ % ; Europe/Australia/Israel , @ % ; South America , @ % ; Asia , @ % ; Africa , @ % ; median age @ years ; @ % female ) .
RESULTS	About @ % ( n = @ ) of the participants had at least one CVD risk factor and @ % ( n = @ ) had two or more .
RESULTS	The most common CVD risk factors were current smoking ( @ % ) , hypertension ( @ % ) and obesity ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	There were significant differences in the prevalence of CVD risk factors among geographical regions .
RESULTS	The prevalence of at least one risk factor across regions was as follows : North America , @ % ; Europe/Australia/Israel , @ % ; South America , @ % ; Asia , @ % ; Africa , @ % ( P-value < @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant regional differences were also observed when risk factors were used as part of the Framingham and Data Collection on Adverse events of Anti-HIV Drugs ( D : A :D ) risk scores or used to define a favourable risk profile .
CONCLUSIONS	CVD risk factors are common among START participants , and their distribution varies by geographical region .
CONCLUSIONS	Better understanding of how and why CVD risk factors develop in people with HIV infection and their geographical distributions could shed light on appropriate strategies for CVD prevention and may inform the interpretation of the results of START , as CVD is expected to be a major fraction of the primary endpoints observed .

BACKGROUND	This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate whether the serum procalcitonin ( PCT ) level can be utilized to guide the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma .
METHODS	A total of @ consecutive patients with suspected asthma attacks from February @ to July @ participated in this study .
METHODS	@ patients completed the study .
METHODS	Serum PCT levels , and other inflammatory biomarkers of all patients were measured .
METHODS	In addition to the standard treatment , the control group received antibiotics according to the attending physicians ' discretions , while the patients in the PCT group were treated with antibiotics according to serum PCT concentrations .
METHODS	Antibiotics usage was strongly discouraged when the PCT concentration was below @ g/L ; discouraged when the PCT concentration was between @ g/L and @ g/L ; or encouraged when the PCT concentration was above @ g/L .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the determination of antibiotics usage .
METHODS	The second endpoints included the diagnostic accuracy of PCT and other laboratory biomarkers the effectiveness of asthma control , secondary ED visits , hospital re-admissions , repeated needs for steroids or dosage increase , needs for antibiotics , WBC count , PCT levels and FEV@ % .
RESULTS	At baseline , two groups were identical regarding clinical , laboratory and symptom score .
RESULTS	Probability of the antibiotics usage in the PCT group ( @ % ) was lower than that in the control group ( @ % ) ( @ = @ , p < @ .
RESULTS	RR = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	PCT and IL-@ showed good diagnostic significance for bacterial asthma ( r = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The degrees of asthma control in patients were categorized to three levels and were comparable between the two groups at the six weeks follow-up period ( @ = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant difference regarding other secondary outcomes ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The serum PCT concentration can be used to effectively determine whether the acute asthma patients have bacterial infections in the respiratory tract , and to guide the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations , which may substantially reduce unnecessary antibiotic use without compromising the therapeutic outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	The SYMPLICITY HTN-@ randomized , blinded , sham-controlled trial confirmed the safety of renal denervation ( RDN ) , but did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint .
OBJECTIVE	Prior RDN studies have demonstrated significant and durable reductions in blood pressure .
OBJECTIVE	This analysis investigated factors that may help explain these disparate results .
RESULTS	Patients with resistant hypertension were randomized @ : @ to RDN ( n = @ ) or sham ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was the difference in office systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) change at @ months .
RESULTS	A multivariable analysis identified predictors of SBP change .
RESULTS	Additional analyses examined the influence of medication changes , results in selected subgroups and procedural factors .
RESULTS	Between randomization and the @-month endpoint , @ % of patients underwent medication changes .
RESULTS	Predictors of office SBP reduction at @ months were baseline office SBP @ mmHg , aldosterone antagonist use , and non-use of vasodilators ; number of ablations was a predictor in the RDN group .
RESULTS	Non-African-American patients receiving RDN had a significantly greater change in office SBP than those receiving sham ; -@ @ vs. -@ @ mmHg , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Greater reductions in office and ambulatory SBP , and heart rate were observed with a higher number of ablations and energy delivery in a four-quadrant pattern .
CONCLUSIONS	Post hoc analyses , although derived from limited patient cohorts , reveal several potential confounding factors that may partially explain the unexpected blood pressure responses in both the sham control and RDN groups .
CONCLUSIONS	These hypothesis-generating data further inform the design of subsequent research to evaluate the potential role of RDN in the treatment of resistant hypertension .

OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that patients with soft tissue changes related to superficial venous insufficiency ( SVI ) have greater benefits from treatment than those with only symptomatic varicose veins .
BACKGROUND	A commonly held view is that SVI is only a minor ailment , yet randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) show that treatment improves quality of life ( QoL ) and is cost-effective .
BACKGROUND	In an effort to curb the treatment costs of this common disorder , rationing is applied in many health care systems , often limiting the reimbursement of treatment to those with soft tissue changes .
METHODS	This cohort study draws its data from an interventional RCT .
METHODS	After informed consent , consecutive patients with symptomatic unilateral SVI were randomized to receive surgical ligation and stripping or endovenous laser ablation .
METHODS	This analysis differentially studies the outcomes of patients with simple varicose veins ( C@ : n = @ ) and soft tissue complications ( C@-@ : n = @ ) .
METHODS	Effectiveness outcomes measured up to @ year included the following : Qol -LSB- short form @ ( SF@ ) , EuroQol , and the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire -RSB- , clinical recurrence , and the need for secondary procedures .
METHODS	Multivariable regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding factors .
RESULTS	Both groups saw significant improvements in QoL .
RESULTS	All improvements were equal between groups apart from the SF@ domain of Bodily Pain , where C@ saw an improvement of @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @-@ @ -RSB- points over C@-@ participants ( P = @ ) , who also suffered more recurrence -LSB- odds ratio ( OR ) = @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P = @ -RSB- and required more secondary procedures ( OR = @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that rationing by clinical severity contradicts the evidence .
CONCLUSIONS	Delaying treatment until the development of skin damage leads to a degree of irreversible morbidity and greater recurrence .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether addition of an electronic sepsis evaluation and management tool to electronic sepsis alerting improves compliance with treatment guidelines and clinical outcomes in septic ICU patients .
METHODS	A pragmatic randomized trial .
METHODS	Medical and surgical ICUs of an academic , tertiary care medical center .
METHODS	Four hundred and seven patients admitted during a @-month period to the medical or surgical ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis established at the time of admission or in response to an electronic sepsis alert .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to usual care or the availability of an electronic tool capable of importing , synthesizing , and displaying sepsis-related data from the medical record , using logic rules to offer individualized evaluations of sepsis severity and response to therapy , informing users about evidence-based guidelines , and facilitating rapid order entry .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the electronic tool ( @ patients ) and usual care ( @ patients ) with regard to the primary outcome of time to completion of all indicated Surviving Sepsis Campaign @-hour Sepsis Resuscitation Bundle elements ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) or time to completion of each element individually .
RESULTS	ICU mortality , ICU-free days , and ventilator-free days did not differ between intervention and control .
RESULTS	Providers used the tool to enter orders in only @ % of available cases .
CONCLUSIONS	A comprehensive electronic sepsis evaluation and management tool is feasible and safe but did not influence guideline compliance or clinical outcomes , perhaps due to low utilization .

BACKGROUND	Studies that have examined the impact of a physical activity intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors have yielded conflicting results .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a standardized physical activity program on adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors in schoolchildren .
METHODS	Cluster randomized trial study of @ schoolchildren , @-@ years , from @ public schools in the Province of Cuenca , Spain .
METHODS	The intervention ( MOVI-@ ) consisted of play-based and non-competitive activities .
METHODS	MOVI-@ was conducted during two @-minute sessions on weekdays and one @-minute session on Saturday mornings every week between September @ and May @ .
METHODS	We measured changes in adiposity ( overweight/obesity prevalence , body mass index -LSB- BMI -RSB- , triceps skinfold thickness -LSB- TST -RSB- , body fat % , fat-free mass , waist circumference ) and other cardiometabolic risk factors ( LDL-cholesterol , triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol ratio , insulin , C-reactive protein and blood pressure ) .
METHODS	The analyses used mixed regression models to adjust for baseline covariates under cluster randomization .
RESULTS	Among girls , we found a reduction of adiposity in intervention versus control schools , with a decrease in TST ( -@ mm ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- -@ to -@ ) , body fat % ( -@ % ; @ % CI -@ to -@ ) , waist circumference ( -@ cm ; @ % CI -@ to -@ ) , and an increase in fat-free mass ( @ kg ; @ % CI @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The intervention also led to lower serum LDL-cholesterol and insulin levels .
RESULTS	Among boys , a reduction in waist circumference ( -@ cm ; @ % CI -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) , and an increase in fat-free mass ( @ kg ; @ % CI @ to @ ; P = @ ) was associated with the intervention versus control schools .
RESULTS	The prevalence of overweight/obesity or underweight , BMI , and other cardiometabolic risk factors was not modified by the intervention .
RESULTS	No important adverse events were registered .
CONCLUSIONS	An extracurricular intervention of non-competitive physical activity during an academic year , targeting all schoolchildren regardless of body weight , is a safe and effective measure to reduce adiposity in both genders and to improve cardiometabolic risk profile in girls .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated potential biomarkers of efficacy in a phase III trial of sunitinib versus interferon-alpha ( IFN - ) , first-line in metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) , by analyzing plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) - A , VEGF-C , soluble VEGF receptor-@ ( sVEGFR-@ ) and interleukin ( IL ) -@ .
METHODS	Seven hundred and fifty mRCC patients were randomized to oral sunitinib @ mg/day in repeated cycles of a @-week on/@-week off schedule or IFN - @ million units subcutaneously thrice weekly .
METHODS	Plasma samples collected from a subset of @ patients on days @ and @ of cycles @-@ and at end of treatment were analyzed by ELISA .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics of biomarker-evaluated patients in sunitinib ( N = @ ) and IFN - ( N = @ ) arms were comparable to their respective intent-to-treat populations .
RESULTS	By univariate Cox regression analysis , low baseline soluble protein levels were associated with lower risk of progression/death ( all P < @ ) : in both treatment arms , baseline VEGF-A and IL-@ were associated with overall survival ( OS ) and baseline VEGF-C with progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; in the sunitinib arm , baseline VEGF-A was associated with PFS and baseline sVEGFR-@ with PFS and OS ; in the IFN - arm , baseline IL-@ was associated with PFS .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , baseline sVEGFR-@ and IL-@ remained independent predictors of OS in the sunitinib arm , while no independent predictors of outcome remained in the IFN - arm .
RESULTS	Pharmacodynamic changes were not associated with PFS or OS for any plasma protein investigated .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that , in mRCC , baseline VEGF-A and IL-@ may have prognostic value , while baseline sVEGFR-@ may predict sunitinib efficacy .

METHODS	Regressions were used to test cumulative kilocalories and protein as the predictors of @-day change in weight and length z scores ( growth status ) , and to evaluate protein tolerance .
RESULTS	Average intake was @ @ kcal kg ( -@ ) day ( -@ ) and @ @ g protein kg ( -@ ) day ( -@ ) , with @ @ g kg ( -@ ) day ( -@ ) and @ @ cm/week growth for @ days .
RESULTS	Cumulative total kilocalories and protein were significant predictors of improved length z score ( P = @ , @ ) but not weight z score change .
RESULTS	Regression models indicated that protein not kilocalories explained the improvement in length z score , with protein explaining @ % of the variability .
RESULTS	The high protein group averaged @ to @ g kg ( -@ ) day ( -@ ) ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Protein tolerance was adequate for all of the study infants based on metabolic measures ( blood urea nitrogen , serum carbon dioxide , pH ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher cumulative protein intake was tolerated and overall lessened the commonly occurring decline in the length but not weight growth status in a @-day study of preterm infants .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate whether ingestion of fructose and fructans ( such as inulin ) can exacerbate irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) symptoms .
OBJECTIVE	The aim was to better understand the origin of these symptoms by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the gut .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy volunteers participated in a four-way , randomized , single-blind , crossover study in which they consumed @ml of water containing @g of either glucose , fructose , inulin , or a @:@ mixture of @g glucose and @g fructose .
METHODS	MRI scans were performed hourly for @h , assessing the volume of gastric contents , small bowel water content ( SBWC ) , and colonic gas .
METHODS	Breath hydrogen ( H@ ) was measured and symptoms recorded after each scan .
RESULTS	Data are reported as mean ( s.d. ) ( @ % CI ) when normally distributed and median ( range ) when not .
RESULTS	Fructose increased area under the curve ( AUC ) from @-@h of SBWC to @ ( @ ) l/min , significantly greater than for glucose at @ ( @-@ ) l/min ( P < @ ) , whereas AUC SBWC after inulin , @ ( @-@ ) l/min , was no different from that after glucose .
RESULTS	Adding glucose to fructose decreased AUC SBWC to @ ( @ ) l/min ( P = @ ) vs. fructose .
RESULTS	Inulin substantially increased AUC colonic gas to @ ( @ ) l/min , significantly greater than glucose and glucose + fructose ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Breath H@ rose more with inulin than with fructose .
RESULTS	Glucose when combined with fructose significantly reduced breath H@ by @,@ ( @,@-@ ,@ ) p.p.m. / min relative to fructose alone ( P < @ , n = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Fructose but not inulin distends the small bowel with water .
CONCLUSIONS	Adding glucose to fructose reduces the effect of fructose on SBWC and breath hydrogen .
CONCLUSIONS	Inulin distends the colon with gas more than fructose , but causes few symptoms in healthy volunteers .

BACKGROUND	While many of the commonly used conservative treatments for knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) have been recognized to be effective , there is still insufficient evidence available .
BACKGROUND	Among the pharmacological treatments for knee OA , oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) act rapidly and are recommended for the management of OA .
BACKGROUND	However , frequent and serious adverse effects of NSAIDs have been recognized .
BACKGROUND	Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid ( IA-HA ) for the treatment of knee OA have been shown to reduce pain and improve joint function .
BACKGROUND	However , there has been no qualified direct comparison study of the efficacy and safety between IA-HA and NSAIDs for patients with knee OA .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy and safety of early-phase IA-HA in comparison to those of NSAIDs for patients with knee OA .
METHODS	This multicenter , randomized , open-label , parallel-group , non-inferiority comparison study with an oral NSAID involved a total of @ patients with knee OA .
METHODS	An independent , computer-generated randomization sequence was used to randomly assign patients in a @:@ ratio to NSAIDs three times per day for five weeks ( n = @ ) or IA-HA once a week for five weeks ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the percentage change in the patient-oriented outcome measure for knee OA , the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure ( JKOM ) score .
METHODS	All patients were questioned regarding any adverse events during treatment .
METHODS	The full analysis set ( FAS ) was used for analysis .
METHODS	The margin of non-inferiority was @ % .
RESULTS	The analyses of primary endpoint included @ patients in the IA-HA group and @ patients in the NSAID group .
RESULTS	The difference in the percentage changes of the JKOM score between the two intervention arms ( IA-HA ; -@ % ( P < @ ) , NSAID ; -@ % ( P < @ ) ) was -@ % ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : -@ to @ ) , indicating IA-HA was not inferior to NSAID .
RESULTS	The frequency of both withdrawal and adverse events in the IA-HA group were significantly lower than those in the NSAID group ( P = @ and @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The early efficacy of IA-HA is suggested to be not inferior to that of NSAIDs , and that the safety of the early phase of IA-HA is superior to that of NSAIDs for patients with knee OA .

BACKGROUND	Two randomized intraoperative radiation therapy trials for early-stage breast cancer were recently published .
BACKGROUND	The ELIOT Trial used electrons ( IOERT ) , and the TARGIT-A Trial Update used @-kV X-rays ( IORT ) .
BACKGROUND	These studies were compared for similarities and differences .
BACKGROUND	The results were analyzed and used to determine which patients might be suitable for single-dose treatment .
METHODS	The primary sources of data were the ELIOT Trial and TARGIT-A Trial , as well as a comprehensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature of accelerated partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) using @-kV X-rays or electrons .
METHODS	Studies published or presented prior to March @ were analyzed for efficacy , patient restrictions , complications , and outcome .
RESULTS	With a median follow-up of @ years , the @-year recurrence rates for ELIOT versus external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) patients were @ % and @ % , respectively , p = @ .
RESULTS	A low-risk ELIOT group was identified with a @-year recurrence rate of @ % .
RESULTS	With a median follow-up of @months , the @-year recurrence rates for the TARGIT-A versus EBRT patients were @ % and @ % , respectively , p = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	With @ years of median follow-up , IOERT appears to have a subset of low-risk women for whom IOERT is acceptable .
CONCLUSIONS	With @months of median follow-up the results of IORT with @-kV devices are promising , but longer follow-up data are required .
CONCLUSIONS	At the current time , single-fraction IOERT or IORT patients should be treated under strict institutional protocols .

OBJECTIVE	To examine whether baseline obesity severity modifies the effects of two different , primary care-based , technology-enhanced lifestyle interventions among overweight or obese adults with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome .
METHODS	We compared mean differences in changes from baseline to @ months in clinical measures of general and central obesity among participants randomized to usual care alone ( n = @ ) or usual care plus a coach-led group ( n = @ ) or self-directed individual ( n = @ ) intervention , stratified by baseline body mass index ( BMI ) category .
RESULTS	Participants with baseline BMI @ + had greater reductions in mean BMI , body weight ( as percentage change ) , and waist circumference in the coach-led group intervention , compared to usual care and the self-directed individual intervention ( P < @ for all ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , the self-directed intervention was more effective than usual care only among participants with baseline BMIs between @ @ .
RESULTS	Mean weight loss exceeded @ % in the coach-led intervention regardless of baseline BMI category , but this was achieved only among self-directed intervention participants with baseline BMIs < @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Baseline BMI may influence behavioral weight-loss treatment effectiveness .
CONCLUSIONS	Researchers and clinicians should take an individual 's baseline BMI into account when developing or recommending lifestyle focused treatment strategy .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Patients ' reported opinions of the health system need to be understood in order to provide patient-centered care .
BACKGROUND	We investigated determinants of women 's ratings of the quality of care during their most recent facility delivery .
METHODS	We conducted a census of all deliveries in the @ weeks to @ months preceding the survey , in villages served by @ primary care clinics in rural Pwani Region , Tanzania .
METHODS	Women who had delivered children in a study facility were included in this analysis ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	We interviewed women about demographic and obstetric factors and the quality of their obstetric care using a structured questionnaire .
METHODS	We created a composite index of perceived quality from six quality questions .
METHODS	We also assessed the functioning of the local health clinic using structured surveys .
METHODS	We used a multi-level model to analyze factors associated with women 's rating of the quality of care during delivery .
RESULTS	@ % of respondents rated the overall quality of care received during delivery as excellent .
RESULTS	Women who listened to the radio daily reported lower quality composite scores ( : -@ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Women who reported receiving more services in ANC had higher quality scores ( : @ , p = @ ) , as did women receiving more delivery services ( : @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Women who reported disrespect and abuse during delivery had significantly lower quality scores ( : -@ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A woman 's expectations and prior and current experiences influence her perception of the quality of care she received .
CONCLUSIONS	Health facility characteristics did not influence ratings of overall quality .
CONCLUSIONS	Focusing on improving the process rather than inputs of service delivery during ANC visits and delivery may increase perceived quality of delivery care in low-resource settings .

BACKGROUND	There is a lack of knowledge about antidementia drug treatment in community dwelling people with dementia in Germany .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the frequency of treatment with antidementia drugs in patients in primary care , and the socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with antidementia drug treatment .
METHODS	Present analyses are based on preliminary data from the DelpHi-trial , an ongoing GP-based , cluster-randomized , controlled intervention trial to implement and evaluate an innovative concept of collaborative dementia care management in Germany .
METHODS	Our sample consists of n = @ subjects who screened positive for dementia .
RESULTS	@ % ( n = @ ) of participants received antidementia drugs : memantine @ % ( n = @ ) ; donepezil @ % ( n = @ ) ; rivastigmine @ % ( n = @ ) ; galantamine @ % ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ % ( n = @ ) of the subgroup of participants with a formal dementia diagnosis received antidementia drug treatment .
RESULTS	Approximately @ % ( n = @ ) of our sample received treatment with antidementia drugs without having a formal diagnosis .
RESULTS	Treatment with antidementia drugs was significantly associated with more severe cognitive impairment and having a formal dementia diagnosis .
CONCLUSIONS	One in three people who screened positive for dementia in primary care received antidementia drug treatment , indicating the frequent use of this class of drugs .
CONCLUSIONS	For those with a formal dementia diagnosis , these drug treatment rates are more than triple , compared to those in nursing homes .

BACKGROUND	Internet-delivered trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious for PTSD ; however , no studies have investigated the roles of individual treatment components or the safety of online treatments .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of an online treatment for PTSD comprised of psychoeducation , stress management , cognitive restructuring and exposure components with the equivalent protocol without the exposure components , using a randomised controlled trial design .
METHODS	Sixty-six individuals were randomised to a non-exposure condition and @ to the full protocol with exposure components .
METHODS	Treatment duration was @ weeks and pre - , post-treatment and three-month follow-up outcomes were analysed using a mixed linear modelling approach .
RESULTS	Both groups achieved improvements in symptoms with no differences between groups on any primary or secondary outcome measures , diagnostic remission rates or adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	The study included several secondary measures that have not been previously validated and treatments were not time matched in terms of number of lessons .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings indicate that trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy for PTSD with or without exposure components can be safe and efficacious .

OBJECTIVE	Epidemiological research links aggression to low serum concentrations of omega-@ fatty acids , such as those found in fish oil .
OBJECTIVE	However , no studies have specifically examined whether fish oil supplementation can reduce the frequency and severity of impulsive aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders .
METHODS	Children presenting with impulsive aggression and meeting research criteria for diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders were randomized to receive either : @ ) Fish oil capsules ( @g daily ) for @ weeks followed by placebo ( identical-looking capsules ) for @ weeks ; or @ ) placebo for @ weeks , followed by fish oil for @ weeks , in a double-blind , crossover design .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were the Children 's Aggression Scale and the Modified Overt Aggression Scale .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included emotional and behavioral functioning ( Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire -LSB- SDQ -RSB- ) , hyperactivity symptoms ( Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder -LSB- ADHD -RSB- Rating Scale ) , family functioning ( Family Assessment Device ) , and cognitive functioning ( Stop Signal Task , Trail-Making Task , and Eriksen Flanker Task ) .
METHODS	Serum concentrations of omega-@ and omega-@ fatty acids were measured at baseline , and at @ and @ weeks .
RESULTS	Twenty-one children participated ( @ % male ; mean age @ years ; range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Fish oil treatment increased serum concentrations of eicosapentanoic acid ( F = @ , p < @ ) and total omega-@s ( F = @ , p < @ ) , but did not influence primary ratings of aggression .
RESULTS	In fact , a trend suggested that fish oil worsened a secondary measure of aggression ( SDQ Conduct Subscale , F = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fish oil treatment was associated with an improvement in one rating of hyperactivity ( SDQ Hyperactivity Subscale , F = @ , p < @ ) , but did not influence any other outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that fish oil treatment does not improve aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders .

BACKGROUND	Non-attenders for cervical screening are at increased risk of cervical cancer .
BACKGROUND	Studies offering self-sampling for high-risk Human Papillomavirus ( HrHPV ) testing have shown greater uptake than sending another invitation for cytology .
OBJECTIVE	To explore whether uptake would increase in a less diverse , more stable population than the previous English study , which demonstrated a lower response rate than other studies .
OBJECTIVE	The primary objective was whether non-attenders were more likely to respond to a postal invitation , including kit , to collect a self-sample compared with a further invitation for cytology screening .
OBJECTIVE	The secondary objective was whether women with an abnormal result would attend for follow-up .
METHODS	@ non-attenders for screening in this pragmatic , randomized ( @:@ ) controlled trial in Newcastle-upon-Tyne were sent an HPV self-sample kit ( intervention ) or a further invitation for cytology screening ( comparator ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) responded to the intervention , returning a self-sample ( @ ( @ % ) ) or attending for cytology ( @ ( @ % ) ) , compared with @ ( @ % ) attending for cytology , relative risk @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) ( comparator arm ) .
RESULTS	Of those testing hrHPV positive ( @ ( @ % ) ) , @ ( @ % ) subsequently attended cytology screening .
RESULTS	Of those in the intervention group who attended for cytology screening without returning an hrHPV self-sample ( n = @ ) , @ % ( n = @ ) were referred for colposcopy-all attended .
RESULTS	In the comparator group eight of the nine referred for colposcopy attended .
CONCLUSIONS	Persistent non-responders to invitations for cervical screening are significantly more likely to respond to a postal invitation to return a self-collected sample for HPV testing than a further invitation for cytology screening .
CONCLUSIONS	However , just over half followed up on this positive HPV result .

OBJECTIVE	To examine how the location where reading takes place and the availability of prior images can affect performance in breast test-set reading .
METHODS	Under optimized viewing conditions , @ expert screen readers each interpreted a reader-specific set of images containing @ mammographic cases .
METHODS	Readers , randomly divided into two groups read images under one of two pairs of conditions : clinical read with prior images and laboratory read with prior images ; laboratory read with prior images and laboratory read without prior images .
METHODS	Region-of-interest ( ROI ) figure-of-merit ( FOM ) was analysed using JAFROC software .
METHODS	Breast side-specific sensitivity and specificity were tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests .
METHODS	Agreement between pairs of readings was measured using Kendall 's coefficient of concordance .
RESULTS	Group performances between test-set readings demonstrated similar ROI FOMs , sensitivity and specificity median values , and acceptable levels of agreement between pairs of readings were shown ( W = @-@ @ , p < @ ) for both pairs of reading conditions .
RESULTS	On an individual reader level , two readers demonstrated significant decreases ( p < @ ) in ROI FOMs when prior images were unavailable .
RESULTS	Reading location had an inconsistent impact on individual performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Reading location and availability of prior images did not significantly alter group performance .

BACKGROUND	Effective strategies for contacting and recruiting study participants are critical in conducting clinical research .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we conducted two sequential randomized controlled trials of mail - and telephone-based strategies for contacting and recruiting participants , and evaluated participant-related variables ' association with time to survey completion and survey completion rates .
BACKGROUND	Subjects eligible for this study were survivors of acute lung injury who had been previously enrolled in a @-month observational follow-up study evaluating their physical , cognitive and mental health outcomes , with their last study visit completed at a median of @ months previously .
METHODS	Eligible subjects were contacted to complete a new research survey as part of two randomized trials , initially using a randomized mail-based contact strategy , followed by a randomized telephone-based contact strategy for non-responders to the mail strategy .
METHODS	Both strategies focused on using either a personalized versus a generic approach .
METHODS	In addition , @ potentially relevant subject-related variables ( e.g. , demographics , last known physical and mental health status ) were evaluated for association with time to survey completion .
RESULTS	Of @ eligible subjects , @ % completed the survey with a median ( IQR ) of @ ( @ , @ ) contact attempts required .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the time to survey completion for either randomized trial of mail - or phone-based contact strategy .
RESULTS	Among all subject-related variables , age @ years and minority race were independently associated with a longer time to survey completion .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that age @ years and minority race were associated with a longer time to survey completion , but personalized versus generic approaches to mail - and telephone-based contact strategies had no significant effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Repeating both mail and telephone contact attempts was important for increasing survey completion rate .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to compare the pain rating scale measurements from an exposure group ( injections with the aid of DentalVibe Injection Comfort System ) and control group ( traditional injection without the aid of the DentalVibe ) in adolescent patients using self-reported pain during administration of local anesthetic injections .
METHODS	This was a randomized , controlled study .
METHODS	Subjects consisted of @ @ - to @-year-old patients who required local anesthesia for dental treatment on both sides of the maxilla or mandible .
METHODS	All subjects received a conventional injection ( control ) and an injection using DentalVibe ( experimental ) .
METHODS	A pain rating for each injection was obtained from subjects using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale .
RESULTS	Statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank test found a significant reduction in pain ratings for injections with the DentalVibe when compared to control injections .
RESULTS	There was a positive correlation between the pain rating for control injection and the difference between the two types of injection , indicating that subjects who reported a higher pain score with the control injection had a greater reduction when DentalVibe was used .
CONCLUSIONS	When compared to a conventional approach , DentalVibe significantly lowered self-reported pain during local anesthesia injection for adolescent subjects in this study .

BACKGROUND	Recent recommendations for lung protective mechanical ventilation include a tidal volume target of @ mL/kg predicted body weight ( PBW ) .
BACKGROUND	Different PBW equations might introduce important differences in tidal volumes delivered to research subjects and patients .
METHODS	PBW equations use height , age , and sex as input variables .
METHODS	We compared National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) ARDS Network ( ARDSNet ) , actuarial table ( ACTUARIAL ) , and Stewart ( STEWART ) PBW equations used in clinical trials , across physiologic ranges for age and height .
METHODS	We used three-dimensional and two-dimensional surface analysis to compare these PBW equations .
METHODS	We then used age and height from actual clinical trial subjects to quantify PBW equation differences .
RESULTS	Significant potential differences existed between these PBW predictions .
RESULTS	The ACTUARIAL and ARDSNet surfaces for women were the only surfaces that intersected and produced both positive and negative differences .
RESULTS	Mathematical differences between PBW equations at limits of height and age exceeded @ % in women and @ % in men for ACTUARIAL vs ARDSNet and about @ % for women and @ % for men for STEWART vs ARDSNet .
RESULTS	The largest mathematical differences were present in older , shorter subjects , especially women .
RESULTS	Actual differences for clinical trial subjects were as high as @ % for men and @ % for women .
CONCLUSIONS	Significant differences between PBW equations for both men and women could be important sources of interstudy variation .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies should adopt a standard PBW equation .
CONCLUSIONS	We recommend using the NIH National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ARDS Network PBW equation because it is associated with the clinical trial that identified @ mL/kg PBW as an appropriate target .

OBJECTIVE	The authors examined the impacts of whole-body vibration ( WBV ) applications on balance control in postmenopausal women using clinical balance tests and computerized static posturography .
METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated with WBV and/or home-based balance coordination exercises ( BCEs ) .
METHODS	Patients in the WBV-BCE group were asked to stand on the platform in standing , squat , and deep squat positions .
METHODS	During each position , @-sec vibration ( @-@ Hz ) and @-sec rest periods were applied twice ( @ sessions in total ) .
METHODS	The BCE program was performed by subjects twice per day .
METHODS	All subjects were evaluated before and after treatment using the Timed Up and Go test and the Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) .
METHODS	The fall index and the Fourier index were assessed via computerized static posturography .
RESULTS	Sixty patients were recruited for the study , but only @ patients ( @ in each group ) completed it .
RESULTS	Fall index and the total values of the Fourier index @-@ and Fourier index @-@ frequencies indicated a significant improvement in the WBV-BCE group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Both groups showed significant improvements in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go test ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The ease of applying WBV furthermore supports its inclusion in daily treatment protocols for age-related decline in balance performance in women and improved balance and mobility measures associated with increased fall risk .

BACKGROUND	There is controversy in medical literature regarding the use of electromagnetic fields to promote bone healing .
METHODS	After designing and building devices capable of generating an electromagnetic field for this study , their safety was confirmed and the electromagnetic therapy was randomly allocated and compared to placebo in patients with fracture of the femoral diaphysis .
METHODS	Treatment began six weeks after the fracture and it was administered once a day , during @ h , for eight consecutive weeks .
METHODS	Twenty device were built , @ of which were placebo-devices .
METHODS	Between June @ and October @ , @ patients were randomized in two different hospitals and were followed for @ weeks .
METHODS	The mean age was @ years ( @-@ ) and @ % were males .
RESULTS	Healing observed at week @ was @ % vs. @ % ( p = @ ) ; at week @ it was @ % vs. @ % ( p = @ ) ; and at week @ it was @ % vs. @ % ( p = @ ) for the device group and the placebo group , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that an electromagnetic field stimulus can promote earlier bone healing compared to placebo in femoral diaphyseal fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	Faster bone healing translates into sooner weight bearing , which -- in turn -- permits quicker return to normal daily activities .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to assess in healthy subjects the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of ponesimod , an oral selective sphingosine-@-phosphate receptor @ ( S@P@ ) modulator in development for multiple sclerosis , by using an uptitration scheme up to supratherapeutic doses .
METHODS	This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised , parallel group , uptitration study .
METHODS	Male and female subjects received ascending oral doses of ponesimod ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) once daily for @ days at each dose level ( @-@-@-@-@-@mg ) .
RESULTS	The most frequent adverse events were chest discomfort , headache , dizziness , dyspnoea , abdominal pain , and night sweats .
RESULTS	Chest discomfort and dyspnoea were considered dose-limiting .
RESULTS	A transient decrease in heart rate was observed following the first @-mg ponesimod dose ( maximum mean decrease of @ beats per minute ( bpm ) ( placebo : @ bpm ) ) .
RESULTS	After uptitration , effects on heart rate were indistinguishable from placebo .
RESULTS	A dose-dependent effect on pulmonary function tests was observed and reached a plateau with @-@ mg ponesimod ( maximum mean decrease from baseline of @ l ( -@ % ) in forced expiratory volume in @s ) .
RESULTS	A plateau in mean lymphocyte count reduction of approximately @ % from baseline was reached at the @ mg dose level .
RESULTS	Observed effects were fully reversible within @days after treatment discontinuation .
RESULTS	No relevant sex differences were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	At supratherapeutic doses , symptoms of chest discomfort and dyspnoea were dose-limiting .
CONCLUSIONS	An uptitration dosing scheme is to be preferred in clinical studies in patients in order to limit effects of ponesimod on heart rate and atrioventricular ( AV ) conduction .

BACKGROUND	A recent meta-analysis of Internet interventions for smoking cessation found mixed evidence regarding effectiveness .
BACKGROUND	One explanation may be differential use of non-assigned cessation treatments-including other Internet programs-that either amplify or mask study intervention effects .
BACKGROUND	We examined the impact of non-assigned treatment use on cessation outcomes in The iQUITT Study , a randomized trial of Internet and telephone treatment for smoking cessation .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to a basic Internet ( BI ) comparison condition ( N = @ ) , enhanced Internet ( EI : N = @ ) , or EI plus telephone counseling ( EI+P : N = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was @-day point prevalence abstinence ( ppa ) at @ and @ months .
METHODS	Assigned intervention use was assessed with automated tracking data .
METHODS	Assessment of non-assigned treatments included pharmacotherapy , behavioral , alternative , and non-study Internet treatments .
METHODS	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models examined whether non-assigned treatment use was associated with @-day ppa .
RESULTS	About @ % of participants used at least one non-assigned treatment .
RESULTS	A higher rate of non-study Internet treatment among BI participants was the only treatment group difference at both @ and @ months .
RESULTS	Multivariate models controlling for condition and baseline predictors of non-assigned treatment use showed that high-intensity non-study Internet treatment was positively associated with @-day ppa at @ and @ months , and pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatment use was negatively associated with @-day ppa at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Non-assigned treatment use is an important factor to consider when evaluating Internet cessation interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Results highlight methodological issues in selecting a comparison condition .
CONCLUSIONS	Researchers should report non-assigned treatment use alongside main trial outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Reducing consumption of food away from home is often targeted during pediatric obesity treatment , given the associations with weight status and gain .
BACKGROUND	However , the effects of this dietary change on weight loss are unknown .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate associations between changes in dietary factors and child anthropometric outcomes after treatment .
OBJECTIVE	It is hypothesized that reduced consumption of food away from home will be associated with improved dietary intake and greater reductions in anthropometric outcomes ( standardized body mass index -LSB- BMI -RSB- and percent body fat ) , and the relationship between food away from home and anthropometric outcomes will be mediated by improved child dietary intake .
METHODS	We conducted a longitudinal evaluation of associations between dietary changes and child anthropometric outcomes .
METHODS	Child diet ( three @-hour recalls ) and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and @ weeks .
METHODS	Participants were @ overweight and obese children ages @ to @ years who completed a @-week family-based behavioral weight-loss treatment as part of a larger multi-site randomized controlled trial conducted in two cohorts between @ and @ ( clinical research trial ) .
METHODS	Dietary treatment targets during family-based behavioral weight-loss treatment included improving diet quality and reducing food away from home .
METHODS	The main outcome measures in this study were child relative weight ( standardized BMI ) and body composition ( percent body fat ) .
METHODS	We performed t tests and bootstrapped single-mediation analyses adjusting for relevant covariates .
RESULTS	As hypothesized , decreased food away from home was associated with improved diet quality and greater reductions in standardized BMI ( P < @ ) and percent body fat ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Associations between food away from home and anthropometric outcomes were mediated by changes in diet quality .
RESULTS	Specifically , change in total energy intake and added sugars mediated the association between change in food away from home and standardized BMI , and change in overall diet quality , fiber , added sugars , and added fats mediated the association between change in food away from home and percent body fat .
RESULTS	Including physical activity as a covariate did not significantly impact these findings .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that reducing food away from home can be an important behavioral target for affecting positive changes in both diet quality and anthropometric outcomes during treatment .

BACKGROUND	Long chain omega-@ polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LC n-@ PUFA ) such as EPA and DHA have been shown to possess beneficial health effects , and it is believed that many of their effects are mediated by their oxygenated products ( oxylipins ) .
BACKGROUND	Recently , we have shown that serum levels of several hydroxy , epoxy , and dihydroxy FAs are dependent on the individual status of the parent FAs in a cohort of normo - and hyperlipidemic subjects .
BACKGROUND	So far , the effect of an increased dietary LC n-@ PUFA intake on hydroxy , epoxy , and dihydroxy FA levels has not been investigated in subjects with mild combined hyperlipidemia .
METHODS	In the present study , we compared oxylipin patterns of @ hyperlipidemic ( cholesterol > @mg/dl ; triglyceride > @mg/ml ) and @ normolipidemic men in response to twelve weeks of LC n-@ PUFA intake ( @ g DHA and @ g EPA ) .
METHODS	Levels of @ free hydroxy , epoxy and dihydroxy FAs were analyzed in serum by LC-MS .
METHODS	Additionally , oxylipin levels were compared with their parent PUFA levels in erythrocyte membranes ; a biomarker for the individual PUFA status .
RESULTS	Differences in the oxylipin pattern between normo - and hyperlipidemic subjects were minor before and after treatment .
RESULTS	In all subjects , levels of EPA-derived oxylipins ( @-@pM ) were considerably elevated after LC n-@ PUFA intake ( @-@ % ) , the increase of DHA-derived oxylipins ( @-@pM ) was less pronounced ( @-@ % ) .
RESULTS	The relative change of EPA in erythrocyte membranes is strongly correlated ( r@ @ ; p < @ ) with the relative change of corresponding epoxy and dihydroxy FA serum levels .
RESULTS	The effect on arachidonic acid ( AA ) - derived oxylipin levels ( @-@ ,@ pM ) was inconsistent .
CONCLUSIONS	The dietary LC PUFA composition has a direct influence on the endogenous oxylipin profile , including several highly biological active EPA - and DHA-derived lipid mediators .
CONCLUSIONS	The shift in oxylipin pattern appears to be dependent on the initial LC PUFA status particularly for EPA .
CONCLUSIONS	The finding that also levels of other oxylipins derived from ALA , LA or AA are modified by LC n-@ PUFA intake might suggest that at least some of the effects of EPA and DHA could be mediated by a shift in the entire oxylipin profile .

OBJECTIVE	A small subset of HIV-positive adults have low HIV RNA in the absence of therapy , sometimes for years .
OBJECTIVE	Clinical factors associated with low HIV RNA in early infection have not been well defined .
METHODS	We assessed factors associated with low plasma HIV RNA level at study entry in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment ( START ) trial .
METHODS	All START participants had a baseline HIV RNA assessment within @ days prior to randomization .
METHODS	The key covariables considered for this analysis were race , and hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) status .
METHODS	We assessed factors associated with HIV RNA @ and @ HIV-@ RNA copies/mL using logistic regression .
METHODS	Because of the strong association between region of randomization and baseline low HIV RNA , analyses were stratified by region .
RESULTS	We found that , of @ eligible participants randomized in START with a baseline HIV RNA assessment , @ ( @ % ) had HIV RNA @copies/mL at baseline , and a further @ ( @ % ) between @ and @copies/mL .
RESULTS	We found that HIV exposure routes other than male homosexual contact , higher high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol levels , higher CD@ cell counts , and higher CD@ : CD@ ratio were associated with increased odds of low HIV RNA .
RESULTS	HCV antibody positivity was borderline statistically significantly associated with low HIV RNA .
RESULTS	Race and HBV surface antigen positivity were not significantly associated with low HIV RNA .
CONCLUSIONS	In a modern cohort of individuals with early untreated HIV infection , we found that HIV exposure routes other than male homosexual contact and higher HDL cholesterol were associated with increased odds of low HIV RNA .

RESULTS	Despite equivalent improvement in FEV@ after bronchodilator , the DH - group showed higher IC ( bronchodilator-placebo ) at rest in relation to the DH + group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , this was not found in relation to IC at peak exercise between DH + and DH - groups ( @ @ L vs. @ @ L , p > @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , both groups showed similar improvements in Tlim after bronchodilator ( median -LSB- interquartile range -RSB- : @ % -LSB- @-@ % -RSB- vs. @ % -LSB- @-@ % -RSB- ; p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Improvement in TLim was associated with an increase in IC at rest after bronchodilator in HD - patients with COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	However , even without that improvement , COPD patients can present with greater exercise tolerance after bronchodilator provided that they develop DH during exercise .

BACKGROUND	Acute otitis media ( AOM ) is a common childhood illness and the leading indication for antibiotic prescriptions for US children .
BACKGROUND	Xylitol , a naturally occurring sugar alcohol , can reduce AOM when given @ times per day as a gum or syrup , but a more convenient dosing regimen is needed for widespread adoption .
METHODS	We designed a pragmatic practice-based randomized controlled trial to determine if viscous xylitol solution at a dose of @ g @ times per day could reduce the occurrence of clinically diagnosed AOM among otitis-prone children @ months through @ years of age .
RESULTS	A total of @ subjects were enrolled , with @ allocated to xylitol and @ to placebo .
RESULTS	In the primary analysis of time to first clinically diagnosed AOM episode , the hazard ratio for xylitol versus placebo recipients was @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	In secondary analyses , the incidence of AOM was @ episodes per @ days in the xylitol group versus @ in the placebo group ( difference @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) ; total antibiotic use was @ days per @ days in the xylitol group versus @ in the placebo group ( difference @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The lack of effectiveness was not explained by nonadherence to treatment , as the hazard ratio for those taking nearly all assigned xylitol compared with those taking none was @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Viscous xylitol solution in a dose of @ g @ times per day was ineffective in reducing clinically diagnosed AOM among otitis-prone children .

OBJECTIVE	To compare visual outcome , higher-order aberrations , and corneal asphericity ( Q value ) between wavefront-guided and aspheric LASIK for myopia and myopic astigmatism .
METHODS	Forty patients were randomly selected to receive wavefront-guided LASIK ( wavefront-guided group ) or aspheric LASIK ( aspheric group ) ( @ eyes of @ patients in each group ) using the Technolas @z excimer laser platform ( Bausch & Lomb , Rochester , NY ) .
METHODS	Flaps were created using the Zyoptix XP microkeratome ( Bausch & Lomb ) .
METHODS	Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA ) , corneal topography , wavefront aberrometry , and contrast sensitivity .
METHODS	Minimum follow-up period was @ months .
RESULTS	At @ months postoperatively , the aspheric group had significantly better UDVA ( logMAR @ @ -LSB- Snellen @/@ -RSB- -LSB- range : -@ to @ -RSB- ) and lower mean residual spherical error ( +@ @ diopters -LSB- D -RSB- -LSB- range : -@ to @ D -RSB- ) than the wavefront-guided group ( logMAR UDVA @ @ -LSB- range : -@ to @ -RSB- ; MRSE -@ @ D -LSB- range : -@ to @ D -RSB- ) ( P = @ and < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Mean change in higher-order aberration root mean square at @ months postoperatively ( @-mm pupil ) was @ @ m after aspheric LASIK and @ @ m after wavefront-guided LASIK ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Aspheric LASIK induced minimal change in spherical aberrations postoperatively ( @ @ m , P = @ ) , unlike wavefront-guided LASIK ( @ @ m , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Change in Q value was significantly less in the aspheric group ( @ @ ) than the wavefront-guided group ( @ @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The aspheric group had significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies ( P < @ ) , whereas the wavefront-guided group showed a slight decrease at higher spatial frequency ( @ cycles per degree ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Aspheric LASIK induced significantly less change in higher-order aberrations and maintained corneal asphericity better than wavefront-guided LASIK .
CONCLUSIONS	The visual outcome and contrast sensitivity was better in the aspheric group at @ months postoperatively .

BACKGROUND	Hyperparathyroidism occurs frequently in X-linked hypophosphatemia ( XLH ) and may exacerbate phosphaturia , potentially affecting skeletal abnormalities .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to suppress elevated PTH levels in XLH patients .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , @-year trial of paricalcitol , with outcomes measured at entry and @ year later .
METHODS	PATIENTS were recruited from the investigators ' clinics or referred from throughout the United States .
METHODS	Data were collected in an in-patient hospital research unit .
METHODS	Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of XLH and hyperparathyroidism were offered participation and were eligible if they were @ years old or older and not pregnant , and their serum calcium level was less than @ mg/dL , their @-hydroxyvitamin D level was @ ng/mL or greater , and their creatinine level was @ mg/dL or less .
METHODS	The intervention for this study was the use of paricalcitol or placebo for @ year .
METHODS	Determined prior to trial onset was the change in PTH area under the curve .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included renal phosphate threshold per glomerular filtration rate , serum phosphorus , serum alkaline phosphatase activity , and ( @m ) Tc-methylenediphosphonate bone scans .
RESULTS	PTH area under the curve decreased @ % with paricalcitol , differing ( P = @ ) from the @ % increase with placebo .
RESULTS	The renal phosphate threshold per glomerular filtration rate increased @ % with paricalcitol and decreased @ % with placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum phosphorus increased @ % with paricalcitol but did not differ from placebo .
RESULTS	Paricalcitol decreased alkaline phosphatase activity in adults by @ % ( no change with placebo , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Bone scans improved in @ of @ paricalcitol subjects , whereas no placebo-treated subject improved .
RESULTS	Hypercalciuria developed in six paricalcitol subjects and persisted from baseline in one placebo subject .
CONCLUSIONS	Suppression of PTH may be a useful strategy for skeletal improvement in XLH patients with hyperparathyroidism , and paricalcitol appears to be an effective adjunct to standard therapy in this setting .
CONCLUSIONS	Although paricalcitol was well tolerated , urinary calcium and serum calcium and creatinine should be monitored closely with its use .

BACKGROUND	Whether the type of dietary fat could alter cardiometabolic responses to a hypercaloric diet is unknown .
BACKGROUND	In addition , subclinical cardiometabolic consequences of moderate weight gain require further study .
RESULTS	In a @-week , double-blind , parallel-group , randomized controlled trial , @ healthy , lean individuals ( mean age of @ ) consumed muffins ( @ % of energy -LSB- % E -RSB- from fat and @ % E refined carbohydrates ) providing @ kcal/day added to their habitual diets .
RESULTS	All muffins had identical contents , except for type of fat ; sunflower oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA diet ) or palm oil rich in saturated fatty acids ( SFA diet ) .
RESULTS	Despite comparable weight gain in the @ groups , total : high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein : HDL cholesterol , and apolipoprotein B : AI ratios decreased during the PUFA versus the SFA diet ( -@ versus +@ , -@ versus +@ , and -@ versus +@ , P = @ , P = @ , and P = @ for between-group differences ) , whereas no significant differences were observed for other cardiometabolic risk markers .
RESULTS	In the whole group ( ie , independently of fat type ) , body weight increased ( +@ % , P < @ ) together with increased plasma proinsulin ( +@ % , P = @ ) , insulin ( +@ % , P = @ ) , proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type @ , ( +@ % , P = @ ) fibroblast growth factor-@ ( +@ % , P = @ ) , endothelial markers vascular cell adhesion molecule-@ , intercellular adhesion molecule-@ , and E-selectin ( +@ , +@ , and +@ % , respectively , P < @ for all ) , whereas nonesterified fatty acids decreased ( -@ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Excess energy from PUFA versus SFA reduces atherogenic lipoproteins .
CONCLUSIONS	Modest weight gain in young individuals induces hyperproinsulinemia and increases biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction , effects that may be partly outweighed by the lipid-lowering effects of PUFA .

OBJECTIVE	To characterize the variability in exposure and metabolic effect of insulin glargine @U/ml ( Gla-@ ) at steady state in people with type @ diabetes ( T@DM ) .
METHODS	A total of @ participants with T@DM underwent two @-h euglycaemic clamps in steady-state conditions after six once-daily administrations of @ U/kg Gla-@ in a double-blind , randomized , two-treatment , two-period , crossover clamp study .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to receive Gla-@ as a standard cartridge formulation in the first treatment period , and as a formulation with enhanced stability through polysorbate-@ addition in the second treatment period , or vice versa .
METHODS	This design allowed the assessment of bioequivalence between formulations and , subsequently , within - and between-day variability .
RESULTS	The cumulative exposure and effect of Gla-@ developed linearly over @h , and were evenly distributed across @ - and @-h intervals .
RESULTS	Diurnal fluctuation in exposure ( within-day variability ) was low ; the peak-to-trough ratio of insulin concentration profiles was < @ , and both the swing and peak-to-trough fluctuation were < @ .
RESULTS	Day-to-day reproducibility of exposure was high : the between-day within-subject coefficients of variation for total systemic exposure ( area under the serum insulin glargine concentration time curve from time @ to @h after dosing ) and maximum insulin concentration were @ % -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ -RSB- and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Reproducibility of the metabolic effect was lower than that of exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	Gla-@ provides predictable , evenly distributed @-h coverage as a result of low fluctuation and high reproducibility in insulin exposure , and appears suitable for effective basal insulin use .

OBJECTIVE	Echocardiography-guided ( EG ) lead placement at the site of latest left ventricular ( LV ) mechanical activation improves outcome in patients receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) defibrillator ( D ) .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to examine whether a strategy of EG LV lead placement equally improves outcome in CRT recipients with wide ( @ ms ) versus intermediate ( @-@ ms ) QRS duration .
METHODS	Patients treated with a CRT-D in the Speckle Tracking Assisted Resynchronization Therapy for Electrode Region ( STARTER ) prospective , randomized trial ( @ EG strategy and @ routine strategy ) were followed to the endpoint of death or first appropriate CRT-D therapy .
METHODS	Of the patients enrolled in STARTER , @ had QRS@ ms and @ had @ < QRS@ ms.
RESULTS	Over a mean follow-up period of @ years , @ ( @ % ) patients died and @ ( @ % ) received appropriate CRT-D therapy .
RESULTS	Compared to patients with QRS@ ms , patients with intermediate QRS had meaningfully worse survival free from ICD therapy ( HR = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	CRT-D therapy-free survival was significantly worse in patients with intermediate QRS duration randomized to the routine LV lead placement strategy , compared to patients with intermediate QRS duration randomized to the EG LV lead placement strategy or patients with wide QRS duration regardless of LV implantation strategy ( HR = @ , @ % confidence interval = @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This finding was independent in type of cardiomyopathy .
CONCLUSIONS	A strategy of EG LV lead placement improves survival free from defibrillator therapy in patients with QRS between @-@ ms to levels comparable to those of patients with QRS@ ms.

BACKGROUND	After traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , catecholamines ( CAs ) may be needed to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) , but there are no recommended alternative vasopressor therapies .
BACKGROUND	This is an interim report of the first study to test the hypothesis that arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) is a safe and effective alternative to CAs for the management of CPP in patients with severe TBI .
METHODS	Since @ , all TBI patients requiring intracranial pressure monitoring at this Level @ trauma center have been eligible for a randomized trial to receive either CA or AVP if vasopressors were required to maintain CPP greater than @ mm Hg .
RESULTS	To date , @ patients have been consented and randomized .
RESULTS	Demographics , vital signs , and laboratory values were similar .
RESULTS	As treated , @ required no vasopressors and were the least severely injured group with the best outcomes .
RESULTS	Twenty-three patients received CA ( @ % levophed , @ % dopamine , @ % phenylephrine ) and @ patients received AVP .
RESULTS	The two vasopressor groups had similar demographics , but Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) and fluid requirements on intensive care unit Day @ were worse in the AVP versus the CA groups ( all p < @ ) before treatment .
RESULTS	These differences indicate more severe injury with accompanying hemodynamic instability .
RESULTS	Nevertheless , adverse events were not increased with AVP versus CA .
RESULTS	Trends favored AVP versus CA , but no apparent differences were statistically significant at this interim point .
RESULTS	There was no difference in mortality rates between CA and AVP .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary results suggest that AVP is a safe and effective alternative to CA for the management of CPP after TBI and support the continued investigation and use of AVP when vasopressors are required for CPP management in TBI patients .
METHODS	Therapeutic study , level II .

BACKGROUND	Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) is widely recommended as first-line therapy for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide .
BACKGROUND	Artemisinin resistance has now been reported in Southeast Asia with a clinical phenotype manifested by slow parasite clearance .
BACKGROUND	Although there are no reliable reports of artemisinin resistance in Africa , there is a need to better understand the dynamics of parasite clearance in African children treated with ACT in order to better detect the emergence of artemisinin resistance .
METHODS	Data from a cohort of Ugandan children four to five years old , enrolled in a longitudinal , randomized , clinical trial comparing two leading ACT , artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) , were analysed .
METHODS	For all episodes of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria over a @-month period , daily blood smears were performed for three days following the initiation of therapy .
METHODS	Associations between pre-treatment variables of interest and persistent parasitaemia were estimated using multivariate , generalized , estimating equations with adjustment for repeated measures in the same patient .
RESULTS	A total of @ children were included , resulting in @ episodes of malaria treated with AL and @ episodes treated with DP .
RESULTS	The prevalence of parasitaemia on days @ , @ , and @ following initiation of therapy was @ , @ and @ % in those treated with AL , and @ , @ and @ % in those treated with DP .
RESULTS	Independent risk factors for persistent parasitaemia on day @ included treatment with AL vs DP ( RR = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p < @ ) , having a temperature @ C vs < @ C ( RR = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) and having a parasite density > @,@ / L vs < @,@ / L ( RR = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Independent risk factors for having persistent parasitaemia on day @ included elevated temperature , higher parasite density , and being HIV infected .
CONCLUSIONS	Among Ugandan children , parasite clearance following treatment with AL or DP was excellent with only one of @ patients tested having a positive blood slide three days after initiation of therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	The type of ACT given , pre-treatment temperature , pre-treatment parasite density and HIV status were associated with differences in persistent parasitaemia , one or two days following therapy .

BACKGROUND	Understanding the nature and time course of the pharmacodynamic effects of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) medications is useful .
BACKGROUND	The Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Battery of Tests ( CDR-CBT ) is a @-min battery of ten standardized , validated neuropsychometric tasks .
OBJECTIVE	This pilot study examined the sensitivity and responsiveness of the CDR-CBT for assessing cognitive function in adults with ADHD prior to and up to @ h postdose during treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate ( LDX ) or mixed amphetamine salts immediate release ( MAS-IR ; various generics available ) .
METHODS	This was a double-blind three-period crossover study .
METHODS	Participants received LDX @ mg/day , MAS-IR @ mg/day , and placebo ( ~ @ a.m. ) for @ days each in randomized order .
METHODS	CDR-CBT was administered on day @ of period @ and day @ of each period at scheduled times between -@ ( predose ) and @ h postdose .
METHODS	Composite power of attention ( PoA ) score ( sum of simple reaction time , choice reaction time , and digit vigilance speed ) was the primary outcome measure .
METHODS	The Conners ' Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Self-Report : Short Version ( CAARS-S : S ) was administered at baseline and on day @ of period @ , and days @ and @ of each treatment period .
METHODS	Tertiary outcomes included CDR-CBT composite continuity of attention scores , its component task scores , cognitive reaction time , and response variability scores .
METHODS	No inferential statistical comparisons were conducted .
METHODS	Safety assessments included adverse events ( AEs ) and vital signs .
RESULTS	This analysis included @ participants ( mean age @ years ) ; one withdrew because of AEs .
RESULTS	Mean pretreatment PoA scores were @-@ @ ms , scores commensurate with a normative age of > @ years .
RESULTS	Maximum reductions in PoA scores with LDX and MAS-IR occurred at @ h postdose at day @ ( least squares mean difference -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- of -@ -LSB- -@ to -@ -RSB- and -@ -LSB- -@ to @ -RSB- ms vs. placebo , respectively ) .
RESULTS	CAARS-S : S scores were unchanged with LDX and MAS-IR ( vs. placebo ) at all postdose timepoints .
RESULTS	Tertiary attention-related CDR-CBT outcomes were sensitive to LDX and MAS-IR ( vs. placebo ) .
RESULTS	Treatment-emergent AEs and vital signs were consistent with previous studies in adult ADHD .
CONCLUSIONS	In adults with ADHD , PoA scores indicated impaired attention at baseline and response to treatment with LDX and MAS-IR ( vs. placebo ) , demonstrating value for measuring the time course of pharmacologic treatment effects .

BACKGROUND	Several studies have presented evidence suggesting that dairy consumption has beneficial effects on blood pressure ( BP ) in healthy subjects ; however , only a few studies have examined this possibility in patients with established essential hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to investigate how consuming dairy products impacts mean daytime systolic and diastolic BP in men and women with mild to moderate essential hypertension .
METHODS	Eighty-nine men and women with systolic BP@mm Hg and@mm Hg and diastolic BP@mm Hg were enrolled in this single-blind , randomized , cross-over , controlled study .
METHODS	Participants had to incorporate three daily servings of dairy products or control products equivalent in macronutrients and sodium during four-week treatment phases .
METHODS	Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP and endothelial function were assessed at screening and at the end of each dietary phase .
RESULTS	The consumption of three daily servings of dairy products led to a significant reduction in mean daytime ambulatory systolic BP ( -@ mm Hg ; P = @ ) in men compared with readings after the control phase .
RESULTS	In women , dairy consumption had no effect on ambulatory systolic BP .
RESULTS	Moreover , endothelial function was significantly improved by dairy consumption in the whole cohort .
CONCLUSIONS	These data indicate that the consumption of three daily servings of dairy products have beneficial effects on daytime systolic ambulatory BP compared to a heart-healthy , dairy-free , diet in men with mild to moderate essential hypertension .

OBJECTIVE	The Age-Related Eye Disease Study @ ( AREDS @ ) has shown that nutritional supplementation with antioxidants and zinc modifies the natural course of AMD .
OBJECTIVE	It is presumed that the supplements exert their beneficial effects by ameliorating oxidative stress due to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
OBJECTIVE	We have shown in a human model that under oxidative stress induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) the vasoconstrictor response of retinal vessels to oxygen breathing is diminished .
OBJECTIVE	This reduced vascular response to hyperoxia was previously shown to be normalized by the AREDS @ supplements .
OBJECTIVE	In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that the response can also be restored by a different antioxidant formulation .
METHODS	This randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled parallel group study included @ healthy volunteers .
METHODS	On each study day , retinal red blood cell ( RBC ) flow and the reactivity of retinal RBC flow to hyperoxia were investigated in the absence and presence of @ ng/kg LPS .
METHODS	Between the two study days , subjects received either the supplement or placebo for @ days .
RESULTS	Before supplementation LPS reduced retinal arterial vasoconstriction ( P < @ ) and reactivity of retinal RBC flow ( P = @ ) in response to @ % oxygen breathing .
RESULTS	Two weeks of supplementation did not affect baseline retinal RBC flow , but normalized the LPS-induced change in the response to hyperoxia .
RESULTS	The arterial vasoconstrictor response during LPS and @ % oxygen breathing was @ @ % after administration of placebo and @ @ % after supplementation ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The response of RBC flow to @ % oxygen breathing during LPS was @ @ % after administration of placebo and @ @ % after supplementation ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data show that the supplement used in the present study can normalize the response of retinal RBC flow to hyperoxia under LPS administration .
CONCLUSIONS	This indicates that supplementation can prevent endothelial dysfunction induced by oxidative stress , which is assumed to play a role in the pathophysiology of AMD .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this clinical study was to identify changes in pulpal blood flow ( PBF ) in human central incisors resulting from short - and long-term intrusive orthodontic forces from mini-implants .
METHODS	A total of @ sound upper central and lateral incisors in @ patients scheduled for intrusion for orthodontic reasons were divided into two groups .
METHODS	From each group , @ teeth were subjected to intrusive force from mini-implants ( Group @ = Light Force : @ g ; Group @ = Heavy Force : @ g ) , whereas the remaining @ contralateral teeth were not subjected to forces from mini-implants and served as controls .
METHODS	Laser-Doppler flowmetry ( LDF ) measurements were recorded at baseline and at @ days and @ weeks following intrusion .
RESULTS	PBF decreased significantly at @ days ( Light Force Group : @ @ ; Heavy Force Group : @ @ ) and then increased towards baseline at @ weeks ( Light Force Group : @ @ ; Heavy Force Group : @ @ ) following intrusion .
CONCLUSIONS	In other words , despite slight regressive changes in pulpal tissue in the short-term , PBF improved after @ weeks following intrusion by mini-implants , indicating that the changes observed in PBF is reversible , even following radical incisor intrusion .

BACKGROUND	Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be predictive of low birthweight , prematurity , and postpartum depression .
BACKGROUND	These adverse outcomes potentially have lasting effects on maternal and child well-being .
BACKGROUND	Socio-economically disadvantaged women are twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for antenatal major depression ( MDD ) , but have proven difficult to engage and retain in treatment .
BACKGROUND	Collaborative care treatment models for depression have not been evaluated for racially/ethnically diverse , pregnant women on Medicaid receiving care in a public health system .
BACKGROUND	This paper describes the design , methodology , culturally relevant enhancements , and implementation of a randomized controlled trial of depression care management compared to public health Maternity Support Services ( MSS ) .
METHODS	Pregnant , public health patients , > @ years with a likely diagnosis of MDD or dysthymia , measured respectively by the Patient Health Questionnaire-@ ( PHQ-@ ) or the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) , were randomized to the intervention or to public health MSS .
METHODS	The primary outcome was reduction in depression severity from baseline during pregnancy to @-months post-baseline ( one-year postpartum ) .
RESULTS	@ women with likely MDD ( @ % ) and/or dysthymia ( @ % ) were randomized .
RESULTS	Average age was @ years and gestational age was @ weeks ; @ % racial/ethnic minority ; @ % unmarried ; @ % no high school degree/GED ; @ % unemployed ; @ % making < $ @,@ annually ; @ % having recurrent depression ; @ % PTSD , and @ % unplanned pregnancy .
CONCLUSIONS	A collaborative care team , including a psychiatrist , psychologist , project manager , and @ social workers , met weekly , collaborated with the patients ' obstetrics providers , and monitored depression severity using an electronic tracking system .
CONCLUSIONS	Potential sustainability of the intervention within a public health system requires further study .

BACKGROUND	ICU-acquired weakness ( ICU-AW ) has immediate and long-term consequences for critically ill patients .
BACKGROUND	Strategies for the prevention of weakness include modification of known risk factors , such as hyperglycemia and immobility .
BACKGROUND	Intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) has been proposed to prevent critical illness polyneuropathy .
BACKGROUND	However , the effect of insulin and early mobilization on clinically apparent weakness is not well known .
METHODS	This is a secondary analysis of all patients with mechanical ventilation ( N = @ ) previously enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of early occupational and physical therapy vs conventional therapy , which evaluated the end point of functional independence .
METHODS	Every patient had IIT and blinded muscle strength testing on hospital discharge to determine the incidence of clinically apparent weakness .
METHODS	The effects of insulin dose and early mobilization on the incidence of ICU-AW were assessed .
RESULTS	On logistic regression analyses , early mobilization and increasing insulin dose prevented the incidence of ICU-AW ( OR , @ , P = @ ; OR , @ , P = @ ; respectively ) independent of known risk factors for weakness .
RESULTS	Early mobilization also significantly reduced insulin requirements to achieve similar glycemic goals as compared with control patients ( @ units/kg/d vs @ units/kg/d , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The duel effect of early mobilization in reducing clinically relevant ICU-AW and promoting euglycemia suggests its potential usefulness as an alternative to IIT .

BACKGROUND	Tailoring the content and tone of IHCAs to the needs of individual patients might improve their effectiveness .
OBJECTIVE	The main objective was to test the effectiveness of a Web-based , tailored , fully automated IHCA for patients with type @ diabetes or chronic low back pain against a standard website with identical content without tailoring ( control condition ) on patients ' knowledge and empowerment .
METHODS	We performed a blinded randomized trial with a parallel design .
METHODS	In the intervention group , the content was delivered in dialogue form , tailored to relevant patient characteristics .
METHODS	In the control group , the sections of the text were presented in a content tree without any tailoring .
METHODS	Participants were recruited online and offline and were blinded to their group assignments .
METHODS	Measurements were taken at baseline ( t@ ) , directly after the first visit ( t@ ) , and at @-month follow-up ( t@ ) .
METHODS	The primary hypothesis was that the tailored IHCA would have larger effects on knowledge and patient empowerment ( primary outcomes ) than the control website .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes were decisional conflict and preparation for decision making .
METHODS	All measurements were conducted by online self-report questionnaires .
METHODS	Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and available cases ( AC ) analyses were performed for all outcomes .
RESULTS	A total of @ users agreed to participate in the study .
RESULTS	Of these , @ ( @ % ) had type @ diabetes and @ ( @ % ) had chronic low back pain .
RESULTS	Usage was significantly higher in the tailored system ( mean @ minutes ) than in the control system ( mean @ minutes ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Three months after system use , @ % of the sample was retained .
RESULTS	There was no significant intervention effect in the ITT analysis .
RESULTS	In the AC analysis , participants using the tailored system displayed significantly more knowledge at t@ ( P = @ ) and more emotional well-being ( subscale of empowerment ) at t@ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The estimated mean difference between the groups was @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) points for knowledge and @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) points for emotional well-being on a @-@ points scale .
CONCLUSIONS	The primary analysis did not support the study hypothesis .
CONCLUSIONS	However , content tailoring and interactivity may increase knowledge and reduce health-related negative effects in persons who use IHCAs .
CONCLUSIONS	There were no main effects of the intervention on other dimensions of patient empowerment or decision-related outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	This might be due to our tailored IHCA being , at its core , an educational intervention offering health information in a personalized , empathic fashion that merely additionally provides decision support .
CONCLUSIONS	Tailoring and interactivity may not make a difference with regard to these outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	In this study , we tested the hypothesis that pulmonary artery venting would decrease the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery .
METHODS	This prospective study included @ patients who underwent complete myocardial revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass in our department during a @-year period .
METHODS	The patients were randomly divided into @ groups : group I included @ patients who underwent aortic root venting and group II included @ patients who underwent pulmonary arterial venting for decompression of the left heart .
METHODS	Pre - , peri - , and postoperative risk factors for atrial fibrillation were assessed in both groups .
RESULTS	The mean age was similar in the @ groups .
RESULTS	The mean number of anastomoses was significantly higher in group I ( @ @ ) than in group II ( @ @ ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean cross-clamp time was @ @ minutes in group I and @ @ minutes in group II ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was @ @ minutes in group I and @ @ minutes in group II ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of atrial fibrillation was @ % ( n = @ ) in group I and @ % ( n = @ ) in group II ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate regression analysis showed that pulmonary artery venting decreased the postoperative incidence of atrial fibrillation by @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Pulmonary arterial venting may be used as an alternative to aortic root venting during on-pump coronary bypass surgery , especially in patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation .

OBJECTIVE	Biapenem is a newly developed carbapenem to treat moderate and severe bacterial infections .
OBJECTIVE	This multicenter , randomized , parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy , bacterial eradication rates and safety of biapenem and meropenem in the treatment of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) at nine centres in China .
METHODS	Patients diagnosed with bacterial lower respiratory tract infections or UTIs were randomly assigned to receive either biapenem ( @ mg every @ h ) or meropenem ( @ mg every @ h ) by intravenous infusion for @ to @ days according to their disease severity .
METHODS	The overall clinical efficacy , bacterial eradication rates and drug-related adverse reactions of biapenem and meropenem were analyzed .
RESULTS	A total of @ enrolled cases were included in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis and safety analysis .
RESULTS	There were no differences in demographics and baseline medical characteristics between biapenem group and meropenem group .
RESULTS	The overall clinical efficacies of biapenem and meropenem were not significantly different , @ per cent ( @/@ ) vs. @ per cent ( @/@ ) .
RESULTS	The overall bacterial eradication rates of biapenem and meropenem showed no significant difference , @ per cent ( @/@ ) vs. @ per cent ( @/@ ) .
RESULTS	Drug-related adverse reactions were comparable in biapenem and meropenem groups with the incidence of @ per cent ( @/@ ) and @ per cent ( @/@ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The most common symptoms of biapenem-related adverse reactions were rash ( @ % ) and gastrointestinal distress ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Biapenem was non-inferior to meropenem and was well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate and severe lower respiratory tract infections and UTIs .

BACKGROUND	Early negative postoperative behavior ( e-PONB ) is common in children and manifests itself as emergence agitation ( EA ) , emergence delirium ( ED ) , and pain .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this prospective double blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was to determine whether IV clonidine or IV fentanyl prior to surgery modifies e-PONB in children .
METHODS	Ninety children scheduled for subumbilical surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia supplemented with regional anesthesia were randomized to either receive IV clonidine @mcgkg ( -@ ) , IV fentanyl @mcgkg ( -@ ) or placebo ( IV saline ) before surgery .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures were the incidence of EA , ED and pain during the first hour after awakening .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures were side effects such as nausea and vomiting and delayed discharge from PACU .
RESULTS	Eighty-seven children ( n = @ per group ) completed the study .
RESULTS	EA was present in @ children ( six clonidine , none fentanyl , and four placebo , P = @ ) whereas ED was observed in @ children ( nine clonidine , three fentanyl , and eight placebo P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Sixteen children who received placebo had a CHIPPS score of @ compared with nine children in fentanyl group and @ children receiving clonidine ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ten children receiving fentanyl vomited during the first postoperative day , compared with six children in placebo group and none in clonidine group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Discharge from PACU was not affected .
CONCLUSIONS	IV fentanyl before surgery but not IV clonidine modifies e-PONB in children undergoing lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia supplemented with regional anesthesia .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of fentanyl in this population was also associated with reduced pain scores after awakening but with significantly greater incidence of PONV .

BACKGROUND	Although pain is a common complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , management strategies are inadequate .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical bupivacaine and triamcinolone acetonide for abdominal pain relief and as a potential method of pain control after ESD for gastric neoplasia .
METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , @ eligible patients with early gastric neoplasm were randomized into one of three groups : bupivacaine ( BV ) only , bupivacaine with triamcinolone ( BV-TA ) , or placebo .
METHODS	The present pain intensity ( PPI ) score and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( SF-MPQ ) were used to evaluate pain at @ , @ , @ , and @ h after ESD .
RESULTS	The mean values for the @-hour PPI in the BV-TA and BV groups were lower than those of the placebo group ( @ @ and @ @ vs. @ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-hour PPI of the BV-TA group ( @ @ ) was the lowest among the three groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The total @-hour SF-MPQ score , especially in the sensory domain , was higher in the placebo group than in BV and BV-TA groups .
RESULTS	The @-hour SF-MPQ score was the lowest in the BV-TA group .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BV-TA injection protocol , fibrosis , and size of residual ulcer were independently associated with the PPI score at @ h.
CONCLUSIONS	Bupivacaine after ESD was effective for pain relief at @ h postoperatively .
CONCLUSIONS	Particularly , topical infiltration of bupivacaine mixed with triamcinolone acetonide was helpful for producing a more long-lasting benefit of pain relief after gastric ESD .

OBJECTIVE	Physical activity is a cornerstone in therapy for patients with metabolic syndrome .
OBJECTIVE	Walking and hiking in a mountain scenery represents an ideal approach to make them move .
OBJECTIVE	The Austrian Moderate Altitude Study ( AMAS ) @ main study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the cardiovascular effects of hiking at moderate altitude on patients with metabolic syndrome compared with a control group at low altitude , to assess a potential altitude-specific effect .
METHODS	Seventy-one male patients with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a moderate altitude group ( at @ m ) , with @ participants , or to a low altitude group ( at @ m ) , with @ participants .
METHODS	The @-week vacation program included @ hiking tours ( @ per week , average duration @ hours , intensity @ % to @ % of heart rate maximum ) .
METHODS	Physical parameters , performance capacity , @-hour blood pressure , and heart rate profiles were obtained before , during , and after the stay .
RESULTS	In both groups , we found a significant mean weight loss of -@ kg ; changes in performance capacity were minor .
RESULTS	Systolic , diastolic , and mean arterial pressures and circadian heart rate profiles were significantly reduced in both groups , with no differences between them .
RESULTS	Consequently , the pressure-rate product was reduced as well .
RESULTS	All study participants tolerated the vacation well without any adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	A @-week hiking vacation at moderate or low altitude is safe for patients with metabolic syndrome and provides several improvements in their cardiovascular parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	The cardiovascular benefits achieved are more likely to be the result of regular physical activity than the altitude-specific effect of a mountain environment .

BACKGROUND	Isolated limb perfusion ( ILP ) is a treatment option most commonly used in the treatment of melanoma in-transit metastases of the extremities .
BACKGROUND	The principle idea is to surgically isolate a region of the body and then deliver a high concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent together with hyperthermia .
BACKGROUND	There have been three randomised trials exploring whether adjuvant ILP to patients with recurrent or high-risk primary melanomas increases survival ; one of these trials has now been updated with a @-year follow-up .
METHODS	The original study randomised @ patients ( between @ and @ ) with their first satellite or in-transit recurrence to either wide excision ( WE group , n = @ patients ) or to WE and adjuvant ILP ( WE+ILP group , n = @ patients ) .
METHODS	Follow-up data @ years later concerning survival and cause of death was retrieved from the Swedish National Cause of Death Register .
RESULTS	In the WE+ILP group there were @ deaths ( @ % ) due to melanoma compared with @ deaths ( @ % ) in the WE group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median melanoma-specific survival was @ months for WE+ILP compared to @ months for the WE group , an almost @ year benefit without statistical significance ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no evidence that adjuvant ILP prolongs survival in patients with high-risk or recurrent melanoma ; however , the existing randomised trials are largely underpowered to detect such a difference .
CONCLUSIONS	New studies are exploring systemic immunological effects of ILP , and a combination of regional therapy and immunotherapy may serve as a rationale for new trials using ILP in the future .

BACKGROUND	Automated health behavior change interventions show promise , but suffer from high attrition and disuse .
BACKGROUND	The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change , but an endless source of novel , entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists .
OBJECTIVE	Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet , the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior , in this case weight loss .
METHODS	An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques .
METHODS	The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset , then evaluated in a @ between-subjects randomized pilot study .
METHODS	One factor compared the effects of participants reading @ indexed stories vs @ randomly selected stories , whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories : text or animated conversational agent .
METHODS	Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read .
RESULTS	Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website ( N = @ ; @ % , @/@ female ; mean age @ , SD @ years ; @ % , @/@ precontemplation ; @ % , @/@ contemplation for weight loss ) .
RESULTS	Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) or decisional balance ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes , such as self-efficacy for changing behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort .

BACKGROUND	Many patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) routinely receive a combination of an inhaled bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroid , but those with severe disease often respond poorly to these classes of drug .
BACKGROUND	We assessed the efficacy and safety of a novel inhaled dual phosphodiesterase @ ( PDE@ ) and PDE@ inhibitor , RPL@ for its ability to act as a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory drug .
METHODS	Between February , @ , and January , @ , we undertook four proof-of-concept clinical trials in the Netherlands , Italy , and the UK .
METHODS	Nebulised RPL@ was examined in study @ for safety in @ healthy men who were randomly assigned ( @:@:@ ) to receive an inhaled dose of RPL@ ( @ mg/kg or @ mg/kg ) or placebo by a computer-generated randomisation table .
METHODS	Subsequently , six non-smoking men with mild allergic asthma received single doses of RPL@ ( three received @ mg/kg and three received @ mg/kg ) in an open-label , adaptive study , and then ten men with mild allergic asthma were randomly assigned to receive placebo or RPL@ ( @ mg/kg ) by a computer-generated randomisation table for an assessment of safety , bronchodilation , and bronchoprotection .
METHODS	Study @ examined the reproducibility of the bronchodilator response to a daily dose of nebulised RPL@ ( @ mg/kg ) for @ consecutive days in a single-blind ( patients masked ) , placebo-controlled study in @ men with clinically stable asthma .
METHODS	The safety and bronchodilator effect of RPL@ ( @ mg/kg ) was assessed in study @ , an open-label , placebo-controlled crossover trial , in @ men with mild-to-moderate COPD .
METHODS	In study @ , a placebo-controlled crossover trial , the effect of RPL@ ( @ mg/kg ) on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cell infiltration in induced sputum was investigated in @ healthy men .
METHODS	In studies @ and @ , randomisation was done by computer-generated permutation with a block size of two for study @ and four for study @ .
METHODS	Unless otherwise stated , participants and clinicians were masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	Analyses were by intention to treat .
METHODS	All trials were registered with EudraCT , numbers @-@-@ , @-@-@ , @-@-@ , and @-@-@ .
RESULTS	Safety was a primary endpoint of studies @ and @ and a secondary endpoint of studies @ and @ .
RESULTS	Overall , RPL@ was well tolerated , and adverse events were generally mild and of equal frequency between placebo and active treatment groups .
RESULTS	Efficacy was a primary endpoint of study @ and a secondary endpoint of studies @ and @ .
RESULTS	Study @ measured change in forced expiratory volume in @ s ( FEV@ ) and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a @ % fall in FEV@ ( PC@MCh ) in participants with asthma .
RESULTS	RPL@ produced rapid bronchodilation in patients with asthma with an FEV@ increase at @ h of @ mL ( @ % CI @-@ ; p < @ ) , which was a @ % increase from placebo , and increased the PC@MCh by @ doubling doses ( @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) compared with placebo .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint of study @ was maximum FEV@ reached during @ h after dosing with RPL@ in patients with asthma .
RESULTS	RPL@ produced a similar maximum mean increase in FEV@ from placebo on day @ ( @ mL , @ % CI @-@ ) , day @ ( @ mL , @-@ ) , and day @ ( @ mL , @-@ ; overall p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A secondary endpoint of study @ ( patients with COPD ) was the increase from baseline in FEV@ .
RESULTS	RPL@ produced bronchodilation with a mean maximum FEV@ increase of @ % ( SE @ ) .
RESULTS	In healthy individuals ( study @ ) , the primary endpoint was percentage change in neutrophil counts in induced sputum @ h after lipopolysaccharide challenge .
RESULTS	RPL@ ( @ mg/kg ) did not significantly reduce the percentage of neutrophils in sputum ( @ % in the RPL@ group vs @ % in the placebo group ; difference -@ % , @ % CI -@ to @ , p = @ ) , since RPL@ significantly reduced neutrophils ( p = @ ) and total cells ( p = @ ) to a similar degree .
CONCLUSIONS	In four exploratory studies , inhaled RPL@ is an effective and well tolerated bronchodilator , bronchoprotector , and anti-inflammatory drug and further studies will establish the full potential of this new drug for the treatment of patients with COPD or asthma .

OBJECTIVE	Intensified repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) may result in fast clinical responses in treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) .
OBJECTIVE	In these kinds of patients , subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ( sgACC ) functional connectivity ( FC ) seems to be consistently disturbed .
OBJECTIVE	So far , no de novo data on the relationship between sgACC FC changes and clinical efficacy of accelerated rTMS were available .
METHODS	Twenty unipolar TRD patients , all at least stage III treatment resistant , were recruited in a randomized sham-controlled crossover high-frequency ( HF ) - rTMS treatment study .
METHODS	Resting-state ( rs ) functional MRI scans were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment .
RESULTS	HF-rTMS responders showed significantly stronger resting-state functional connectivity ( rsFC ) anti-correlation between the sgACC and parts of the left superior medial prefrontal cortex .
RESULTS	After successful treatment an inverted relative strength of the anti-correlations was observed in the perigenual prefrontal cortex ( pgPFC ) .
RESULTS	No effects on sgACC rsFC were observed in non-responders .
CONCLUSIONS	Strong rsFC anti-correlation between the sgACC and parts of the left prefrontal cortex could be indicative of a beneficial outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Accelerated HF-rTMS treatment designs have the potential to acutely adjust deregulated sgACC neuronal networks in TRD patients .

BACKGROUND	Screening Tool of Older Person 's Prescriptions ( STOPP ) and the Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment ( START ) have been increasingly used to evaluate potentially inappropriate prescriptions ( PIPs ) and potentially prescription omissions ( PPOs ) .
BACKGROUND	The impact of hospitalization on PIPs/PPOs has not been investigated in depth .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the prevalence of PIPs/PPOs in elderly patients on hospital admission and discharge and to identify associated risk factors .
METHODS	An acute medical geriatric division of the Tel Aviv Medical Center ( Israel ) .
METHODS	This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients admitted from @/@ to @/@ aged @ years .
METHODS	Data from patients ' records included demographic details , diagnoses and medications at admission and discharge .
METHODS	STOPP/START criteria were applied to each patient 's record .
METHODS	Prevalence of PIPs/PPOs on hospital admission and discharge .
RESULTS	Three hundred patients were included ( mean SD age @ @ years ) .
RESULTS	Admission PIPs prevalence was @ % ( @ patients , @ PIPs ) and it increased to @ % ( @ patients , @ PIPs ) at discharge ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Admission PPOs prevalence was @ % ( @ patients , @ PPOs ) and it decreased to @ % ( @ patients , @ PPOs ) at discharge ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Having at least one PIP/PPO at discharge but not at admission was associated with length of hospital stay ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	History of falls increased the risk of being a `` new PIP patient '' ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , whereas diabetes increased the risk of being a `` new PPO patient '' ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Hospitalization in a geriatric division resulted in an increase in PIPs and a decrease in PPOs .
CONCLUSIONS	Strategies to reduce PIPs need to be implemented , especially for patients with longer hospital stay and a history of falls .

OBJECTIVE	Tadalafil is a potent and selective phosphodiesterase type @ inhibitor that provides effective treatment for erectile dysfunction ( ED ) .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of a single on-demand dose of tadalafil compared to low-dose continuous administration on regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) , in patients after stroke .
METHODS	Thirty consecutive male patients ( mean age @ @ years ) with ED and a history of stroke were included in the study .
METHODS	The baseline single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) study was performed @ min after iv injection of @ MBq Tc-@m-HMPAO ( Ceretec ; GE Healthcare Ltd. .
METHODS	Chalfont St. Giles , UK ) .
METHODS	Fifteen randomized patients received a single dose of @ mg tadalafil in the morning , and a second SPECT study was performed @ h later .
METHODS	Fifteen other patients received @ mg of tadalafil each morning for seven consecutive days , and the second SPECT study was performed @ h after the last dose .
METHODS	The imaging data were evaluated using SPM software ( Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology , University College , London ) .
RESULTS	Associations between any of the risk factors/comorbidities and the perfusion changes were not detected .
RESULTS	All patients showed areas of reduced relative rCBF in the affected hemisphere after tadalafil administration compared to baseline ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found between patients on @ mg tadalafil and @ mg dose .
CONCLUSIONS	Tadalafil administration after cerebral stroke may be associated with diminished blood flow to areas adjacent to the stroke .
CONCLUSIONS	The alterations in perfusion suggest a need for caution in prescribing tadalafil to patients with a history of stroke , especially with continuous administration that may impose constant stress on the cerebral circulation .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the short-term effect of a mixed Kinesio taping ( KT ) model on range of ankle motion ( ROAM ) , gait , pain , perimeter of lower limbs , and quality of life in postmenopausal women with chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) .
METHODS	Double-blinded , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Clinical setting .
METHODS	Consecutive postmenopausal women ( N = @ ; mean age SD , @ y ) with mild CVI .
METHODS	No participant withdrew because of adverse effects .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to either ( @ ) an experimental group to receive a mixed KT-compression treatment following KT recommendations for gastrocnemius muscle enhancement and functional correction of the ankle , and adding @ tapes to simulate traditional compression bandages ( no KT guidelines ) ; or ( @ ) a placebo control group for sham KT .
METHODS	Both interventions were performed @ times a week during a @-week period .
METHODS	ROAM , gait , pain , perimeter of right and left lower limb , and quality of life were assessed at baseline and @ hours posttreatment .
RESULTS	Quality of life was better in the intervention group by a mean of @ points ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The experimental group also showed significant pre - / posttreatment improvements in both lower limbs in gait dorsiflexion ROAM ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , cadence ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , stride length ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , step length ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , stance phase ( @ % CI , @-@ ) , and foot ( @ % CI , @ -@ ) and malleolus ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) circumference .
RESULTS	None of these variables were significantly modified in the placebo group .
RESULTS	Both groups reported a significant reduction in pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Ankle dorsiflexion during gait , walking parameters , peripheral edema , venous pain , and quality of life remain improved in patients with CVI at @ month after mixed KT-compression therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	KT may have a placebo effect on pain perception .

OBJECTIVE	The authors compared psychoanalytic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in the treatment of bulimia nervosa .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial was conducted in which @ patients with bulimia nervosa received either @ years of weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy or @ sessions of CBT over @ months .
METHODS	The main outcome measure was the Eating Disorder Examination interview , which was administered blind to treatment condition at baseline , after @ months , and after @ years .
METHODS	The primary outcome analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis .
RESULTS	Both treatments resulted in improvement , but a marked difference was observed between CBT and psychoanalytic psychotherapy .
RESULTS	After @ months , @ % of patients in CBT ( N = @ ) and @ % of patients in psychoanalytic psychotherapy ( N = @ ) had stopped binge eating and purging ( odds ratio = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ years , @ % in the CBT group and @ % in the psychoanalytic psychotherapy group had stopped binge eating and purging ( odds ratio = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	By the end of both treatments , substantial improvements in eating disorder features and general psychopathology were observed , but in general these changes took place more rapidly in CBT .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the marked disparity in the number of treatment sessions and the duration of treatment , CBT was more effective in relieving binging and purging than psychoanalytic psychotherapy and was generally faster in alleviating eating disorder features and general psychopathology .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings indicate the need to develop and test a more structured and symptom-focused version of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa .

BACKGROUND	Tobacco smoking prevalence continues to be high , particularly among adolescents and young adults with lower educational levels , and is therefore a serious public health problem .
BACKGROUND	Tobacco smoking and problem drinking often co-occur and relapses after successful smoking cessation are often associated with alcohol use .
BACKGROUND	This study aims at testing the efficacy of an integrated smoking cessation and alcohol intervention by comparing it to a smoking cessation only intervention for young people , delivered via the Internet and mobile phone .
METHODS	A two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial with one follow-up assessment after @months will be conducted .
METHODS	Participants in the integrated intervention group will : ( @ ) receive individually tailored web-based feedback on their drinking behaviour based on age and gender norms , ( @ ) receive individually tailored mobile phone text messages to promote drinking within low-risk limits over a @-month period , ( @ ) receive individually tailored mobile phone text messages to support smoking cessation for @months , and ( @ ) be offered the option of registering for a more intensive program that provides strategies for smoking cessation centred around a self-defined quit date .
METHODS	Participants in the smoking cessation only intervention group will only receive components ( @ ) and ( @ ) .
METHODS	Study participants will be @ students who smoke tobacco daily/occasionally , from vocational schools in Switzerland .
METHODS	Main outcome criteria are @-day point prevalence smoking abstinence and cigarette consumption assessed at the @-month follow up .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study testing a fully automated intervention for smoking cessation that simultaneously addresses alcohol use and interrelations between tobacco and alcohol use .
CONCLUSIONS	The integrated intervention can be easily implemented in various settings and could be used with large groups of young people in a cost-effective way .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of intranasal ketamine versus alfentanil in addition to oral midazolam for the prevention of emergence agitation in children .
METHODS	Children undergoing urological surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia received oral midazolam @ min before induction and were then randomly assigned to receive @ mg/kg ketamine , @ g/kg alfentanil or @ ml isotonic saline intranasally .
METHODS	Parental separation status and mask acceptance were assessed preoperatively .
METHODS	Emergence agitation was evaluated using a paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium ( PAED ) score .
RESULTS	Data from @ children were evaluated in the study .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the groups in demographic characteristics , recovery times or parental separation scores .
RESULTS	Mask acceptance was significantly better in the ketamine group than in the saline group .
RESULTS	The mean PAED score in the ketamine group was significantly better than in the other two groups , but was similar in the saline and alfentanil groups .
RESULTS	The incidence of emergence agitation was @ % , @ % and @ % in the ketamine , alfentanil and saline groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of intranasal ketamine to oral midazolam significantly improved the quality of induction and reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation , in children undergoing urological surgery .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of chitosan membrane on wound healing .
METHODS	The effect of chitosan membranes was evaluated in an experimental rat model .
METHODS	On day @ , circular full-thickness skin sections were excised from the scalps of rats .
METHODS	The wounds were then measured and the surrounding area tattooed .
METHODS	Rats were sacrificed either immediately after excision , or randomised into control and chitosan groups and followed up on day @ , @ , @ or @ .
METHODS	Control group wounds were covered with Aquacel ( wound dressing ) .
METHODS	Chitosan group wounds were covered with chitosan membranes and the wound dressing .
METHODS	Wounds and the distances between the tattooed marks were measured on follow-up , the wound sites were harvested and histologically examined , and serum interleukin ( IL-@ ) levels were analysed .
RESULTS	A total of @ rats were examined and all time points included @ control and @ chitosan treated animals , except for day @ which consisted of control animals only .
RESULTS	On day @ , wounds in the chitosan group were significantly ( p < @ ) smaller ( @ % versus @ % of the original wound area ) than in the control group .
RESULTS	Chitosan membranes were found to degrade at the wound sites between days @ and @ .
RESULTS	Leukocyte counts were lower in the chitosan group than in the control group on day seven ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	IL-@ levels were significantly higher on day @ ( p < @ ) and @ ( p < @ ) in the chitosan group .
CONCLUSIONS	According to our results chitosan membrane may promote early wound healing , reduce inflammation and affect the IL-@ pathway , however , the membrane degrades at the wound site after day @ .

BACKGROUND	The treatment of symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease with intravenous ganciclovir for @ weeks has been shown to improve audiologic outcomes at @ months , but the benefits wane over time .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , placebo-controlled trial of valganciclovir therapy in neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease , comparing @ months of therapy with @ weeks of therapy .
METHODS	The primary end point was the change in hearing in the better ear ( `` best-ear '' hearing ) from baseline to @ months .
METHODS	Secondary end points included the change in hearing from baseline to follow-up at @ and @ months and neurodevelopmental outcomes , with each end point adjusted for central nervous system involvement at baseline .
RESULTS	A total of @ neonates underwent randomization , of whom @ had follow-up data at @ months that could be evaluated .
RESULTS	Best-ear hearing at @ months was similar in the @-month group and the @-week group ( @ and @ participants , respectively , had improvement ; @ and @ had no change ; and @ and @ had worsening ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Total-ear hearing ( hearing in one or both ears that could be evaluated ) was more likely to be improved or to remain normal at @ months in the @-month group than in the @-week group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The benefit in total-ear hearing was maintained at @ months ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ months , the @-month group , as compared with the @-week group , had better neurodevelopmental scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development , third edition , on the language-composite component ( P = @ ) and on the receptive-communication scale ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Grade @ or @ neutropenia occurred in @ % of the participants during the first @ weeks .

BACKGROUND	Previous research suggests that African American smokers may have improved outcomes if interventions are culturally specific .
BACKGROUND	However , few interventions sufficiently address the unique needs of this population in a format with large reach potential .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a newly developed digital video disc ( DVD ) - based cessation intervention targeting African Americans .
METHODS	In a @-arm randomized trial , smokers ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to view either the new Pathways to Freedom ( PTF ) DVD or a standard control DVD .
METHODS	Participants were assessed at baseline , immediately postviewing the DVD , and at a @-month follow-up .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were feasibility and process variables , including intervention evaluations , readiness to quit , and risk perceptions , and smoking-related behavior changes were examined as secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	Findings demonstrated the hypothesized positive effects of the PTF DVD compared with the control DVD on content evaluations , risk perceptions , and readiness to quit at follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	We found initial evidence for the efficacy of the PTF DVD as a stand-alone intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research will test the efficacy of the DVD for smoking cessation in a larger randomized trial .
CONCLUSIONS	The ultimate goal of this research is to validate a new intervention for an underserved community of smokers that can be used in multiple settings , such as community health clinics , primary care , quitlines , cessation clinics , and seminars/workshops .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the normal ranges and the clinical relevance of multidirectional systolic parameters to evaluate global left ventricular ( LV ) systolic function .
METHODS	Three hundred twenty-three healthy adult subjects prospectively included at @ centers and a cohort of @ patients with hypertension were analyzed .
METHODS	Multidirectional global LV systolic function was analyzed using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography by means of two indices : longitudinal-circumferential systolic index ( the average of longitudinal and circumferential global systolic strain ) and global systolic index ( the average of longitudinal , circumferential , and radial global systolic strain ) .
RESULTS	The ranges of values of the multidirectional systolic parameters in healthy subjects were -@ @ % for longitudinal-circumferential systolic index and @ @ % for global systolic index .
RESULTS	In addition , the lowest expected values of these multidirectional indices were determined in this population ( calculated as -@ SDs from the mean ) : -@ % for longitudinal-circumferential systolic index and @ % for global systolic index .
RESULTS	Concerning the clinical relevance of these measurements , these indices indicated the presence of subtle LV global systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension , even though LV global longitudinal systolic strain and LV ejection fraction were normal .
RESULTS	Moreover , in these patients , functional class ( dyspnea -LSB- New York Heart Association classification -RSB- ) was inversely related to both the longitudinal-circumferential index and the global systolic index .
CONCLUSIONS	In the present multicenter study analyzing a large cohort of healthy subjects and patients with hypertension , the normal range and the clinical relevance of multidirectional systolic parameters to evaluate global LV systolic function have been determined .

METHODS	Curcumin revealed various health-beneficial properties in numerous studies .
METHODS	However its bioavailability is low due to its limited intestinal uptake and rapid metabolism .
METHODS	The aim of our project was to develop novel curcumin formulations with improved oral bioavailability and to study their safety as well as potential sex-differences .
RESULTS	In this crossover study , healthy subjects ( @ women , @ men ) took , in random order , a single oral dose of @ mg curcuminoids as native powder , micronized powder , or liquid micelles .
RESULTS	Blood and urine samples were collected for @ h and total curcuminoids and safety parameters were quantified .
RESULTS	Based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) , the micronized curcumin was @ - , @ - , and @-fold and micellar curcumin @ - , @ - , and @-fold better bioavailable than native curcumin in women , men , and all subjects , respectively .
RESULTS	Thus , women absorbed curcumin more efficiently than men .
RESULTS	All safety parameters remained within the reference ranges following the consumption of all formulations .
CONCLUSIONS	Both , the micronized powder and in particular the liquid micellar formulation of curcumin significantly improved its oral bioavailability without altering safety parameters and may thus be ideally suited to deliver curcumin in human intervention trials .
CONCLUSIONS	The observed sex differences in curcumin absorption warrant further investigation .

OBJECTIVE	This study aims to determine the difference between transcervical resection of septum ( TCRS ) and transcervical incision of septum ( TCIS ) in the improvement of reproductive prognosis .
METHODS	Women with uterine septum in the Affiliated Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were retrospectively analyzed .
METHODS	A statistical method was used according to operative time , postoperative menstruation , postoperative pregnancy rate , postoperative term delivery rate , and so on .
RESULTS	Compared with TCRS , the TCIS method decreased operative time , blood loss , and consumption of uterus distension medium .
RESULTS	No statistical difference was observed in operative complications between the two methods .
RESULTS	After TCIS , the incidence of uterine adhesion was low and the degree of endometrial epithelialisation was high by hysteroscopy review .
RESULTS	No statistical difference was observed in residual septum after the operation .
RESULTS	The total pregnancy rate after TCIS was higher than that of TCRS .
RESULTS	However , no statistical difference was observed in early and late pregnancy loss rates , preterm birth rate , and term birth rate .
CONCLUSIONS	TCIS exhibits advantages of decreasing operative time , blood loss , and consumption of uterus distension medium .
CONCLUSIONS	TCIS can reduce the incidence of uterine adhesion and can promote endometrial epithelialisation , which are the key factors to increase pregnancy rate after operation .

OBJECTIVE	Major depressive disorder has been linked with inflammatory processes , but it is unclear whether individual differences in levels of inflammatory biomarkers could help match patients to treatments that are most likely to be beneficial .
OBJECTIVE	The authors tested the hypothesis that C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , a commonly available marker of systemic inflammation , predicts differential response to escitalopram ( a serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) and nortriptyline ( a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ) .
METHODS	The hypothesis was tested in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression ( GENDEP ) study , a multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	CRP was measured with a high-sensitivity method in serum samples from @ adult men and women with major depressive disorder randomly allocated to @-week treatment with escitalopram ( N = @ ) or nortriptyline ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the score on the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , administered weekly .
RESULTS	CRP level at baseline differentially predicted treatment outcome with the two antidepressants ( CRP-drug interaction : = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	For patients with low levels of CRP ( < @ mg/L ) , improvement on the MADRS score was @ points higher with escitalopram than with nortriptyline .
RESULTS	For patients with higher CRP levels , improvement on the MADRS score was @ points higher with nortriptyline than with escitalopram .
RESULTS	CRP and its interaction with medication explained more than @ % of individual-level variance in treatment outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	An easily accessible peripheral blood biomarker may contribute to improvement in outcomes of major depressive disorder by personalizing treatment choice .

BACKGROUND	Alpha adrenergic drugs are usually used in the treatment of erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction in humans .
BACKGROUND	The influence of such drugs on the seminal characteristics of wild animals has not been verified ; whereas their impact on the seminal characteristics and erectile and ejaculatory functions of collared peccaries ( Tayassu tajacu ) has already been determined .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed at investigating and comparing the effects of medetomidine and atipamezole on the seminal variables of collared peccaries undergoing electroejaculation as well as at determining whether these drugs affected the erectile and ejaculatory functions of this species .
RESULTS	A statistically significant difference in sperm concentration was observed between AP ( @ @ @ sperm/ml ) and MP ( @ @ @ sperm/ml ) ; however , both these treatments did not differ from P treatment ( @ @ @ sperm/ml ) .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference was observed among all treatments with regard to erectile function .
RESULTS	With regard to ejaculation time , no significant difference was observed between the MP and AP treatments ; however , when compared with the P treatment , AP exhibited a significantly higher difference .
CONCLUSIONS	When collared peccaries were anesthetized with propofol , neither medetomidine nor atipamezole significantly affected the characteristics of the semen or the erectile function , despite the fact that the AP treatment increased ejaculation time .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the data indicate that using propofol alone is an effective anesthetic protocol for collecting semen in collared peccaries .
CONCLUSIONS	Other non-injectable anesthetic drugs , such as inhaled anesthetics , may be used in future research to collect semen from peccaries .

BACKGROUND	Tinnitus is a result of hyper-activity/hyper-synchrony of auditory neurons coding the tinnitus frequency , which has developed to synchronous mass activity owing the lack of inhibition .
BACKGROUND	We assume that removal of exactly these frequency components from an auditory stimulus will cause the brain to reorganize around tonotopic regions coding the tinnitus frequency .
BACKGROUND	Based on this assumption a novel treatment for tonal tinnitus - tailor-made notched music training ( TMNMT ) ( Proc Natl Acad Sci USA @:@ -@ , @ ; Ann N Y Acad Sci @:@ -@ , @ ; Frontiers Syst Neurosci @:@ , @ ) has been introduced and will be tested in this clinical trial on a large number of tinnitus patients .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) in parallel group design will be performed in a double-blinded manner .
METHODS	The choice of the intervention we are going to apply is based on two `` proof of concept '' studies in humans ( Proc Natl Acad Sci USA @:@ -@ , @ ; Ann N Y Acad Sci @:@ -@ , @ ; Frontiers Syst Neurosci @:@ , @ ; PloS One @ ( @ ) : e@ , @ ) and on a recent animal study ( Front Syst Neurosci @:@ , @ ) .
METHODS	The RCT includes @ participants with chronic , tonal tinnitus who listened to tailor-made notched music ( TMNM ) for two hours a day for three months .
METHODS	The effect of TMNMT is assessed by the tinnitus handicap questionnaire and visual analogue scales ( VAS ) measuring perceived tinnitus loudness , distress and handicap .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomized controlled trial applying TMNMT on a larger number of patients with tonal tinnitus .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data will verify more securely and reliably the effectiveness of this kind of completely non-invasive and low-cost treatment approach on tonal tinnitus .

OBJECTIVE	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic autoimmune disease where TNF - is a central mediator of inflammation , and is cleaved from the cell surface by TACE/ADAM@ .
OBJECTIVE	This metalloproteinase is also responsible for the release of soluble ( s ) CD@ .
OBJECTIVE	Soluble CD@ reflects macrophage activation .
OBJECTIVE	In RA , sCD@ has been suggested as a marker of disease activity and progression .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim is to investigate sCD@ levels in early RA patients .
METHODS	Soluble CD@ was measured by ELISA from @ RA plasma samples from the OPERA trial .
METHODS	Averaged disease duration was three months , prior to randomisation with methotrexate ( MTX ) and adalimumab ( DMARD+ADA ) or MTX and placebo ( DMARD+PLA ) .
METHODS	Soluble CD@ levels were evaluated in relation to clinical disease parameters .
RESULTS	Plasma sCD@ at baseline was @ mg/l ( @ mg/l -@ mg/l ) , mean ( @ % CI ) , vs healthy controls : @ mg/l ( @ mg/l - @ mg/l ) , ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	After three months of treatment sCD@ levels decreased significantly ( average @ % ) in both treatment groups .
RESULTS	Significant incremental sCD@ levels followed withdrawal of ADA after @ months of treatment .
RESULTS	Baseline sCD@ correlated with CRP and all investigated disease activity markers ( = @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the DMARD+PLA group baseline sCD@ also correlated with CRP during the follow-up period .
CONCLUSIONS	Soluble CD@ correlated with disease activity markers in early RA before treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Plasma sCD@ may add to currently available disease measures by specifically reflecting changes in macrophage activity as evidenced by increasing levels following anti-TNF withdrawal , despite maintenance of a stable clinical condition achieved by conventional remedies .
CONCLUSIONS	It remains to be determined whether sCD@ is an early predictor of disease flare .

BACKGROUND	Whether patients with early-stage oral cancers should be treated with elective neck dissection at the time of the primary surgery or with therapeutic neck dissection after nodal relapse has been a matter of debate .
METHODS	In this prospective , randomized , controlled trial , we evaluated the effect on survival of elective node dissection ( ipsilateral neck dissection at the time of the primary surgery ) versus therapeutic node dissection ( watchful waiting followed by neck dissection for nodal relapse ) in patients with lateralized stage T@ or T@ oral squamous-cell carcinomas .
METHODS	Primary and secondary end points were overall survival and disease-free survival , respectively .
RESULTS	Between @ and @ , a total of @ patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	As prespecified by the data and safety monitoring committee , this report summarizes results for the first @ patients ( @ in the elective-surgery group and @ in the therapeutic-surgery group ) , with a median follow-up of @ months .
RESULTS	There were @ recurrences and @ deaths in the elective-surgery group and @ recurrences and @ deaths in the therapeutic-surgery group .
RESULTS	At @ years , elective node dissection resulted in an improved rate of overall survival ( @ % ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ) , as compared with therapeutic dissection ( @ % ; @ % CI , @ to @ ) , for a hazard ratio for death of @ in the elective-surgery group ( @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ by the log-rank test ) .
RESULTS	At that time , patients in the elective-surgery group also had a higher rate of disease-free survival than those in the therapeutic-surgery group ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Elective node dissection was superior in most subgroups without significant interactions .
RESULTS	Rates of adverse events were @ % and @ % in the elective-surgery group and the therapeutic-surgery group , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with early-stage oral squamous-cell cancer , elective neck dissection resulted in higher rates of overall and disease-free survival than did therapeutic neck dissection .
CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by the Tata Memorial Centre ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

OBJECTIVE	Transesophageal echocardiography has become a standard tool for evaluating left ventricular function during cardiac surgery .
OBJECTIVE	However , the image quality varies widely between patients and examinations .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the image quality on @ commonly used @-dimensional methods .
METHODS	Transesophageal real-time @-dimensional echocardiography ( @DE ) served as a reference .
METHODS	Left ventricular function was evaluated in @ patients with sufficient real-time @DE image quality .
METHODS	The image quality was rated using the ratio of the visualized border divided by the total endocardial border .
METHODS	These ratings were used to generate groups of poor ( @ % -@ % ) , fair ( @ % -@ % ) , and good ( @ % -@ % ) image quality .
METHODS	The ejection fraction ( EF ) , end-diastolic volume , and end-systolic volume were analyzed by the Simpson method of disks ( biplane and monoplane ) , eyeball method , Teichholz method , and speckle-tracking method .
METHODS	Furthermore , the fractional area change was determined .
METHODS	Each correlation with real-time @DE was evaluated .
RESULTS	Correlations of the EF and volumes , respectively , as determined by long-axis view methods increased with improving image quality : the Simpson biplane method was found to be the most accurate method , with good image quality for the EF ( r = @ ) and volumes ( end-diastolic volume , r = @ ; end-systolic volume , r = @ ) .
RESULTS	Correlations of the EF and fractional area change by short-axis view methods decreased with improving image quality , with the Teichholz EF found to be most accurate with poor ( r = @ ) in contrast to good ( r = @ ) image quality .
CONCLUSIONS	With good image quality , the Simpson biplane method is the most accurate @-dimensional method for assessing the left ventricular EF .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-axis view methods , especially the Teichholz method yield better correlations with poor image quality .
CONCLUSIONS	The eyeball method was unaffected by image quality .

BACKGROUND	In this study , we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of tight glucose control during cardiopulmonary bypass on myocardium in adult nondiabetic patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement in a prospective and randomized trial .
METHODS	Sixty-five adult nondiabetic patients undergoing selective isolated aortic valve replacement were enrolled and randomly assigned to an insulin group ( patients received a continuous insulin infusion during surgery ; n = @ ) or a control group ( patients were not administered insulin unless their blood glucose level exceeded @ mg/dL ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Cardiac troponin I was assayed preoperatively , and then at @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ hours after aortic cross-declamping .
METHODS	The pre - , intra - , and postoperative relevant data of all selected patients were analyzed .
RESULTS	Tight glucose control reduced postoperative peak release by @ % for cardiac troponin I compared with the control group ( @ @ vs @ @ ng/mL ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with continuous insulin infusion had lower peak inotropic score during the first postoperative @ hours and peak level of blood glucose ( @ @ vs @ @ g/kg/min ; P < @ ; @ @ vs @ @ mg/dL ; P < @ , respectively ) , shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay and hospital stay compared with the control group ( @ @ hours vs @ @ hours ; P = @ ; @ @ hours vs @ @ hours ; P < @ ; @ @ days vs @ @ days ; P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Tight glucose control during cardiopulmonary bypass might provide myocardial protection in adult nondiabetic patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement .

OBJECTIVE	The decision of whether to retain or remove a previously placed cervical cerclage in women who subsequently rupture fetal membranes in a premature gestation is controversial and all studies to date are retrospective .
OBJECTIVE	We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial of removal vs retention of cerclage in these patients to determine whether leaving the cerclage in place prolonged gestation and/or increased the risk of maternal or fetal infection .
METHODS	A prospective randomized multicenter trial of @ hospitals was performed .
METHODS	Patients included were those with cerclage placement at @ weeks @ days in singleton or twin pregnancies , with subsequent spontaneous rupture of membranes between @ weeks @ days and @ weeks @ days .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to retention or removal of cerclage .
METHODS	Patients were then expectantly managed and delivered only for evidence of labor , chorioamnionitis , fetal distress , or other medical or obstetrical indications .
METHODS	Management after @ weeks was at the clinician 's discretion .
RESULTS	The initial sample size calculation determined that a total of @ patients should be included but after a second interim analysis , futility calculations determined that the conditional power for showing statistical significance after randomizing @ patients for the primary outcome of prolonging pregnancy was @ % .
RESULTS	Thus the study was terminated after a total of @ subjects were randomized with complete data available for analysis , @ to removal and @ to retention of cerclage .
RESULTS	There was no statistical significance in primary outcome of prolonging pregnancy by @ week comparing the @ groups ( removal @/@ , @ % ; retention @/@ , @ % ) P = @ ; or chorioamnionitis ( removal @/@ , @ % ; retention @/@ , @ % ) P = @ , respectively .
RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in composite neonatal outcomes ( removal @/@ , @ % ; retention @/@ , @ % ) , fetal/neonatal death ( removal @/@ , @ % ; retention @/@ , @ % ) ; or gestational age at delivery ( removal mean @ days ; retention mean @ days ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Statistically significant differences were not seen in prolongation of latency , infection , or composite neonatal outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	However , there was a numerical trend in the direction of less infectious morbidity , with immediate removal of cerclage .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may not have met statistical significance if the original sample size of @ was obtained , however they provide valuable data suggesting that there may be no advantage to retaining a cerclage after preterm premature rupture of membranes and a possibility of increased infection with cerclage retention .

BACKGROUND	Many physicians believe that the most effective way to treat chronic urticaria is to take a nonsedating second-generation H@ - antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H@ - antihistamine , usually hydroxyzine , at night to enhance sleep .
BACKGROUND	But is this belief well founded ?
OBJECTIVE	To test this belief by comparing the effectiveness and prevalence of unwanted sedative effects when treating patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU ) with levocetirizine @ mg daily plus hydroxyzine @ mg at night ( levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine ) vs. levocetirizine @ mg daily ( levocetirizine monotherapy ) .
METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind , cross-over study , @ patients with difficult-to-treat CSU took levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine or levocetirizine monotherapy for periods of @ days each .
METHODS	At the end of each treatment period , assessments were made of quality of life ( Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire , CU-Q@ oL ) , severity of urticaria symptoms ( Urticaria Activity Score , UAS ) , sleep disturbance during the night and daytime somnolence .
RESULTS	Both treatments significantly decreased UAS , night-time sleep disturbances and CU-Q@ oL scores ( P < @ ) without significant differences between the two .
RESULTS	Compared with baseline , daytime somnolence was significantly reduced by levocetirizine monotherapy ( P = @ ) but not by levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Direct comparison of the two treatment modalities in terms of daytime somnolence favoured levocetirizine monotherapy ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The widespread belief that sleep is aided by the addition of a sedating first-generation H@ - antihistamine , usually hydroxyzine , at night is not supported .
CONCLUSIONS	These results are in line with the urticaria guidelines , which state that first-line treatment for urticaria should be new-generation , nonsedating H@ - antihistamines only .

BACKGROUND	Lignin peroxidase is a cosmetic skin-lightening alternative that breaks down plant cell walls and melanin .
OBJECTIVE	This research examined the topical efficacy of lignin peroxidase in pigment lightening .
METHODS	Sixty women aged @ to @ years with mild to moderate facial dyspigmentation were enrolled for @ weeks in @ cohorts .
METHODS	Cohort @ applied lignin peroxidase to @ randomized side of the face and nothing to the opposite side .
METHODS	Cohort @ applied lignin peroxidase to @ facial side and generic hydroquinone to the other .
METHODS	Investigator , subject , and dermospectrophotometer measurements were obtained .
RESULTS	In cohort @ , improved skin texture ( P < @ ) , roughness ( P < @ ) , and overall appearance ( P = @ ) was noted at week @ with lignin peroxidase versus no treatment .
RESULTS	By week @ , there was a decrease in spot size with lignin peroxidase versus no treatment ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This was confirmed by a statistically significant reduction in melanin scores with the dermospectrophotometer on lignin peroxidase-treated side at weeks @ , @ , and @ ( P = @ ) and a similar reduction in Melasma Area Severity Index score .
RESULTS	Cohort @ demonstrated parity between lignin peroxidase and hydroquinone , but lignin peroxidase was statistically superior in skin texture and roughness .
CONCLUSIONS	The sample size was limited .
CONCLUSIONS	Lignin peroxidase might be an over-the-counter skin-lightening preparation with efficacy parity to hydroquinone .

BACKGROUND	Increasing evidence suggests that stromal monocarboxylate transporter @ ( MCT@ ) and carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA IX ) may play key roles in tumor development .
BACKGROUND	However , their clinical value remains largely unexplored in gastric cancer ( GC ) .
BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to determine clinicopathological significance and prognostic values of stromal MCT@ and CA IX in GC .
METHODS	Specimens from @ GC patients were immunohistochemically stained using polyclonal anti-MCT@ and anti-CA IX antibodies .
METHODS	Expression was correlated with patient clinicopathologic characteristics and survival data .
RESULTS	High stromal MCT@ expression was detected in @ of @ ( @ % ) GCs and high CA IX in @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Both high stromal MCT@ and CA IX were correlated with advanced TNM stage ( p = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	High CA IX expression was positively related to depth of invasion ( p = @ ) and positive lymph nodes ( p = @ ) as well .
RESULTS	Survival analysis indicated high expression of stromal MCT@ to be an independent factor in predicting poor overall survival ( OS ) ( HR and @ % CI = @ , @-@ @ , p = @ ) and disease free survival ( DFS ) ( HR and @ % CI = @ , @-@ @ , p = @ ) of GC patients .
RESULTS	However , high CA IX expression exhibited no significant predictive value .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that high expression of stromal MCT@ and CA IX proteins is significantly correlated with GC progression .
CONCLUSIONS	High stromal MCT@ heralds worse outcome of GC patient , suggesting a novel candidate prognostic marker and therapeutic target .

OBJECTIVE	This study reported on correlates of parental perception of their child 's weight status .
OBJECTIVE	Associations between parental misperception ( i.e. , underestimation of the child 's weight ) and parental intention to improve their child 's overweight-related health behaviors and their child meeting guidelines regarding these behaviors were also investigated .
METHODS	Baseline data from the population-based ` Be active , eat right study ' were used .
METHODS	The population for analysis consisted of @ overweight and @ obese five year-old children and their parents .
METHODS	Questionnaires were used to measure parental perception of the child 's weight status , correlates of misperception ( i.e. , child age , child gender , child BMI , parental age , parental gender , parental country of birth , parental educational level and parental weight status ) , overweight-related health behaviors ( i.e. , child playing outside , having breakfast , drinking sweet beverages , and watching TV ) , and parental intention to improve these behaviors .
METHODS	Height and weight were measured using standardized protocols .
METHODS	Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed .
RESULTS	In total , @ % of the parents misperceived their child 's weight status .
RESULTS	Parental misperception was associated with lower child BMI , the parent being the father , a foreign parental country of birth , and a lower parental education level ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Parental misperception was not associated with parental intention to improve child overweight-related health behavior , nor with child meeting the guidelines of these behaviors .
CONCLUSIONS	This study showed that almost half of the parents with an overweight or obese child misperceived their child 's weight status .
CONCLUSIONS	A correct parental perception may be a small stepping-stone in improving the health of overweight and obese children .

BACKGROUND	Ebola virus and Marburg virus cause serious disease outbreaks with high case fatality rates .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two investigational DNA vaccines , one ( EBO vaccine ) encoding Ebola virus Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins and one ( MAR ) encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein .
METHODS	RV @ was a phase @b , double-blinded , randomised , placebo-controlled clinical trial in Kampala , Uganda to examine the safety and immunogenicity of the EBO and MAR vaccines given individually and concomitantly .
METHODS	Healthy adult volunteers aged @-@ years were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive three injections of vaccine or placebo at weeks @ , @ , and @ , with vaccine allocations divided equally between three active vaccine groups : EBO vaccine only , MAR vaccine only , and both vaccines .
METHODS	The primary study objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the vaccines , as assessed by local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events .
METHODS	We also assessed immunogenicity on the basis of antibody responses ( ELISA ) and T-cell responses ( ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining assays ) @ weeks after the third injection .
METHODS	Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment .
METHODS	Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle .
METHODS	This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ participants were enrolled into the study between Nov @ , @ , and April @ , @ .
RESULTS	All @ participants received at least one study injection ( including @ who completed the injection schedule ) and were included in safety and tolerability analyses ; @ for whom data were available were included in the immunogenicity analyses .
RESULTS	Study injections were well tolerated , with no significant differences in local or systemic reactions between groups .
RESULTS	The vaccines elicited antibody and T-cell responses specific to the glycoproteins received and we detected no differences between the separate and concomitant use of the two vaccines .
RESULTS	@ of @ ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ ) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein , as did @ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
RESULTS	@ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein , as did @ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
RESULTS	Nine of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) participants in the MAR vaccine groups had an antibody response to the Marburg glycoprotein , as did seven of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
RESULTS	@ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein , as did @ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
RESULTS	@ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein , as did @ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
RESULTS	@ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) participants in the MAR vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Marburg glycoprotein , as did @ of @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the group that received both vaccines .
CONCLUSIONS	This study is the first Ebola or Marburg vaccine trial done in Africa , and the results show that , given separately or together , both vaccines were well tolerated and elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings have contributed to the accelerated development of more potent Ebola virus vaccines that encode the same wild-type glycoprotein antigens as the EBO vaccine , which are being assessed during the @ Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa .

BACKGROUND	Cure of lung cancer is impossible without local tumour control .
BACKGROUND	This can be compromised by accelerated repopulation of tumour cells during radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
BACKGROUND	A strategy to minimise accelerated repopulation might improve local control .
BACKGROUND	We investigated whether concurrent chemo-radiotherapy could be given safely over four weeks .
METHODS	We conducted a randomised phase II trial in which patients with inoperable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) received a radical radiation dose over four weeks rather than conventional fractionation .
METHODS	Treatment was given either sequentially or concurrently with three to four cycles of cisplatinum and vinorelbine .
METHODS	@ patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC and PS @-@ were randomised to receive cisplatinum and vinorelbine with either sequential or concurrent chemo-radiation using @Gy in @ fractions over four weeks .
METHODS	The primary end-point was treatment related mortality .
METHODS	Secondary end-points were toxicity and survival .
RESULTS	Treatment related mortality was : @ % ( exact @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ % ) and @ % ( exact @ % CI @-@ @ % ) for the Concurrent and Sequential group respectively ; relative risk ( RR ) @ ; ( @ % CI @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Toxicity was similar between arms ; grade @ or worse oesophagitis was @ % versus @ % ; RR @ ( @ % CI @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	OS HR was @ ; @ % CI ( @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @ year overall survival rates were : @ % versus @ % ; RR @ ( @ % CI @ , @ ) for Concurrent versus Sequential .
CONCLUSIONS	A strategy to minimise the effects of accelerated repopulation using accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy with chemotherapy is feasible , and reasonably safe for patients with stage III NSCLC .
CONCLUSIONS	The reported two year survival is promising and suggests that a four week regime of radiotherapy should be compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in an adequately powered randomised controlled phase III trial .

BACKGROUND	Pressure injury can lead to increases in hospital length of stay and cost .
BACKGROUND	The sacrum is identified as one of the most common anatomical pressure injury sites for hospitalized patients .
BACKGROUND	Silicone foam border dressings have been proposed as one strategy to reduce pressure injury incidence ; however , rigorous testing of benefit in a general medical-surgical population is required .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Eighty patients will be recruited after assessment of high risk of pressure injury in a large tertiary hospital in south-east Queensland , Australia .
METHODS	Eligible , consenting participants will be randomly allocated to either a control group ( routine care ) or an intervention group ( routine care and a sacral prophylactic dressing ) .
METHODS	The primary outcomes comprise feasibility criteria as identified above .
METHODS	The secondary measure is the presence and severity of sacral pressure injury via blind assessment of digital photographs .
METHODS	Research ethics approval was received in October @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic dressings applied to the sacrum may be an effective method for reducing pressure injury in high-risk general medical-surgical patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , more rigorous studies to confirm benefit are required .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study will determine the feasibility and effect size to inform a larger randomized controlled trial .

METHODS	In this multicentre trial , @ adults with troublesome sub-acute or chronic low-back pain were recruited from @ general practices .
METHODS	Participants were randomised to advice ( control n = @ ) or advice plus CBI ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Compliance was specified a priori as attending a minimum of three group sessions and the individual assessment .
METHODS	We estimated the complier average causal effect ( CACE ) of treatment .
RESULTS	Comparison of the CACE estimate of the mean treatment difference to the intention-to-treat ( ITT ) estimate at @ months showed a greater benefit of CBI amongst participants compliant with treatment on the Roland Morris Questionnaire ( CACE : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ; ITT : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ) , the Modified Von Korff disability score ( CACE : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ; ITT : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ) and the Modified von Korff pain score ( CACE : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ; ITT : @ points , @ % CI @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	People who were non-compliant were younger and had higher pain scores at randomisation .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment compliance is important in the effectiveness of group CBI .
CONCLUSIONS	Younger people and those with more pain are at greater risk of non-compliance .

OBJECTIVE	The use of proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol is known to prevent the gastrointestinal complications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
OBJECTIVE	Rebamipide is known to increase the mucosal generation of prostaglandins and to eliminate free oxygen radicals , thus enhancing the protective function of the gastric mucosa .
OBJECTIVE	However , it is unknown whether rebamipide plays a role in preventing NSAID-induced gastropathy .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of rebamipide compared to misoprostol in preventing NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complications in patients requiring continuous NSAID treatment .
METHODS	We studied @ patients who required continuous NSAID treatment .
METHODS	The patients were randomly assigned to groups that received @ mg of rebamipide three times per day or @ g of misoprostol three times per day for @ weeks .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of the analysis was the occurrence rate of gastric ulcers , as determined by endoscopy after @ weeks of therapy .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients in the study , @ received rebamipide , and @ received misoprostol .
RESULTS	Ultimately , @ patients ( @ % ) withdrew from the misoprostol group and @ patients ( @ % ) withdrew from the rebamipide group .
RESULTS	There was a significant difference in withdrawal rate between the two groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The per protocol analysis set was not valid because of the dropout rate of the misoprostol group ; thus , the intention to treat ( ITT ) analysis set is the main set for the efficacy analysis in this study .
RESULTS	After @ weeks , the occurrence rate of gastric ulcers was similar in the rebamipide and misoprostol groups ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) according to ITT analysis .
RESULTS	In addition , the therapeutic failure rate was similar in the rebamipide and misoprostol groups ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The total severity score of the gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly lower in the rebamipide group than in the misoprostol group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The amount of antacid used was significantly lower in the rebamipide group than in the misoprostol group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Rebamipide can prevent gastric ulcers when used with NSAIDs and can decrease the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with NSAID administration .
CONCLUSIONS	When the possibility of poor compliance and the potential adverse effects of misoprostol are considered , rebamipide appears to be a clinically effective and safe alternative .

RESULTS	There were no completed suicides or deaths , and no clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities observed during the study .
RESULTS	One fluoxetine and one duloxetine patient experienced alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) three or more times the upper limit of normal , which resolved during the study .
RESULTS	A total of @ ( @ % ) duloxetine patients , @ ( @ % ) placebo patients , and @ ( @ % ) fluoxetine patients had worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline during acute treatment .
RESULTS	Of the patients with suicidal ideation at baseline , @/@ ( @ % ) duloxetine , @/@ ( @ % ) placebo , and @/@ ( @ % ) fluoxetine had improvement in suicidal ideation at end-point during acute treatment .
RESULTS	One duloxetine and two fluoxetine patients had treatment-emergent suicidal behavior during the @ week study .
CONCLUSIONS	Trial results were inconclusive , as neither the investigational drug ( duloxetine ) nor the active control ( fluoxetine ) separated from placebo on the CDRS-R at @ weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	No new duloxetine safety signals were identified relative to those seen in adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Trial Registry Number : NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	The @ Eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure ( BP ) recommend a systolic BP threshold for initiation of drug therapy and a therapeutic target of < @ mm Hg in those@ years of age , a departure from prior recommendations of < @ mm Hg .
BACKGROUND	However , it is not known whether this is an optimal choice , especially for the large population with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to evaluate optimal BP in patients@ years of age .
METHODS	Patients @ years of age or older with CAD and baseline systolic BP > @ mm Hg randomized to a treatment strategy on the basis of either atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide or verapamil-SR ( sustained release ) / trandolapril in INVEST ( INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy ) were categorized into @ groups on the basis of achieved on-treatment systolic BP : group @ , < @ mm Hg ; group @ , @ to < @ mm Hg ; and group @,@ mm Hg .
METHODS	Primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death , nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , or nonfatal stroke .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , total MI , nonfatal MI , total stroke , nonfatal stroke , heart failure , or revascularization , tabulated separately .
METHODS	Outcomes for each group were compared in unadjusted and multiple propensity score-adjusted models .
RESULTS	Among @,@ patients included in this analysis with an accumulated @,@ patient-years of follow-up , @,@ ( @ % ) achieved systolic BP of < @ mm Hg ( group @ ) , @,@ ( @ % ) achieved systolic BP of @ to < @ mm Hg ( group @ ) , and @,@ ( @ % ) achieved systolic BP of@ mm Hg ( group @ ) .
RESULTS	In unadjusted models , group @ had the lowest rates of the primary outcome ( @ % vs. @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , all-cause mortality ( @ % vs. @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , cardiovascular mortality ( @ % vs. @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , MI ( @ % vs. @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , total stroke ( @ % vs. @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , and nonfatal stroke ( @ % vs @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) compared with groups @ and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	In multiple propensity score-adjusted models , compared with the reference group of < @ mm Hg ( group @ ) , the risk of cardiovascular mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ to @ ; p = @ ) , total stroke ( adjusted HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) and nonfatal stroke ( adjusted HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ; p = @ ) was increased in the group with BP of @ to < @ mm Hg , whereas the risk of primary outcome , all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , total MI , nonfatal MI , total stroke , and nonfatal stroke was increased in the group with BP@ mm Hg .
CONCLUSIONS	In hypertensive patients with CAD who are@ years of age , achieving a BP target of @ to < @mm Hg as recommended by the JNC-@ panel was associated with less benefit than the previously recommended target of < @ mm Hg .

BACKGROUND	After cardiac surgery , patients receive large amounts of fluid in the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .
BACKGROUND	We plan to conduct a multi-centre randomised controlled trial , of a conservative fluid regime , in patients after cardiac surgery , and have reported results of a feasibility study that evaluated efficacy and safety of the proposed regime .
METHODS	After ethical approval , a single-centre , prospectively randomised interventional study was undertaken .
METHODS	Participants were randomised to either usual care , or to a protocolised algorithm , utilising stroke volume variation , to guide fluid administration to patients who were deemed to have inadequate cardiac output and were likely to be volume responsive .
METHODS	The study protocol lasted from ICU admission to de-sedation or @ h , whichever occurred first .
RESULTS	We randomised @ subjects over @ months .
RESULTS	Less bolus fluid and less total overall fluid volume was administered in the intervention group ( median ( IQR ) @ ml ( @-@ ) and @ ml ( @-@ ; P < @ ) , compared with the usual care group ( @ ml ( @-@ ) and @ ml ( @-@ ; P = @ ) , from ICU admission to extubation .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in incidence of acute kidney injury or the average amount of fluid administered to the usual care group at the beginning compared with the end of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	It is both possible and safe to achieve a significant reduction in the amount of fluid administered to patients , allocated to a conservative fluid protocol .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that a planned multi-centre study is both justified and feasible .

OBJECTIVE	Dexmedetomidine can prolong the duration of local anesthetics , but the effect of retrobulbar dexmedetomidine on the potency of ropivacaine for retrobulbar block has not been investigated .
OBJECTIVE	Our study was designed to determine the effect of retrobulbar dexmedetomidine on ropivacaine for retrobulbar block in children .
METHODS	A group of @ children aged @-@ years scheduled for vitreoretinal surgery who received retrobulbar block were randomly assigned to @ of @ groups : group L ( retrobulbar ropivacaine ) , group LD@ ( ropivacaine plus @ g.kg-@ dexmedetomidine ) , or group LD@ ( ropivacaine plus @ g.kg-@ dexmedetomidine ) .
METHODS	The minimum local anesthetic concentration ( MLAC ) was determined according to a Dixon-Massey protocol .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of the study was MLAC .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were duration of postoperative analgesia , postoperative pain scores , dexmedetomidine side effects , and time to hospital discharge .
RESULTS	The MLAC values of retrobulbar ropivacaine were @ % , @ % , and @ % in groups L , LD@ , and LD@ , respectively .
RESULTS	The median ( interquartile range ) durations of analgesia in the postoperative period were @ ( @-@ ) , @ ( @-@ ) , and @ ( @-@ ) minutes in groups L , LD@ , and LD@ , respectively ( L vs LD@ or LD@ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Wake-up time was significantly increased in groups LD@ and LD@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Retrobulbar dexmedetomidine reduces the MLAC values of ropivacaine and improves postoperative analgesia in children without any neurologic side effects .

BACKGROUND	Empathy improves our ability to communicate in social interactions and motivates prosocial behavior .
BACKGROUND	The neuropeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin play key roles in socioemotional processes such as pair bonding and parental care , which suggests that they may be involved in empathic processing .
METHODS	We investigated how vasopressin and oxytocin affect empathic responding in a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled , between-subjects study design .
METHODS	We also examined the moderating role of parental warmth , as reported in the early family environment , on empathic responding following vasopressin , oxytocin , or placebo administration .
RESULTS	Among participants who reported higher levels of paternal warmth ( but not maternal warmth ) , vasopressin ( vs. placebo and oxytocin ) increased ratings of empathic concern after viewing distressing and uplifting videos .
RESULTS	No main or interaction effects were found for individuals who received oxytocin .
CONCLUSIONS	Vasopressin has a role in enhancing empathy among individuals who received higher levels of paternal warmth .

OBJECTIVE	Levels of stool fatty acid soaps and beneficial bacteria differ between formula-fed and breast-fed infants ; addition of specific formula ingredients may reduce these differences .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the effects of a term infant formula containing high sn-@ palmitate term infant formula ( sn-@ ) or an identical formula supplemented with oligofructose ( OF ) at @ concentrations ( sn-@ +@ g/L OF , sn-@ +@ g/L OF ) on stool composition , stool characteristics , and fecal bifidobacteria .
METHODS	Healthy , term formula-fed infants @ to @ days old ( n = @ ) were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive standard formula ( control ) , sn-@ , sn-@ +@ g/L OF , or sn-@ +@ g/L OF for @ weeks .
METHODS	Human milk ( HM ) - fed infants ( n = @ ) were studied in parallel .
METHODS	Stool samples were collected from all subjects at week @ for fatty acid soaps and mineral content , and from a subset at baseline and week @ for bifidobacteria .
METHODS	Stool characteristics were assessed via @-day diary .
RESULTS	The sn-@ group had @ % less stool soap palmitate ( P < @ ) and softer stools than control ( @ % more mushy soft stools , P = @ ; @ % fewer formed stools , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Addition of OF resulted in even fewer formed stools versus control ( @ % fewer for sn-@ +@ g/L OF , @ % fewer for sn-@ +@ g/L OF ) , with @ g/L OF more closely resembling that of HM-fed infants .
RESULTS	Both sn-@ ( P < @ ) and sn-@ with OF groups ( P < @ ) had significantly higher fecal bifidobacteria concentrations than control at week @ , not differing from HM-fed infants .
CONCLUSIONS	High sn-@-palmitate formulas led to reduced stool soaps , softer stools , and increased bifidobacteria , whereas addition of OF further improved stool consistency .
CONCLUSIONS	Those modifications brought outcomes in formula-fed infants closer to that in HM-fed infants .

OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the effect of exposure to television food advertising on accessibility of food-related cognitions and motivation to eat .
METHODS	We initially developed a word stem completion task to measure accessibility of food-related cognitions .
METHODS	In two subsequent experiments , @ female undergraduate students ( Experiment @ ) and @ overweight or obese community-dwelling women ( Experiment @ ) viewed a series of television commercials advertising either food or non-food products .
METHODS	They then completed the word stem task and also rated their desire to eat .
RESULTS	Exposure to televised food advertisements led to the completion of word stems with more food - and eating-related words in both experiments .
RESULTS	It also increased self-reported desire to eat , but only for overweight and obese individuals ( Experiment @ ) .
RESULTS	In both samples , there was a positive association between accessibility of food-related cognitions and reported desire to eat , following priming with television food advertisements .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that an increased activation of food-related cognitions may provide a mechanism for the link between food advertising and consumption .
CONCLUSIONS	This has implications for tackling pathological ( over ) eating .

BACKGROUND	The study aims to determine whether the route of insulin administration influences glycaemic variability and inflammatory or neurohormonal markers in patients with type @ diabetes and congestive heart failure ( CHF ) exacerbation .
METHODS	Patients ( n = @ ) were randomized to intravenous ( IV ) insulin ( duration @ h ) or subcutaneous ( SQ ) insulin .
METHODS	Inflammatory cytokines and markers of lipid oxidation , high-frequency heart rate variability ( n = @ ) and cardiac impedance ( pre-ejection period , n = @ ) were used to estimate parasympathetic and sympathetic tone in patients with valid cardiac data .
METHODS	Glycaemic variability was measured using a continuous glucose monitor .
RESULTS	Mean glucose was lower ( @ vs @ mmol/L , p = @ ) , coefficient of variation was higher ( p = @ ) and glycaemic lability index was similar on day @ in the IV group compared with the SQ group , but groups were similar by day @ .
RESULTS	The IV group had more confirmed hypoglycaemia ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in hospital readmission or hospital length of stay between groups .
RESULTS	There were no differences in CHF biomarkers , heart rate variability or pre-ejection period between groups .
RESULTS	Increasing log glycaemic lability index was associated with lower on-treatment pre-ejection period ( p = @ ) while increasing coefficient of variation was associated with increasing brain natriuretic peptide ( p = @ ) and paroxonase-@ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Other univariable analyses were not significant .
CONCLUSIONS	There were modest , transient differences in glucose control between IV and SQ insulin in hospitalized CHF patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the analyses do not support a link between insulin route and inflammatory markers or autonomic tone .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study is needed to assess outcomes in hospitalized CHF patients .

BACKGROUND	Early identification ( EI ) and brief interventions ( BIs ) for risky drinkers are effective tools in primary care .
BACKGROUND	Lack of time in daily practice has been identified as one of the main barriers to implementation of BI .
BACKGROUND	There is growing evidence that facilitated access by primary healthcare professionals ( PHCPs ) to a web-based BI can be a time-saving alternative to standard face-to-face BIs , but there is as yet no evidence about the effectiveness of this approach relative to conventional BI .
BACKGROUND	The main aim of this study is to test non-inferiority of facilitation to a web-based BI for risky drinkers delivered by PHCP against face-to-face BI .
METHODS	A randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing both interventions will be performed in primary care health centres in Catalonia , Spain .
METHODS	Unselected adult patients attending participating centres will be given a leaflet inviting them to log on to a website to complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT-C ) alcohol screening questionnaire .
METHODS	Participants with positive results will be requested online to complete a trial module including consent , baseline assessment and randomisation to either face-to-face BI by the practitioner or BI via the alcohol reduction website .
METHODS	Follow-up assessment of risky drinking will be undertaken online at @ months and @ year using the full AUDIT and D@-EQD@ scale .
METHODS	Proportions of risky drinkers in each group will be calculated and non-inferiority assessed against a specified margin of @ % .
METHODS	Assuming reduction of @ % of risky drinkers receiving standard intervention , @ patients will be required to give @ % power to reject the null hypothesis .

OBJECTIVE	The hyperglycemic response to surgery may be a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesize that strict maintenance of normoglycemia during cardiac surgery preserves postoperative cognitive function .
METHODS	As part of a larger randomized , single-blind , interventional efficacy study on the effects of hyperinsulinemic glucose control in cardiac surgery ( NCT@ ) , consenting patients were randomly assigned to receive combined administration of insulin and glucose , titrated to preserve normoglycemia ( @-@ @ mmol L ( -@ ) ; experimental group ) , or standard metabolic care ( blood glucose @-@ mmol L ( -@ ) ; control group ) , during open heart surgery .
METHODS	The patients ' cognitive function was assessed during three home visits , approximately two weeks before the operation , and two months and seven months after surgery .
METHODS	The following tests were performed : Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task ( RAVLT for verbal learning and memory ) , Digit Span Task ( working memory ) , Trail Making A & B ( visuomotor tracking and attention ) , and the Word Pair Task ( implicit memory ) .
METHODS	Questionnaires measuring specific traits known to affect cognitive performance , such as self-esteem , depression , chronic stress and social support , were also administered .
METHODS	The primary outcome was to assess the effect of hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp therapy versus standard therapy on specific cognitive parameters in patients receiving normoglycemic clamp , or standard metabolic care .
RESULTS	Twenty-six patients completed the study with @ patients in the normoglycemia and @ patients in the control group .
RESULTS	Multiple analysis of covariance ( MANCOVA ) for the RAVLT showed a significant effect for the interaction of group by visit ( F = @ , p = @ ) , and group by visit by recall ( F = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The differences occurred at the second and third visit .
RESULTS	MANCOVA for the digit span task , trail making and word pair association test showed no significant effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Preserving intraoperative normoglycemia by intravenous insulin and glucose may prevent the impairment of memory function , both short and long-term , after cardiac surgery .

BACKGROUND	Cardiovascular disease and cancer are leading causes of mortality for people with a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders .
BACKGROUND	These chronic diseases share the same four primary behavioural risk factors i.e. excessive alcohol use , smoking , low intake of fruit and vegetables and physical inactivity .
BACKGROUND	In addition to addressing problematic alcohol use , there is the potential for substance abuse treatment services to also address these other behaviours .
BACKGROUND	Healthy Recovery is an @-session group-based intervention that targets these multiple behavioural health risk factors and was developed specifically for people attending substance abuse treatment .
BACKGROUND	This protocol describes a Cancer Institute NSW funded study that assesses the effectiveness of delivering Healthy Recovery for people who are attending residential alcohol and other substance abuse treatment .
METHODS	The study uses a stepped wedge randomised controlled design , where randomisation occurs at the service level .
METHODS	Participants will be recruited from residential rehabilitation programs provided by The Australian Salvation Army .
METHODS	All participants who ( @ ) currently smoke tobacco and ( @ ) are expected to be in the residential program for the duration of the @-week intervention will be asked to participate in the study .
METHODS	Those participants residing at the facilities assigned to the treatment condition will complete Healthy Recovery .
METHODS	The intervention is manual guided and will be delivered over a @-week period , with participants attending @ group sessions .
METHODS	All participants will continue to complete The Salvation Army residential program , a predominantly @-step based , modified therapeutic community .
METHODS	Participants in the control condition will complete treatment as usual .
METHODS	Research staff blind to treatment allocation will complete the primary and secondary outcome assessments at baseline and then at weeks @ , @ and @ weeks post intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	This study will provide comprehensive data on the effect of delivering a healthy lifestyle intervention ( i.e. Healthy Recovery ) within a residential substance abuse setting .
CONCLUSIONS	If shown to be effective , this intervention can be disseminated within other residential substance abuse programs .

OBJECTIVE	Appropriate pain management may positively affect outcome following hip fractures .
OBJECTIVE	Positioning patients for spinal anesthesia ( SA ) can be extremely painful .
OBJECTIVE	Peripheral nerve blockades are gaining popularity in this setting .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective , randomized study compares the efficacy of fascia iliaca compartment block ( FICB ) to intravenous ( IV ) fentanyl for positioning hip fracture patients for SA .
METHODS	Forty-one patients scheduled for hip fracture surgery were randomized to receive a bolus dose of IV fentanyl ( IVFE ) @ g/kg ( IVFE group ) or an FICB using @ mL ropivacaine @ % ( FICB group ) @ or @ minutes before positioning for SA , respectively .
METHODS	Numeric rating pain scale scores before and following the analgesic intervention , time needed and quality of patient position for SA performance , postoperative analgesia in terms of time to first IV morphine dose demand and morphine consumption during the first @ hours , and patient satisfaction were documented .
RESULTS	Compared with the IVFE group , the FICB group showed significantly lower numeric rating pain scale scores in all instances following the analgesic intervention ( P < @ ) , shorter spinal performance time ( P = @ ) , and better quality of position ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Postoperative morphine consumption was lower ( P = @ ) , the time to first dose demand was longer ( P = @ ) , and patient satisfaction rates were higher ( P < @ ) in the FICB group .
CONCLUSIONS	Performing an FICB before positioning for SA provides superior pain management compared with IVFE administration , facilitates spinal performance , and yields satisfactory postoperative analgesia and wide patient acceptance , hence improving overall quality and efficiency of care .

OBJECTIVE	Ginseng root and its derivatives remain atop the most widely used medicinal herbs in cardiovascular disease , despite inadequate substantiation of efficacy .
OBJECTIVE	We previously reported the potential of Korean red ginseng ( KRG ) to affect vascular tone by decreasing arterial wave reflection via an unknown mechanism .
OBJECTIVE	Given the preclinical link between ginseng intake and vasoactivity related to nitric oxide ( NO ) production , we sought to directly evaluate the effects of KRG root and its major root components , on an established noninvasive measure of endothelial function .
METHODS	In an acute , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , crossover design , @ healthy participants ( @M :@ F , age :@ y , BMI : @ kg@kg/m ( @ ) , systolicBP/diastolicBP : @/@mmHg ) on four occasions were administered : KRG root ( @g ) , KRG ginsenosides extract , KRG polysaccharides extract , and cornstarch control .
METHODS	Extracted fractions were delivered at doses bioequivalent to those found in @g of KRG .
METHODS	Flow-mediated vasodilatation ( FMD ) assessment , preceding a brachial blood pressure measurement , was performed at baseline and at @ and @ min posttreatment to assess endothelial function .
RESULTS	KRG significantly improved FMD posttreatment .
RESULTS	Maximal vasodilatation of @ % occurred at @min compared with control ( -@ % , P = @ for all comparisons ) .
RESULTS	The ginsenoside extract produced a comparable response ( @ % ) , but not the polysaccharide fraction ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Brachial blood pressure remained unchanged for all treatments ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	KRG acutely improved endothelial function in healthy individuals , which appears to be attributable to its ginsenoside containing fraction .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data confirm preclinical data and support the potential for these compounds as targets for therapeutic strategies in disorders involving endothelial dysfunction .

OBJECTIVE	The Micropuncture @-gauge needle may reduce complications related to vessel trauma from inadvertent venous or posterior arterial wall puncture .
METHODS	This was a single-center , multiple-user trial .
METHODS	Four hundred and two patients undergoing possible or definite percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) were randomized @:@ to an @-gauge versus a @-gauge needle .
METHODS	Patients and personnel pulling the sheaths and performing the follow-up were blinded .
METHODS	The primary end point was a composite of access bleeding .
METHODS	Events were tabulated following sheath removal , @ h after the procedure and at the follow-up ( at @-@ weeks ) .
METHODS	End points were blindly adjudicated .
RESULTS	The event rate overall was @ % and did not differ significantly between groups , although the @-gauge needle was found to reduce events by more than one third .
RESULTS	An exploratory subgroup analysis of prespecified variables indicated that : patients who did not undergo PCI or elective procedures , female patients and those with a final sheath size of @ Fr all had a significant or near-significant reduction of complications with Micropuncture .
CONCLUSIONS	Although no significant differences between the use of the @ - and @-gauge needles were observed , there was a @-@ % reduction with Micropuncture in several subgroups .
CONCLUSIONS	The study was terminated prematurely .
CONCLUSIONS	Access site complications may be reduced by the use of the @-gauge needle , particularly when the risk of bleeding is not high .
CONCLUSIONS	Further multicenter data will be required to confirm these hypothesis-generating observations .

RESULTS	The quality of life scores derived from MYO health survey questionnaire was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The top three reasons responsible for continuous smoking for all patients failed to quit smoking were : ( @ ) others smoked more than me and still alive and healthy -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) -RSB- ; ( @ ) smoking helped me to keep relaxed and reduce trouble in daily work and life -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) -RSB- ; ( @ ) smoking was essential while chatting and drinking with friends -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	The overall satisfactory rate to this smoking cessation program was @ % and the satisfactory rate was up to @ % by patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Intensive outpatient smoking cessation follow-up program can significantly improve the smoking cessation rates , the guideline drug use rate and the quality of life while reduce medical costs for coronary heart disease patients .

###24439596
BACKGROUND	We conducted a prospective , randomized trial comparing protocol to ad libitum ( ad lib ) feeding after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy .
METHODS	Infants undergoing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy were randomized to protocol versus ad lib feeding strategies .
METHODS	The protocol started with Pedialyte two hours post-operative .
METHODS	This was repeated by another round of Pedialyte , then two rounds of half-strength formula or breast milk , followed by two rounds of full strength formula or breast milk , followed by the home feeding regimen , at which time the patient was discharged if feeding well .
METHODS	The ad lib group was allowed formula or breast milk two hours after the operation and considered for discharge after tolerating three consecutive feeds .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was the length of postoperative hospitalization .
RESULTS	One hundred fifty infants were enrolled between January @ and December @ .
RESULTS	There were no differences in patient characteristics at presentation .
RESULTS	While the ad lib group reached goal feeds sooner than the protocol group , this did not translate into a difference in duration of postoperative hospitalization .
RESULTS	There were more patients with emesis in the ad lib group after goal feeding was reached , but no difference in readmissions .
CONCLUSIONS	Ad lib feeding allows patients to reach goal feeds more rapidly than protocol feeding following laparoscopic pyloromyotomy .
CONCLUSIONS	However , this goal is usually reached beyond discharge hours , resulting in a similar duration of hospitalization .

BACKGROUND	The in utero environment is known to affect fetal development however many of the mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to examine the association between maternal dietary macronutrient intake and lifestyle throughout pregnancy and neonatal weight and adiposity .
METHODS	This was an analysis of @ mother and infant pairs from the ROLO study ( Randomised cOntrol trial of LOw glycaemic index diet versus no dietary intervention to prevent recurrence of fetal macrosomia ) .
METHODS	Food diaries as well as food frequency and lifestyle and physical activity questionnaires were completed during pregnancy .
METHODS	Maternal anthropometry was measured throughout pregnancy and neonatal anthropometry was measured at birth .
RESULTS	Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the main maternal factor associated with increased birth weight was greater gestational weight gain R@adj @ % ( F = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The main maternal factor associated with increased birth length was non-smoking status R@adj @ % ( F = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Neonatal central adiposity ( determined using waist : length ratio ) was negatively associated with maternal age , and positively associated with the following parameters : smoking status , maternal pre-pregnancy arm circumference , percentage energy from saturated fat in late pregnancy , postprandial glucose at @ weeks gestation and membership of the control group with a positive trend towards association with trimester @ glycaemic load R@adj @ % ( F = @ , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Several maternal diet and lifestyle factors were associated with neonatal anthropometry .
CONCLUSIONS	Low glycaemic index dietary intervention in pregnancy was found to have a beneficial effect on neonatal central adiposity .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , central adiposity was positively associated with maternal dietary fat intake and postprandial glucose highlighting the important role of healthy diet in pregnancy in promoting normal neonatal adiposity .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of infliximab versus conventional combination treatment over @months in patients with methotrexate-refractory early rheumatoid arthritis .
METHODS	In this multicentre , two-arm , parallel , randomised , active-controlled , open-label trial , rheumatoid arthritis patients with < @year symptom duration were recruited from @ rheumatology clinics in Sweden between October @ and December @ .
METHODS	After @-@months of methotrexate monotherapy , patients not achieving low disease activity were randomised to addition of infliximab or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine ( conventional treatment group ) .
METHODS	Costs of drugs , healthcare use , and productivity losses were retrieved from nationwide registers , while EuroQol @-Dimensions utility was collected quarterly .
RESULTS	Of @ patients initially enrolled , @ and @ were randomised to infliximab and conventional treatment , respectively .
RESULTS	The infliximab group accumulated higher drug and healthcare costs ( @,@ vs @,@ ; adjusted mean difference @,@ ( @ % CI @,@ to @,@ ) ) , while productivity losses did not differ ( @,@ vs @,@ ; @ ( @ % CI -@ to @,@ ) ) , resulting in higher societal cost compared to the conventional group ( @,@ vs @,@ ; @,@ ( @ % CI @,@ to @,@ ) ) .
RESULTS	Mean accumulated quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) did not differ ( @ vs @ ; adjusted mean difference favouring infliximab treatment @ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) ) .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the infliximab versus conventional treatment strategy were @,@,@ / QALY from the societal perspective and @,@,@ / QALY from the healthcare perspective .
CONCLUSIONS	In early , methotrexate-refractory rheumatoid arthritis , a treatment strategy commencing with addition of infliximab , as compared to sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine , was not cost-effective over @months at willingness to pay levels generally considered acceptable .

###24655054
OBJECTIVE	To identify growth-related collagen and bone parameters in small-for-gestational-age ( SGA ) and appropriate-for-gestational-age ( AGA ) preterm infants during the first six months post-term .
OBJECTIVE	In SGA preterm infants , increased growth and decreased bone acquisition , which we demonstrated previously , may be reflected by these markers .
METHODS	Observational study within a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Thirty-three SGA ( weight , length or both at birth < -@ SDS ) and @ AGA preterm infants ( gestational age -LSB- median ( IQR ) -RSB- : @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) weeks ; @ % vs @ % boys ) .
METHODS	Weight ( g ) , length ( cm ) , procollagen type I N-terminal peptide ( PINP ; g/l ) , urinary helical peptide ( UHP ; g/mmol creatinine ) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ; U/l ) expressed as standard deviation scores ( SDS ) at term age , three and six months post-term .
RESULTS	Weight and length gain during the first six months post-term and PINP SDS at term age , three months and six months post-term were higher in SGA compared with AGA infants .
RESULTS	UHP SDS and ALP SDS were similar in SGA and AGA infants .
RESULTS	PINP SDS and UHP SDS at term age and PINP SDS at three months were associated with subsequent weight and length gain until six months post-term .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased growth in SGA compared with AGA preterm infants is reflected by increased collagen type I synthesis during the first six months post-term , suggesting that PINP and UHP correspond with growth in preterm infants .
CONCLUSIONS	An explanation for decreased bone acquisition of SGA preterm infants may be that increased collagen type I synthesis is not directly followed by increased bone mineralization .

BACKGROUND	Current randomized trials have demonstrated the effects of short-term rosuvastatin therapy in preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CIAKI ) .
BACKGROUND	However , the consistency of these effects on patients administered different volumes of contrast media is unknown .
METHODS	In the TRACK-D trial , @ patients with type @ diabetes and concomitant chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) who underwent coronary/peripheral arterial angiography with or without percutaneous intervention were randomized to short-term ( @ days before and @ days after procedure ) rosuvastatin therapy or standard-of-care .
METHODS	This prespecified analysis compared the effects of rosuvastatin versus standard therapy in patients exposed to ( moderate contrast volume -LSB- MCV -RSB- , @-@ ml , n = @ ) or ( high contrast volume -LSB- HCV -RSB- , @ ml , n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the incidence of CIAKI .
METHODS	The secondary outcome was a composite of death , dialysis/hemofiltration or worsened heart failure at @ days .
RESULTS	Rosuvastatin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in CIAKI compared with the controls ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) in the overall cohort and in patients with MCV ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) , whereas no benefit was observed in patients with HCV ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of secondary outcomes was significantly lower in the rosuvastatin group compared with control group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) in the overall cohort , but it was similar between the patients with MCV ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) or HCV ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Periprocedural short-term rosuvastatin treatment is effective in reducing CIAKI and adverse clinical events for patients with diabetes and CKD after their exposure to a moderate volume of contrast medium .

BACKGROUND	Incisional hernias in old stoma wounds occur in one-third of former stoma patients and pose a significant clinical problem .
BACKGROUND	Parastomal hernias can be prevented by prophylactic mesh placement ; however , no trial results are available for incisional hernia prevention after stoma reversal .
BACKGROUND	In this feasibility study , we explore the safety of placing an intraperitoneal mesh to prevent incisional herniation after temporary stoma reversal .
METHODS	Ten patients who underwent a low anterior resection with a deviating double-loop stoma for rectal cancer received an intraperitoneal parastomal mesh at the time of stoma formation .
METHODS	At stoma reversal , laparoscopy was performed and adhesions were scored .
METHODS	After reversal , the mesh defect was closed .
METHODS	Mesh and stoma complications were closely monitored .
METHODS	Incisional herniation was assessed at the @-year follow-up after stoma reversal using ultrasonography .
RESULTS	No infections occurred after mesh placement .
RESULTS	After a median of @ months , stomas were reversed .
RESULTS	Laparoscopy could be performed in seven patients ; all patients had adhesions ( median of @ % of mesh surface ) .
RESULTS	In three patients , the bowel was involved ; one required a laparotomy for bowel mobilization during stoma reversal .
RESULTS	No adhesion-related morbidity was noted at any time .
RESULTS	Except for one superficial wound infection after stoma reversal , no infectious complications were observed .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months , no incisional herniations were demonstrated .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic mesh placement in temporary stoma formations seems safe and feasible and prevents incisional herniation @ years after stoma reversal .

BACKGROUND	Postoperative readmissions have been proposed by Medicare as a quality metric and can impact provider reimbursement .
BACKGROUND	Because readmission after pancreatectomy is common , we sought to identify factors associated with readmission to establish a predictive risk scoring system .
METHODS	A retrospective analysis of @,@ pancreatectomies performed at @ high-volume pancreatic centers between @ and @ was performed .
METHODS	Forty-five factors strongly associated with readmission were identified .
METHODS	To derive and validate a risk scoring system , the population was randomly divided into @ cohorts in a @:@ fashion .
METHODS	A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed and scores were assigned based on the relative odds ratio ( OR ) of each independent predictor .
METHODS	A composite Readmission after Pancreatectomy ( RAP ) score was generated and then stratified to create risk groups .
RESULTS	Overall , @ ( @ % ) patients were readmitted within @ days .
RESULTS	Eight pre - and postoperative factors , including earlier MI ( OR = @ ) , American Society of Anesthesiologists class @ ( OR = @ ) , dementia ( OR = @ ) , hemorrhage ( OR = @ ) , delayed gastric emptying ( OR = @ ) , surgical site infection ( OR = @ ) , sepsis ( OR = @ ) , and short length of stay ( OR = @ ) were independently predictive of readmission .
RESULTS	The @-point RAP score generated from the derivation cohort was highly predictive of readmission in the validation cohort ( area under the receiver operating curve = @ ) .
RESULTS	The low-risk ( @ to @ ) , intermediate-risk ( @ to @ ) , and high-risk ( > @ ) groups correlated with @ % , @ % , and @ % observed readmission rates , respectively ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The RAP score is a novel and clinically useful risk scoring system for readmission after pancreatectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Identification of patients with increased risk of readmission using the RAP score will allow efficient resource allocation aimed to attenuate readmission rates .
CONCLUSIONS	It also has potential to serve as a new metric for comparative research and quality assessment .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the induction of remission and cost-effectiveness of enteral nutrition ( EN ) and infliximab ( IFX ) in moderate-to-severe active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) .
METHODS	Moderate-to-severe active CD patients were divided into IFX group and EN group .
METHODS	Remission rate , time to remission and treatment cost were compared between the two groups .
METHODS	Clinical remission was defined as Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI ) < @ .
METHODS	The quality of life was evaluated by inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire of quality of life ( IBDQ ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were analyzed , including @ patients in IFX group and @ patients in EN group .
RESULTS	IFX group had higher remission rate -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) vs @ % ( @/@ ) , P = @ -RSB- and shorter time to remission -LSB- ( @ @ ) days vs ( @ @ ) days , P < @ -RSB- than EN group .
RESULTS	Treatment costs before remission were similar in two groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The increase of IBDQ scores before and after treatment in IFX group was much higher than that of EN group ( @ @ vs @ @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , patients in EN group had greater increase of body mass index ( BMI ) than that of IFX group -LSB- ( @ @ ) kg/m ( @ ) vs ( @ @ ) kg/m ( @ ) , P < @ -RSB- .
RESULTS	For patients with CDAI < @ , remission rate was not significantly different -LSB- @ % ( @/@ ) vs @ % ( @/@ ) , P = @ -RSB- between the two groups , while treatment cost in EN group was less than that of IFX group -LSB- ( @ @ ) @ ( @ ) RMB vs ( @ @ ) @ ( @ ) RMB , P = @ -RSB- .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with severe CD ( CDAI @ ) , IFX has higher remission rate , shorter time to remission and comparable treatment cost than EN .
CONCLUSIONS	But for patients with CDAI < @ , EN group has comparable remission rate to IFX group with lower cost .

BACKGROUND	Testicular germ cell cancer ( GCC ) patients treated with cisplatin-etoposide-bleomycin chemotherapy ( BEP ) have excellent prognosis but have an increased risk of late-occurring morbidities , which may be associated with changes in the inflammatory profile .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to explore plasma cytokine concentrations in GCC patients randomized to resistance training or usual care during BEP , in comparison with healthy controls .
METHODS	This was a randomized controlled trial in GCC patients enrolled from an oncology clinic , including a healthy reference group for comparison purposes .
METHODS	Plasma granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , interferon - , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , and TNF - were measured in fasting blood samples from GCC patients randomized to resistance training ( INT ; n = @ ) or usual care ( CON ; n = @ ) and healthy age-matched controls ( REF ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Clinical toxicity assessments and patient-reported end points were also recorded .
RESULTS	CON and INT were balanced at baseline .
RESULTS	Compared with REF , CON had higher concentrations of IL-@ , IL-@ , and interferon - , and INT had higher concentrations of IL-@ , IL-@ and TNF - ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At the end of therapy , concentrations of IL-@ , IL-@ , and IL-@ increased in both GCC groups ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Three months after therapy , all cytokine concentrations were comparable with the pretreatment levels in both GCC-groups but remained elevated compared with REF ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Changes in TNF - correlated with pulmonary toxicity ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At the end of therapy , IL-@ concentrations correlated with quality of life ( P < @ ) and fatigue ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	GCC patients treated with BEP display consistently elevated levels of systemic inflammatory markers compared with healthy controls .
CONCLUSIONS	Resistance training during therapy has no impact on plasma cytokine concentrations .

###25295437
OBJECTIVE	This work tested the hypothesis that patients with high negative affectivity ( NA ) would have a better response to a serotonergic agent ( escitalopram ) than to one not thought to act directly on serotonin ( bupropion ) .
METHODS	Data from a study conducted between August @ and July @ were reanalyzed retrospectively .
METHODS	Patients ( N = @ ) meeting criteria for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR , were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with bupropion extended-release , escitalopram , or the combination .
METHODS	Negative affectivity score was estimated using the guilt , hostility/irritability , and fear/anxiety items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms , and the Social Adjustment Scale .
METHODS	We felt that these items captured published descriptions of the NA construct .
METHODS	A Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness ( CGI-S ) score @ defined response .
METHODS	Because combined treatment addressed both serotonin and non-serotonin systems , patients treated with both medications did not test the hypothesis and so were excluded from the analyses .
RESULTS	Analysis of covariance with treatment as a grouping variable , NA as covariate , and CGI-S as dependent variable showed a significant @-way interaction between treatment and NA ( F , = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the low-NA group , response rates were similar between treatments ( escitalopram : @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; bupropion : @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; NS ) , while there was a significant advantage for escitalopram in patients with high NA ( escitalopram : @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; bupropion = @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that patients with high negative affectivity respond preferentially to antidepressants that selectively enhance serotonin neurotransmission .
CONCLUSIONS	Although patients with low NA appear to benefit from serotonin enhancement as well , they also improved with bupropion , an antidepressant not thought to directly affect serotonin neurotransmission .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings come from retrospective analyses using unproven approximation of NA , so no clinical inferences should be made before independent replication utilizing accepted NA measurement .

BACKGROUND	There is no consensus on the efficacy of postoperative infusion of local anesthetics after radical mastectomy .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-groups clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary hospital .
METHODS	Eighty consecutive women with operable breast cancer with indications for modified radical mastectomy without breast reconstruction were assigned randomly to receive infusion of levobupivacaine ( @ % ) or saline at @ ml/hour for @ hours through a wound catheter .
METHODS	Seventy-three women finished the study ( intervention group , n = @ ; control group , n = @ ) .
METHODS	During surgery , all patients received @ % levobupivacaine ( @ ml ) .
RESULTS	The levobupivacaine group reported less pain ( p < @ ) than controls in the postanesthesia care unit ( @ @ versus @ @ ) and on the ward at @ ( @ @ versus @ @ ) and @ ( @ @ versus @ @ ) hours .
RESULTS	In the postanesthesia care unit , the levobupivacaine group consumed less metamizole ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p < @ ) and dexketoprofen ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p < @ ) , with differences in paracetamol use being insignificant ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	On the ward , the levobupivacaine group used significantly less paracetamol ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p < @ ) and metamizole ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p < @ ) , but differences in dexketoprofen were not significant ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the postanesthesia care unit , the levobupivacaine and control groups consumed @ @ and @ @ doses of opioids ( p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The authors observed no differences in nausea and vomiting at any stage in the postanesthesia care unit ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p = @ ) or on the ward ( @ @ versus @ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	All participants reported high levels of satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	Continuous infusion of local anesthetic reduces pain and analgesic consumption , with high satisfaction , but does not affect rates of nausea and vomiting .

OBJECTIVE	The Interventional Management of Stroke ( IMS ) III study tested the effect of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) alone when compared with intravenous tPA followed by endovascular therapy and collected cost data to assess the economic implications of the @ therapies .
OBJECTIVE	This report describes the factors affecting the costs of the initial hospitalization for acute stroke subjects from the United States .
METHODS	Prospective cost analysis of the US subjects was treated with intravenous tPA alone or with intravenous tPA followed by endovascular therapy in the IMS III trial .
METHODS	Results were compared with expected Medicare payments .
RESULTS	The adjusted cost of a stroke admission in the study was $ @ @ for subjects treated with endovascular therapy after intravenous tPA treatment and $ @ @ for subjects treated with intravenous tPA alone ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant factors related to costs included treatment group , baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale , time from stroke onset to intravenous tPA , age , stroke location , and comorbid diabetes mellitus .
RESULTS	The mean cost for subjects who had routine use of general anesthesia as part of endovascular therapy was $ @ @ when compared with $ @ @ for those who did not have general anesthesia .
RESULTS	The costs of embolectomy for IMS III subjects and patients from the National Inpatient Sample cohort exceeded the Medicare diagnosis-related group payment in @ % of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Minimizing the time to start of intravenous tPA and decreasing the use of routine general anesthesia may improve the cost-effectiveness of medical and endovascular therapy for acute stroke .

BACKGROUND	Dietary linoleic acid ( LA , @:@ n-@ ) lowering in rats reduces n-@ polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) plasma concentrations and increases n-@ PUFA ( eicosapentaenoic ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) concentrations .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the extent to which @ weeks of dietary n-@ PUFA lowering , with or without increased dietary n-@ PUFAs , alters unesterified and esterified plasma n-@ and n-@ PUFA concentrations in subjects with chronic headache .
METHODS	Secondary analysis of a randomized trial .
METHODS	Subjects with chronic headache were randomized for @ weeks to ( @ ) average n-@ , low n-@ ( L@ ) diet ; or ( @ ) high n-@ , low n-@ LA ( H@-L@ ) diet .
METHODS	Esterified and unesterified plasma fatty acids were quantified at baseline ( @ weeks ) and after @ weeks on a diet .
RESULTS	Compared to baseline , the L@ diet reduced esterified plasma LA and increased esterified n-@ PUFA concentrations ( nmol/ml ) , but did not significantly change plasma arachidonic acid ( AA , @:@ n-@ ) concentration .
RESULTS	In addition , unesterified EPA concentration was increased significantly among unesterified fatty acids .
RESULTS	The H@-L@ diet decreased esterified LA and AA concentrations , and produced more marked increases in esterified and unesterified n-@ PUFA concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Dietary n-@ PUFA lowering for @ weeks significantly reduces LA and increases n-@ PUFA concentrations in plasma , without altering plasma AA concentration .
CONCLUSIONS	A concurrent increase in dietary n-@ PUFAs for @ weeks further increases n-@ PUFA plasma concentrations and reduces AA .

OBJECTIVE	Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) has been found to reduce the impact of menopausal symptoms , hot flushes and night sweats .
OBJECTIVE	This study investigates the moderators and mediators of CBT for women who had problematic menopausal symptoms following breast cancer treatment .
METHODS	Analysis of @ patients with breast cancer induced menopausal symptoms recruited to the MENOS@ trial ; @ were randomly assigned to Group CBT and @ to usual care .
METHODS	Questionnaires were completed at baseline , @ and @ weeks post randomisation .
METHODS	Potential moderators and mediators , including sociodemographic , clinical and psychological factors , of the treatment effect on the primary outcome were examined .
METHODS	Hot Flush Problem Rating .
RESULTS	CBT was effective at reducing problem rating at @ weeks regardless of age , BMI , time since breast cancer diagnosis , menopausal status at time of diagnosis , or type of cancer treatment ( radiotherapy or chemotherapy or endocrine treatment ) .
RESULTS	The treatment effect was significantly greater in women not receiving chemotherapy , those with higher levels of psychological distress at baseline and for non-white women .
RESULTS	Beliefs about control/coping with hot flushes were the main mediators of improvement in problem rating following CBT .
RESULTS	Beliefs about hot flushes in a social context , depressed mood and sleep problems were also identified as mediators .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that CBT is widely applicable for breast cancer patients who are experiencing treatment related menopausal symptoms , and that CBT works mainly by changing beliefs and improving mood and sleep .

OBJECTIVE	Opioid-induced androgen deficiency ( OPIAD ) affects patients treated with opioid analgesics .
OBJECTIVE	The norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( NRI ) and - opioid receptor ( MOR ) agonist activities of tapentadol may result in tapentadol having less effect on serum androgen concentrations than analgesics acting through the MOR alone , such as morphine and oxycodone .
OBJECTIVE	The objectives of this publication are to @ ) evaluate the effects of tapentadol ( NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA extended release -LSB- ER -RSB- ) on sex hormone concentrations in healthy male volunteers ( vs placebo and morphine ) and patients with osteoarthritis ( vs placebo and oxycodone ) , and @ ) present a mechanistic hypothesis explaining how the combined MOR agonist and NRI activities of tapentadol may result in less impact on androgen concentrations .
METHODS	Three clinical studies were conducted : study @ ( single-dose comparison study vs morphine in healthy volunteers ) , study @ ( single-dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers without an active comparator ) , and study @ ( multiple-dose study vs oxycodone in patients with osteoarthritis ) .
METHODS	Studies @ and @ were conducted at medical research centers in Germany and the United Kingdom ; study @ was conducted at primary and secondary care centers and medical research centers in the United States .
METHODS	All three studies were randomized , double blind , and placebo controlled .
METHODS	Concentrations of testosterone , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ; study @ only ) were evaluated at @ and @ hours postdose in studies @ and @ , respectively , and at varying time points postdose in study @ .
RESULTS	In study @ , mean serum total testosterone concentrations in healthy male volunteers were similar at baseline for all treatment periods ; @ hours after dosing , mean concentrations were comparable between placebo ( @ nmol/L ) and tapentadol immediate release ( IR ; @ mg , @ nmol/L ; @ mg , @ nmol/L ) , but were lower following administration of morphine IR @ mg ( @ nmol/L ) .
RESULTS	In study @ , there were no or minimal changes in testosterone in the therapeutic dose range with tapentadol IR ( @-@ mg ) , and there was a modest decrease that appeared to level off in the supratherapeutic range ( @-@ mg ) ; mean testosterone and LH concentrations with all doses remained within normal ranges ( testosterone , @-@ @ nmol/L ; LH , @-@ @ U/L ) .
RESULTS	In study @ , the decrease in the mean -LSB- standard deviation -RSB- testosterone concentration from baseline to endpoint for male patients receiving tapentadol ER ( @ mg , -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- nmol/L ; @ mg , -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- nmol/L ) was numerically smaller compared to oxycodone CR ( @ mg , -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- nmol/L ) , but higher compared to placebo ( -@ -LSB- @ -RSB- nmol/L ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that tapentadol , which has combined MOR and NRI activities , may have a lower impact on sex hormone concentrations than pure opioid analgesics , such as morphine or oxycodone .
CONCLUSIONS	The data and mechanistic rationale presented herein provide a justification for conducting additional hypothesis testing studies , and are not intended to be used as a basis for clinical decision making .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies may help elucidate whether the observed trends are clinically significant and would translate into a reduced incidence of OPIAD .

OBJECTIVE	Anemia is associated with poor tumor control .
OBJECTIVE	It was previously observed that accelerated radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide ( ARCON ) can correct this adverse outcome in patients with head and neck cancer .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to validate this observation based on data from a randomized trial .
METHODS	Of @ patients with cT@-@ laryngeal cancer , @ were randomly assigned to accelerated radiotherapy and @ to ARCON .
METHODS	Hemoglobin levels , measured before treatment , were defined as low when < @ mmol/L for women and < @ mmol/L for men .
METHODS	The hypoxia marker pimonidazole was used to assess the oxygenation status in tumor biopsies .
METHODS	Data were analyzed @ years after inclusion of the last patient .
RESULTS	Pretreatment hemoglobin levels were available and below normal in @ of @ ( @ % ) accelerated radiotherapy and @ of @ ( @ % ) ARCON patients .
RESULTS	In patients with normal pretreatment , hemoglobin levels treatment with ARCON had no significant effect on @-year loco-regional control ( LRC , @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) and disease-free survival ( DFS , @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) compared with accelerated radiotherapy .
RESULTS	However , in patients with low pretreatment , hemoglobin levels ARCON significantly improved @-year LRC ( @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) and DFS ( @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis including other prognostic factors , pretreatment hemoglobin remained prognostic for LRC and DFS in the accelerated radiotherapy treatment arm .
RESULTS	No correlation between pretreatment hemoglobin levels and pimonidazole uptake was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Results from the randomized phase III trial support previous observations that ARCON has the potential to correct the poor outcome of cancer patients with anemia ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	In a recent phase II study of onartuzumab ( MetMAb ) , patients whose non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tissue scored as positive for MET protein by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) experienced a significant benefit with onartuzumab plus erlotinib ( O+E ) versus erlotinib .
OBJECTIVE	We describe development and validation of a standardized MET IHC assay and , retrospectively , evaluate multiple biomarkers as predictors of patient benefit .
METHODS	Biomarkers related to MET and/or EGF receptor ( EGFR ) signaling were measured by IHC , FISH , quantitative reverse transcription PCR , mutation detection techniques , and ELISA .
RESULTS	A positive correlation between IHC , Western blotting , and MET mRNA expression was observed in NSCLC cell lines/tissues .
RESULTS	An IHC scoring system of MET expression taking proportional and intensity-based thresholds into consideration was applied in an analysis of the phase II study and resulted in the best differentiation of outcomes .
RESULTS	Further analyses revealed a nonsignificant overall survival ( OS ) improvement with O+E in patients with high MET copy number ( mean@ copies/cell by FISH ) ; however , benefit was maintained in `` MET IHC-positive '' / MET FISH-negative patients ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	MET , EGFR , amphiregulin , epiregulin , or HGF mRNA expression did not predict a significant benefit with onartuzumab ; a nonsignificant OS improvement was observed in patients with high tumor MET mRNA levels ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with low baseline plasma hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) exhibited an HR for OS of @ ( P = @ ) in favor of onartuzumab treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	MET IHC remains the most robust predictor of OS and progression-free survival benefit from O+E relative to all examined exploratory markers .

OBJECTIVE	Energy deficit ( ED ) diminishes fat-free mass ( FFM ) with concomitant reductions in anabolic hormone secretion .
OBJECTIVE	A modest increase in protein to recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) levels during ED minimally attenuates decrements in insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) .
OBJECTIVE	The impact of dietary protein above the RDA on circulating anabolic hormones and their relationships with FFM in response to ED are not well described .
METHODS	Thirty-three adults were assigned diets providing protein at @ ( RDA ) , @ ( @-RDA ) , and @ ( @-RDA ) g/kg/d for @days .
METHODS	Testosterone , sex-hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) and IGF-I system components were assessed after a @-day period of weight-maintenance ( WM ) and after a @-day period of ED ( @ % ) achieved by an increase in energy expenditure and decreased energy intake .
METHODS	Associations between the change in FFM and anabolic hormone levels were determined .
RESULTS	As compared to WM and regardless of dietary protein intake , total and free testosterone , total IGF-I , and acid-labile subunit decreased ( P < @ ) , whereas SHBG and IGF binding proteins-@ , -@ , and -@ increased ( P < @ ) during ED .
RESULTS	There were no energy-by-protein interactions on any hormones or IGF-I system components measured .
RESULTS	Changes in FFM in response to ED were negatively associated with acid-labile subunit ( ALS ) ( r = -@ , P < @ ) in @-RDA ; however , no other relationships were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Consuming a high protein diet does not impact the androgenic and IGF-I system response to ED .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that the protective effects of high protein diets on FFM during ED are likely not influenced by anabolic hormone concentrations .

BACKGROUND	After renal transplantation , postoperative pain is usually mild to moderate .
BACKGROUND	Postoperative pain is a concern and administration of systemic analgesic may be difficult because of underlying co-morbidities and variable responses of the graft .
BACKGROUND	The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block is one of the different approaches for postoperative pain relief following abdominal surgeries .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated analgesic efficacy of TAP block on early postoperative pain by numeric rating scale ( NRS ) and morphine consumption during the first @ hours after kidney transplantation .
METHODS	Forty-four patients , scheduled as kidney recipients were randomized into two equal groups and were anesthetized with the same technique .
METHODS	After the induction of anesthesia , @mL of @ % Bupivacaine plus @/ml epinephrine or saline was deposited into the transversus abdominis neuro-fascial plane on the side of surgery by ultrasound guide .
METHODS	Each patient was assessed by a blinded investigator using NRS at @st , @th , @th , @th , and @th hour postoperatively .
RESULTS	Demographic data were not significantly different between the study groups .
RESULTS	There was significant difference in median of NRS score measured at all time points in the study groups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-hour morphine consumption ( meanSD ) was @ mg in bupivacaine group compared with @ mg in the saline group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was statistically significant reduction in intraoperative fentanyl consumption in the TAP group @g compared to the control group @g ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In study group @ patients and in control group @ patients received morphine titration for pain relief ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no complication in the study groups related to nerve block .
RESULTS	Only two patients in saline group had nausea ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	None of our patients received any other oral or IV rescue medication .
CONCLUSIONS	Ultrasound TAP block can reduce postrenal transplantation pain and the amount of opioids consumption intraoperatively and during the first @ hours after surgery in kidney recipients .

BACKGROUND	Elevated symmetric dimethylarginine ( SDMA ) has been shown to predict cardiovascular events and all cause mortality in diverse populations .
BACKGROUND	The potential role of SDMA as a risk marker in renal transplant recipients ( RTR ) has not been investigated .
METHODS	We analyzed SDMA in the placebo arm of the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation study , a randomized controlled trial of fluvastatin in RTR .
METHODS	Mean follow-up was @ years .
METHODS	Patients were grouped into quartiles based on SDMA levels at study inclusion .
METHODS	Relationships between SDMA and traditional risk factors for graft function and all-cause mortality were analyzed in @ RTR using univariate and multivariate survival analyses .
RESULTS	In univariate analysis , SDMA was significantly associated with renal graft loss , all-cause death , and major cardiovascular events .
RESULTS	After adjustment for established risk factors including estimated glomerular filtration rate , an elevated SDMA-level ( @th quartile , > @ mol/L ) was associated with renal graft loss ; hazard ratio ( HR ) , @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) , @-@ @ ; P = @ , compared to the @st quartile .
RESULTS	Similarly , SDMA in the @th quartile was independently associated with all-cause mortality ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) , and there was a strong borderline significant trend for an association with cardiovascular mortality ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In stable RTR , an elevated SDMA level is independently associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and renal graft loss .

METHODS	The study was double-blind , pragmatic and cluster-randomised controlled .
METHODS	A total of @,@ patients ( age @-@ ) from @ general practitioners ( GPs ) were screened for MOH .
METHODS	GPs defined clusters and were randomised to receive BI training ( @ GPs ) or to continue business as usual ( BAU ; @ GPs ) .
METHODS	The Severity of Dependence Scale was applied as a part of the BI .
METHODS	BI involved feedback about individual risk of MOH and how to reduce overuse .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures were reduction in medication and headache days/month @ months after the intervention and were assessed by a blinded clinical investigator .
RESULTS	@ % responded to the postal screening questionnaire , and @ % screened positive for MOH .
RESULTS	A random selection of up to three patients with MOH from each GP were invited ( @ patients ) , @ patients were randomised and @ patients included into the study .
RESULTS	BI was significantly better than BAU for the primary outcomes ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Headache and medication days were reduced by @ and @ ( @ % CI @ to @ and @ to @ ) days/month in the BI compared with the BAU group .
RESULTS	Chronic headache resolved in @ % of the BI and @ % of the BAU group .
CONCLUSIONS	The BI method provides GPs with a simple and effective instrument that reduces medication-overuse and headache frequency in patients with MOH .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine both the value of gadolinium-enhanced MRI in children with suspected acute appendicitis and the best sequences for detecting acute appendicitis , to thereby decrease imaging time .
METHODS	This was a retrospective review of pediatric patients with suspected appendicitis who had undergone MRI at our institution between @ and @ after an indeterminate ultrasound examination .
METHODS	MRI examinations included T@-weighted unenhanced and contrast-enhanced , T@-weighted , and balanced steady-state free precession ( SSFP ) sequences in axial and coronal planes .
METHODS	Sequences were reviewed together and individually by five radiologists who were blinded to the final diagnosis .
METHODS	Radiologists were asked to score their confidence of appendicitis diagnosis using a @-point scale .
METHODS	The diagnostic performance of each MR sequence was obtained by comparing the mean area under the curve ( AUC ) using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) analysis .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were included , of whom @ received a diagnosis of appendicitis .
RESULTS	The mean AUCs for reviewing all sequences together , contrast-enhanced sequences alone , T@-weighted sequences alone , and balanced SSFP alone were @ , @ , @ , and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	No significant difference was observed between reviewing all sequences together versus contrast-enhanced sequences alone ( p = @ ) and T@-weighted sequences alone ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	A significant difference was observed between contrast-enhanced sequences and balanced SSFP ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Gadolinium-enhanced images and T@-weighted images are most helpful in the assessment of acute appendicitis in the pediatric population .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings have led to protocol modifications that have reduced imaging time .

BACKGROUND	There is an urgent need for more effective treatments for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .
BACKGROUND	As understanding of the cognitive and affective neuroscience underlying psychiatric disorders expands , so do opportunities to develop interventions that capitalize on the capacity for brain plasticity .
BACKGROUND	Cognitive training is one such strategy .
BACKGROUND	In this article , we report a proof-of-concept study of a novel cognitive-emotional training exercise designed to enhance cognitive control for emotional information processing and targeting components of the neural networks that have been implicated in MDD .
METHODS	Twenty-one participants with MDD in a current episode were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions : @ participating in a cognitive-emotional training paradigm ( emotional faces memory task ( EFMT ) ) involving eight sessions over @ weeks , and @ participating in an active control condition ( control training , CT ) .
METHODS	Assessments of MDD symptoms , negative affective bias in cognitive processing , and neurocognition ( attention and working memory ) were administered at baseline and after @ weeks .
RESULTS	Participants in the EFMT group exhibited a greater reduction in MDD symptoms compared to the CT group , and @ of the @ EFMT participants achieved clinical response ( @ % reduction in symptoms ) .
RESULTS	EFMT participants also exhibited changes in negative affective bias in the hypothesized direction whereas the CT participants did not .
RESULTS	Both groups exhibited similar , small improvements in attention and working memory .
CONCLUSIONS	Cognitive-emotional training may represent a feasible and effective intervention strategy for MDD .
CONCLUSIONS	This proof-of-concept study highlights the need for future studies to fully understand the effectiveness , and mechanisms of effect , of these training strategies .

BACKGROUND	Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) accounts for @ % of UK deaths .
BACKGROUND	It is associated with modifiable lifestyle factors , including insufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables ( F&V ) .
BACKGROUND	Lay health trainers ( LHTs ) offer practical support to help people develop healthier behaviour and lifestyles .
BACKGROUND	Our two-group pilot randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) investigated the effectiveness of LHTs at promoting a heart-healthy lifestyle among adults with at least one risk factor for CVD to inform a full-scale RCT .
METHODS	Eligible adults ( aged @-@ years ) , recruited from five practices serving deprived populations , were randomized to health information leaflets plus LHTs ' support for @ months ( n = @ ) versus health information leaflets alone ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	We recruited @ participants , with @ % completing @ month follow-up .
RESULTS	Both groups increased their self-reported F&V consumption and we found no evidence for LHTs ' support having significant added impact .
RESULTS	Most participants were relatively less deprived , as were the LHTs we were able to recruit and train .
CONCLUSIONS	Our pilot demonstrated that an LHT 's RCT whilst feasible faces considerable challenges .
CONCLUSIONS	However , to justify growing investment in LHTs , any behaviour changes and sustained impact on those at greatest need should be demonstrated in an independently evaluated , robust , fully powered RCT .

BACKGROUND	Although colonoscopy is the standard procedure in the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia , a significant number of clinical relevant lesions may be missed even by experienced endoscopists using current technology .
BACKGROUND	A transparent cap mounted at the tip of a colonoscope may be an easy way to extend the visual field during colonoscopy and may improve the detection rate of mucosal lesions .
METHODS	The significance of cap assisted ( CAC ) vs. conventional colonoscopy ( CC ) on polyp detection rate was evaluated in a prospective randomized controlled trial in @ patients .
RESULTS	CC and CAC detected polyps in @ % and @ , not significantly different .
RESULTS	There was also no significant difference between CAC and CC according to age , sex , indication for colonoscopy , diverticulosis , sedation , bowel cleansing , withdrawal time , time/number of attempts to intubate the cecal walve , number , localization , size or histology of polyps , .
RESULTS	However , the time to reach the cecal floor and the overall time of colonoscopy were significantly lower for CAC ( @ minute ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CAC was without clinical impact on polyp detection rate or performance of colonoscopy .

OBJECTIVE	Although most intensive care unit ( ICU ) admissions originate in the emergency department ( ED ) , a substantial number of admissions arrive from hospital wards .
OBJECTIVE	Patients transferred from the hospital ward often share clinical characteristics with those admitted from the ED , but family expectations may differ .
OBJECTIVE	An understanding of the impact of ICU admission source on family perceptions of end-of-life care may help improve patient and family outcomes by identifying those at risk for poor outcomes .
METHODS	This was a cohort study of patients with chronic illness and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation who died after admission to an ICU in any of the @ participating hospitals in the Seattle-Tacoma area between @ and @ ( n = @,@ ) .
METHODS	Using regression models adjusted for hospital site and patient - , nurse - and family-level characteristics , we examined associations between ICU admission source ( hospital ward vs. ED ) and ( @ ) family ratings of satisfaction with ICU care ; ( @ ) family and nurse ratings of quality of dying ; ( @ ) chart-based indicators of palliative care .
RESULTS	Admission from the hospital ward was associated with lower family ratings of quality of dying -LSB- -@ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ , -@ , p = @ -RSB- and satisfaction ( total score -@ , @ % CI -@ , -@ , p = @ ; satisfaction with care domain score -@ , @ % CI -@ , -@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Nurses did not report differences in quality of dying .
RESULTS	Patients from hospital wards were less likely to have family conferences -LSB- odds ratio ( OR ) @ , @ % CI @ , @ , p = @ -RSB- or discussion of prognosis in the first @ h after ICU admission ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ , p = @ ) but were more likely to receive spiritual care ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ , p = @ ) or have life support withdrawn ( OR @ , @ % CI @ , @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Admission from the hospital ward is associated with family perceptions of a lower quality of dying and less satisfaction with ICU care .
CONCLUSIONS	Differences in receipt of palliative care suggest that family of patients from the hospital ward receive less communication .
CONCLUSIONS	Nurse ratings of quality of dying did not significantly differ by ICU admission source , suggesting dissimilarities between family and nurse perspectives .
CONCLUSIONS	This study identifies a patient population at risk for poor quality palliative and end-of-life care .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies are needed to identify interventions to improve care for patients who deteriorate on the wards following hospital admission .

BACKGROUND	An important factor in the functional results after total knee arthroplasty is the achieved maximal flexion .
BACKGROUND	The main purpose of this study was to compare the maximal knee flexion one year after surgery in patients who received either the bicruciate substituting knee system or the conventional posterior stabilized system .
METHODS	In a prospective randomized controlled trial , @ patients presenting with osteoarthritis received the bicruciate substituting or the conventional posterior stabilized prosthesis .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the maximum flexion angle at one year postoperatively on a lateral radiograph made with the supine patient using manual force to bend the knee .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were active flexion ( lying and standing ) , the Knee Society Score , the Patella Scoring System score , the University of California Los Angeles score , the number and type of adverse device effects , and visual analog scale satisfaction up to two years postoperatively .
METHODS	The outcome measures of both groups were compared using one-sided t tests and non-parametric alternatives , with a significance level of p < @ .
RESULTS	No significant differences between the two groups were observed in maximal flexion on radiographs and in active flexion at baseline .
RESULTS	The median maximal flexion on radiographs was @ ( range , @ to @ ) for the bicruciate substituting group and @ ( range , @ to @ ) for the conventional posterior stabilized group .
RESULTS	The two groups showed comparable two-year results with respect to the Knee Society Score , the Patella Scoring System , the University of California Los Angeles score , and visual analog scale satisfaction .
RESULTS	In the bicruciate substituting group , forty-one adverse device effects in twenty-six patients were reported , including three total system revisions and fourteen manipulations under anesthesia , compared with the conventional posterior stabilized group , in which sixteen adverse device effects were observed in thirteen patients , including six manipulations under anesthesia ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients who receive a bicruciate substituting system compared with those who receive a conventional posterior stabilized system have comparable knee flexion characteristics and clinical and functional outcomes but more complications by two years after total knee arthroplasty .

BACKGROUND	Postural control associated with self-paced movement is critical for balance in frail older adults .
BACKGROUND	The present work aimed to investigate the effects of a @D virtual reality-based program on postural control associated with rapid arm movement in this population .
METHODS	Participants in an upright standing position performed rapid arm-raising movements towards a target .
METHODS	Practice-related changes were assessed by pre - and post-test comparisons of hand kinematics and centre-of-pressure ( CoP ) displacement parameters measured in a training group and a control group .
METHODS	During these pre - and post-test sessions , patients have to reach towards yellow balls appearing on the screen , form a standardized upright position ( with @cm between the two malleoli ) .
METHODS	Training group patients took part in six sessions of virtual game .
METHODS	In this , patients were asked to reach their arm towards yellow balls appearing on the screen , from an upright position .
RESULTS	After training , we observed improvements in arm movements and in the initial phase of CoP displacement , especially in the anticipatory postural adjustments .
RESULTS	Learning curves for these two types of motor improvements showed different rates .
RESULTS	These were continuous for the control of the arm movement , and discontinuous for the control of the CoP during the anticipatory postural adjustments .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that some level of motor ( re ) - learning is maintained in frail patients with low functional reserves .
CONCLUSIONS	They also suggest that re-learning of anticipatory postural control ( i.e. motor prediction ) is less robust than explicit motor learning involved for the arm reaching .
CONCLUSIONS	This last point should encourage clinicians to extend the training course duration , even if reaching movement improvements seems acquired , in order to automate these anticipatory postural activities .
CONCLUSIONS	However , other studies should be done to measure the retention of these two types of learning on a longer-term period .

BACKGROUND	The hippocampal volume is reduced in patients with major depression .
BACKGROUND	Exercise leads to an increased hippocampal volume in schizophrenia and in healthy old adults .
BACKGROUND	The effect of exercise on hippocampal volume is potentially mediated by brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and insulin like growth factor @ ( IGF-@ ) .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this trial was to assess the effect of an aerobic exercise intervention on hippocampal volume and serum BDNF , VEGF , and IGF-@ in patients with major depression .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to an aerobic exercise intervention ( n = @ ) or a control condition ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Both interventions consisted of three supervised sessions per week during a three months period .
RESULTS	Post-intervention the increase in maximal oxygen uptake was @ ml/kg/min ( SD @ ) in the aerobic exercise group and @ ml/kg/min ( SD @ ) in the control group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The hippocampal volume , BDNF , VEGF , or IGF-@ did not differ between the two groups .
RESULTS	Post-hoc we found a positive association between change in hippocampal volume and verbal memory ( Rho = @ ; p = @ ) and change in hippocampal volume and depressive symptoms ( Rho = @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Participation was low in both groups corresponding to an average participation of one session per week .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite a significant increase in maximal oxygen uptake , a pragmatic exercise intervention did not increase hippocampal volume or resting levels of neurotrophines in out-patients with mild to moderate major depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Trial identifier : ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	Intra-lesional bony overgrowth ( BO ) identified during or following cartilage repair treatment is being frequently described through subjective reports focusing primarily on incidence .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to quantify the exact volume of intra-lesional BO at @ months post-cartilage repair treatment , to determine if a correlation exists between the extent of BO and clinical outcomes , and to visualize and characterize the BO .
METHODS	MRI scans were systematically obtained during a randomized clinical trial for cartilage repair ( Stanish etal. , @ ) that compared two microfracture-based treatments in @ patients .
METHODS	Semi-automated morphological segmentation of pre-treatment , @ and @ months post-treatment scans utilizing a programmed anatomical atlas for all knee bone and cartilage structures permitted three-dimensional reconstruction , quantitative analysis , as well as qualitative characterization and artistic visualization ofBO .
RESULTS	Limited intra-lesional BO representing only @ % of the original debrided cartilage lesion volume was found in @ patients with available MRIs at @ months .
RESULTS	The majority ( @ % ) of patients had very little BO ( < @ % ) .
RESULTS	Most occurrences of BO carried either spotty ( @ % ) or planar ( @ % ) morphological features , and the remaining balance ( @ % ) was qualitatively unobservable by eye .
RESULTS	Pre-existing BO recurred at @ months in the same intra-lesional location in @ % of patients .
RESULTS	No statistical correlations were found between BO and clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Intra-lesional BO following microfracture-based treatments may not be as severe as previously believed , its incidence is partly explained by pre-existing conditions , and no relationship to clinical outcomes exists at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Morphologically , observable BO was categorized as comprising either spotty or planar bone .

BACKGROUND	Although physical exercise improves motor aspects of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , it is not clear whether it may also have a neuroprotective effect .
BACKGROUND	Objective .
BACKGROUND	In this @-year follow-up study , we determined whether intensive exercise in the early stages of the disease slows down PD progression .
METHODS	Forty newly diagnosed patients with PD were treated with rasagiline and randomly assigned to @ groups : MIRT Group ( two @-day multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatments -LSB- MIRT -RSB- , at @-year interval ) and Control Group ( only drug ) .
METHODS	In both groups , Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale Section II ( UPDRS II ) , UPDRS III , @-minute walking test ( @MWT ) , Timed Up-and-Go test ( TUG ) ; PD Disability Scale ( PDDS ) , and l-dopa equivalents were assessed at baseline ( T@ ) , @ months ( T@ ) , @ year ( T@ ) , @ months ( T@ ) , and @ years ( T@ ) later .
RESULTS	Over @ years , UPDRS II , UPDRS III , TUG , and PDDS differentially progressed in the @ groups : In the MIRT Group , all scores at T@ were better than at T@ ( all Ps < @ ) .
RESULTS	No changes were noted in the Control Group .
RESULTS	l-dopa equivalent dosages increased significantly only in the Control Group ( P = @ ) , with a decrease in the percentages of patients in monotherapy ( T@ @ % ; T@ , T@ , and T@ @ % ) .
RESULTS	In the MIRT Group , the percentages of such patients remained higher ( T@ and T@ @ % ; T@ @ % ; T@ @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that MIRT might slow down the progression of motor decay , it might delay the need for increasing drug treatment , and thus , it might have a neuroprotective effect .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the following four markers : vitamin B@ , selenium , vitamin D , and parvalbumin may be used as compliance markers for fish intake .
METHODS	Blood samples from a randomized cross-over herring intervention study ( n = @ ) were analysed by HPLC and immunochemistry .
METHODS	The criteria were that plasma or serum concentrations of candidate compliance markers after the herring diet should increase significantly compared to starting concentrations .
METHODS	In addition , the reference meat diet should not yield an increase in plasma concentration of the candidate marker .
RESULTS	Vitamin B@ and selenium met the set criteria for indicating a correlation between the marker and fish intake with significant increases in serum concentrations at @ % ( p = @ ) and @ % ( p = @ ) , respectively , after a @-week herring intervention ( @ meals a week ) .
RESULTS	Parvalbumin and @-hydroxy vitamin D@ levels did not increase significantly after the herring interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Vitamin B@ may be suitable as a compliance marker for fish intake .
CONCLUSIONS	Although selenium also met the criteria , the change in selenium serum concentrations was small compared to the change in vitamin B@ levels .

BACKGROUND	The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) is proposed to be a substitute for @-hour urinary protein ( @h-UP ) .
BACKGROUND	This study is aimed to determine whether the predictive accuracy of @h-UP using UPCR can be improved by simply multiplying estimated daily urine creatinine excretion ( eUCr ) and UPCR together .
METHODS	This study enrolled @ participants to investigate the correlation between spot UPCR and @h-UP .
METHODS	Three sets of spot urine samples were randomly collected throughout the day and night , along with the first morning void .
METHODS	UPCR was weighted by eUCr to investigate the improvement of accuracy in using spot urine samples to predict @h-UP .
RESULTS	There were strong correlation and concordance between UPCR and @h-UP irrespective of the time of spot urine sampling , and the correlation , concordance and agreement were improved after multiplying the UPCR value by the eUCr .
RESULTS	Greater improvement was found in the subgroups with measured daily urine creatinine excretion @ g/d and @ g/d .
CONCLUSIONS	This investigation demonstrated that multiplying UPCR by eUCr can improve the accuracy of only using UPCR to predict @h-UP .

BACKGROUND	Malignant pleural effusion is associated with short life expectancy and significant morbidity .
BACKGROUND	A randomized controlled trial comparing indwelling pleural catheters ( IPCs ) with talc pleurodesis found that IPCs reduced in-hospital time and the need for additional procedures but were associated with excess adverse events .
METHODS	Using data from the clinical trial , we compared costs associated with use of IPCs and with talc pleurodesis .
METHODS	Resource use and adverse events were captured through case report forms over the @-year trial follow-up .
METHODS	Costs for outpatient and inpatient visits , diagnostic imaging , nursing , and doctor time were obtained from the UK National Health Service reference costs and University of Kent 's Unit Costs of Health and Social Care @ and inflated to @ using the UK Consumer Price Index .
METHODS	Procedure supply costs were obtained from the manufacturer .
METHODS	Difference in mean costs was compared using nonparametric bootstrapping .
METHODS	All costs were converted to US dollars using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Purchasing Power Parity Index .
RESULTS	Overall mean cost ( SD ) for managing patients with IPCs and talc pleurodesis was $ @,@ ( $ @,@ ) and $ @,@ ( $ @,@ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The incremental mean cost difference was $ @ , with @ % CI of - $ @,@ to $ @,@ .
RESULTS	The mean cost related to ongoing drainage in the IPC group was $ @,@ ( $ @ ) vs $ @ ( $ @ ) in the talc pleurodesis group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This included the cost of drainage bottles , dressing changes in the first month , and catheter removal .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in cost of the initial intervention or adverse events between the groups .
RESULTS	For patients with survival < @ weeks , IPC is significantly less costly than talc pleurodesis , with mean cost difference of - $ @,@ ( @ % CI , - $ @,@ to - $ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no significant difference in the mean cost of managing patients with IPCs compared with talc pleurodesis .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with limited survival , IPC appears less costly .

OBJECTIVE	Erlotinib , N - ( @-ethynylphenyl ) -@,@ - bis ( @-methoxyethoxy ) quinazolin-@-amine is approved for the treatment for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer .
OBJECTIVE	Because erlotinib is metabolized predominately by CYP@A@ , co-administration of compounds that increase CYP@A@ activity may alter the efficacy and safety of erlotinib therapy .
OBJECTIVE	Two phase I studies were conducted in healthy male subjects to evaluate the effect of pre - or co-administered rifampicin , a CYP@A@ inducer , on the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib .
METHODS	Study @ included Groups A ( erlotinib @ mg days @ and @ , rifampicin @ mg days @-@ ) and B ( erlotinib @ mg days @ and @ ) in a parallel group study design .
METHODS	Study @ subjects received erlotinib @ mg day @ , erlotinib @ mg day @ , and rifampicin @ mg days @-@ .
METHODS	The primary endpoint in each study was the ratio of exposure ( AUC@ - and C max ) between days @ and @ .
METHODS	Urinary cortisol metabolic induction ratios were determined in Study @ for Group A subjects only .
RESULTS	In Study @ , the geometric mean ratios of AUC@ - and C max were @ and @ % , respectively , and the mean cortisol metabolic index increased from @ to @ , suggesting cytochrome P@ ( CYP ) enzyme induction .
RESULTS	In Study @ , the geometric mean ratios for AUC@ - and C max were @ and @ % ( when dose adjusted from @ to @ mg erlotinib ) , respectively , a greater relative decrease than observed in Study @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Erlotinib exposure ( AUC@ - and C max ) was reduced after pre - or concomitant dosing with rifampicin .
CONCLUSIONS	Doses of @ mg erlotinib may be necessary to compensate for concomitant medications with strong CYP@A@ enzyme induction effect .

BACKGROUND	Radiostereometric analysis provides highly precise measurements of component micromotion relative to the bone that is otherwise undetectable by routine radiographs .
BACKGROUND	This study compared , at a minimum of five years following surgery , the micromotion of tantalum and titanium acetabular cups and femoral head penetration in highly cross-linked polyethylene liners and conventional ( ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ) liners in active patients who had undergone total hip replacement .
METHODS	This institutional review board-approved prospective , randomized , blinded study involved forty-six patients .
METHODS	Patients were randomized into one of four cohorts according to both acetabular cup and polyethylene liner .
METHODS	Patients received either a cementless cup with a titanium mesh surface or a tantalum trabecular surface and either a highly cross-linked polyethylene liner or an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene liner .
METHODS	Radiostereometric analysis examinations and Short Form-@ Physical Component Summary , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) , University of California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) activity , and Harris hip scores were obtained preoperatively , postoperatively , at six months , and annually thereafter .
RESULTS	All patients had significant improvement ( p < @ ) in Short Form-@ Physical Component Summary , WOMAC , UCLA activity , and Harris hip scores postoperatively .
RESULTS	On radiostereometric analysis examination , highly cross-linked polyethylene liners showed significantly less median femoral head penetration at five years ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Steady-state wear rates from one year to five years were @ mm per year for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene liners and @ mm per year for highly cross-linked polyethylene liners .
RESULTS	At the five-year follow-up , the median migration ( and standard error ) was @ @ mm proximally for titanium cups and @ @ mm for tantalum cups .

BACKGROUND	Inactivity and sedentary behavior are related to poorer health outcomes in breast cancer survivors .
BACKGROUND	However , few studies examining these behaviors in survivors have used objective measures , considered activities other than moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity ( MVPA ) and/or sedentary behavior ( i.e. low intensity activities ) or compared survivors to healthy controls .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study is to compare accelerometer-measured activity of various intensities ( total , light , lifestyle , MVPA ) and sedentary behavior between breast cancer survivors and non-cancer controls .
METHODS	An imputation-based approach of independent sample t-tests adjusting for multiple comparisons was used to compare estimates of participation in each activity and sedentary behavior between survivors -LSB- n = @ ; M ( SD ) age = @ ( @ ) -RSB- and block-matched non-cancer controls -LSB- n = @ ; M ( SD ) age = @ ( @ ) -RSB- .
METHODS	Potential moderating effects of body mass index ( BMI ) , age , and education were also examined .
RESULTS	Breast cancer survivors registered less daily total ( @ v. @ ) light ( @ v. @ ) and lifestyle ( @ v. @ ) activity minutes and more MVPA ( @ v. @ ) and sedentary behavior ( @ v. @ ) minutes than controls ( p < @ for all ) .
RESULTS	These relationships were largely consistent across BMI , age and education .
RESULTS	On average , survivors spent an estimated @ % of their waking time sedentary and @ % in light/lifestyle activity and @ % in MVPA .
CONCLUSIONS	Breast cancer survivors are more sedentary and participate in less low intensity activity than controls .
CONCLUSIONS	Although survivors registered more MVPA , these levels were insufficient .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research should explore these differences and potential benefits of targeting low intensity activities and reducing sedentary time in this population .

BACKGROUND	Scarring represents a significant biomedical burden in clinical medicine .
BACKGROUND	Mechanomodulation has been linked to scarring through inflammation , but until now a systematic approach to attenuate mechanical force and reduce scarring has not been possible .
METHODS	The authors conducted a @-month , prospective , open-label , randomized , multicenter clinical trial to evaluate abdominoplasty scar appearance following postoperative treatment with the embrace Advanced Scar Therapy device to reduce mechanical forces on healing surgical incisions .
METHODS	Incisions from @ healthy adult subjects were randomized to receive embrace treatment on one half of an abdominoplasty incision and control treatment ( surgeon 's optimal care methods ) on the other half .
METHODS	The primary endpoint for this study was the difference between assessments of scar appearance for the treated and control sides using the visual analogue scale scar score .
RESULTS	Final @-month study photographs were obtained from @ subjects who completed at least @ weeks of dressing application .
RESULTS	The mean visual analogue scale score for embrace-treated scars ( @ ) was significantly improved compared with control-treated scars ( @ ) at @ months ( difference , @ ; @ percent confidence interval , @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both subjects and investigators found that embrace-treated scars demonstrated significant improvements in overall appearance at @ months using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale evaluation ( p = @ and p < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	These results demonstrate that the embrace device significantly reduces scarring following abdominoplasty surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	To the authors ' knowledge , this represents the first level I evidence for postoperative scar reduction .
METHODS	Therapeutic , II .

BACKGROUND	Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) requires patients to take an active role in their adherence to fluid restrictions .
BACKGROUND	Although fluid non-adherence had been identified among this patient group , no specific interventions have been researched or published with in the PD population .
BACKGROUND	The current study sought to investigate whether an applied cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT-based intervention ) used among haemodialysis patients would improve fluid adherence among PD patients ; utilizing clinical indicators used in practice .
METHODS	Fifteen PD patients identified as fluid non-adherent were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( IG ) or a deferred-entry control group ( CG ) .
METHODS	The study ran for a total of @ weeks , with five data collection points ; at baseline , post-intervention and at three follow-up points ; providing a RCT phase and a combined longitudinal analysis phase .
METHODS	The content of the group intervention encompassed educational , cognitive and behavioural components , aimed to assist patients ' self-management of fluid .
RESULTS	No significant differences in weight ( kg ) reduction were found in either phase and undesirable changes in blood pressure ( BP ) were observed .
RESULTS	However , in the longitudinal phase , a statistically significant difference in oedematous status was observed at @-week follow-up ; which may be indicative of fluid adherence .
RESULTS	Positive and significant differences were observed in the desired direction for measures of psychological well-being , quality of life and health beliefs ; areas correlated with enhanced fluid adherence in other research .
CONCLUSIONS	This study reveals encouraging and significant changes in predictors of fluid adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	Although there were no significant changes in weight as a crude clinical measure of fluid intake , significant reductions in oedematous status were observed as a consequence of this CBT-based group intervention .

BACKGROUND	This study compared palonosetron and ondansetron as rescue medications for postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) in patients who received prophylactic ondansetron .
BACKGROUND	Although guidelines recommend use of an agent from a different class when prophylaxis has failed , palonosetron has unique properties relative to other serotonin @-HT@ receptor antagonists .
BACKGROUND	Prior trials assessing its use for rescue have had conflicting results .
BACKGROUND	Although palonosetron has compared favorably with ondansetron for PONV prevention , the drugs have not been compared in the rescue setting of failure of @-HT@ receptor antagonist prophylaxis .
METHODS	This was a randomized , open-label , multicenter trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous palonosetron @ mg and intravenous ondansetron @mg in patients experiencing PONV following laparoscopic abdominal or gynecological surgery despite prophylactic ondansetron .
RESULTS	Of @ patients screened , @ were enrolled and @ were treated for PONV : @ and @ in the palonosetron and ondansetron arms , respectively .
RESULTS	Complete control during @hours after study drug administration was achieved in @ % of palonosetron recipients and @ % of ondansetron recipients ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ , @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Corresponding incidences of vomiting were @ % for palonosetron and @ % for ondansetron ( @ % CI , -@ , @ ; p = @ ) , and @ % and @ % required additional rescue treatment , respectively ( @ % CI , -@ , @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Other than a similar incidence of procedural pain in the @ groups , the most common treatment-emergent adverse events , which were generally mild , were headache ( @ % vs @ % ) , constipation ( @ % vs @ % ) , and dizziness ( @ % vs @ % ) , for the palonosetron and ondansetron groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Palonosetron and ondansetron did not show differences in the primary efficacy endpoint of CC during the @hours after study drug administration .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a trend toward less emesis in the @-@h time period favoring palonosetron .
CONCLUSIONS	While larger studies are needed to fully assess any clinical benefits of palonosetron to rescue patients who have failed ondansetron prophylaxis for PONV , the benefit , if any , would be limited based on this study .

BACKGROUND	Current methods of the transtibial pull-out meniscal root repair significantly displace under cyclic loading in porcine models but have not been evaluated in human models .
BACKGROUND	One potential explanation for the displacement is that a single transtibial tunnel may not fully restore the attachment of the entire posterior medial meniscal root .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to biomechanically evaluate the transtibial pull-out technique in a human cadaveric model using either @ or @ transtibial bone tunnels .
OBJECTIVE	The hypothesis was that a transtibial pull-out technique using @ transtibial bone tunnels would confer superior biomechanical properties in comparison to an iteration using @ transtibial bone tunnel .
METHODS	Controlled laboratory study .
METHODS	Ten matched pairs of male human cadaveric knees ( average age , @ years ) were randomly assigned ( @ each of the pair ) to @ groups consisting of a transtibial pull-out technique using either @ or @ transtibial bone tunnels .
METHODS	The knees were cyclically loaded for @ cycles from @ to @ N at @ Hz , representing the loads experienced during a typical meniscal root repair postoperative rehabilitation program , and then pulled to failure at a rate of @ mm/s .
RESULTS	Differences between @ - and @-tunnel repair groups were neither statistically nor clinically significant with respect to displacement or ultimate failure load .
RESULTS	On average , the @ - and @-tunnel repair groups resulted in @ mm and @ mm of displacement , respectively , after @ testing cycles .
RESULTS	At @ , @ , @ , and @ testing cycles , displacement was not significantly different between groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-tunnel repair technique resulted in a @ % higher ultimate failure load ( @ N vs. @ N ) ; however , this was not significant ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Similar biomechanical properties were seen between transtibial pull-out repairs using either @ or @ transtibial bone tunnels in a human cadaveric model .
CONCLUSIONS	Both repair groups exceeded the @-mm threshold for nonanatomic displacement .
CONCLUSIONS	This study indicates that a newly proposed iteration of the transtibial pull-out repair technique using a second transtibial tunnel , which theoretically restores more of the posterior medial meniscal root , was almost identical to the current clinical standard involving a single transtibial tunnel .
CONCLUSIONS	As the importance of repairing meniscal root tears is increasingly recognized , further studies on new iterations of both techniques are warranted to minimize the risk of displacement caused by early motion in the initial postoperative rehabilitation period .

BACKGROUND	Several evidence-based treatments are available to veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
BACKGROUND	However , not all veterans benefit from these treatments or prefer to engage in them .
OBJECTIVE	The current study explored whether ( @ ) a mantram repetition program ( MRP ) increased mindful attention among veterans with PTSD , ( @ ) mindful attention mediated reduced PTSD symptom severity and enhanced psychological well-being , and ( @ ) improvement in mindful attention was due to the frequency of mantram repetition practice .
METHODS	Data from a randomized controlled trial comparing MRP plus treatment as usual ( MRP+TAU ) or TAU were analyzed using hierarchical linear models .
METHODS	A total of @ veterans with PTSD from military-related trauma were recruited from a Veterans Affairs outpatient PTSD clinic ( @ MRP+TAU ; @ TAU ) .
METHODS	The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , PTSD Checklist ( PCL ) , the Brief Symptom Inventory-@ depression subscale , Health Survey SF-@v@ , and Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale ( MAAS ) were used .
METHODS	Frequency of mantram repetition practice was measured using wrist-worn counters and daily logs .
RESULTS	Intent-to-treat analyses indicated greater increases in mindful attention , as measured by the MAAS , for MRP+TAU as compared with TAU participants ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Mindful attention gains mediated previously reported treatment effects on reduced PTSD symptoms ( using both CAPS and PCL ) , reduced depression , and improved psychological well-being .
RESULTS	Frequency of mantram repetition practice in turn mediated increased mindful attention .
CONCLUSIONS	The MRP intervention and specifically , mantram practice , improved mindful attention in veterans with PTSD , yielding improved overall psychological well-being .
CONCLUSIONS	MRP may be a beneficial adjunct to usual care in veterans with PTSD .

METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ , and NCT@ for the follow-up after @ weeks .
RESULTS	We enrolled patients between April @ , @ , and March @ , @ .
RESULTS	In phase @ , @ patients were enrolled to six sequential cohorts of three to six patients and received a daily dose of ODM-@ , @-@ mg .
RESULTS	No dose-limiting toxic effects were reported and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached .
RESULTS	In phase @ , three patients reported eight adverse events of grade @ ( fracture , muscle injury , laceration , paralytic ileus , pain , presyncope , urinary retention , and vomiting ) and one patient had a grade @ adverse event ( lymphoedema ) .
RESULTS	None of the grade @-@ adverse events were deemed to be related to ODM-@ .
RESULTS	Of the phase @ patients , the four who received @ mg , seven who received @ mg , and three who received @ mg entered the phase @ part of the trial .
RESULTS	In addition to these patients , @ were randomly assigned to three groups : @ mg ( n = @ ) , @ mg ( n = @ ) , and @ mg ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	For these patients , the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue or asthenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients ) , hot flush ( six -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , and decreased appetite ( five -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	One patient ( < @ % ) had a grade @ treatment-emergent adverse event ( fatigue ) ; no patients had a treatment-emergent grade @ adverse event .

BACKGROUND	The United Kingdom Employment Retention and Advancement ( U.K. ERA ) demonstration was the largest and most comprehensive social experiment ever conducted in the United Kingdom .
BACKGROUND	It examined the extent to which a combination of postemployment advisory support and financial incentives could help lone parents on welfare to find sustained employment with prospects for advancement .
BACKGROUND	ERA was experimentally tested across more than @ public employment service offices and , within each office , individuals were randomly assigned to either a program ( or treatment ) group ( eligible for ERA ) or a control group ( not eligible ) .
METHODS	This article presents the results of a multilevel nonexperimental analysis that examines the variation in office-level impacts and attempts to understand what services provided in the offices tend to be associated with impacts .
RESULTS	The analysis suggests that impacts were greater in offices that emphasized in-work advancement , support while working and financial bonuses for sustained employment , and also in those offices that assigned more caseworkers to ERA participants .
RESULTS	Offices that encouraged further education had smaller employment impacts .
CONCLUSIONS	Plausible results are obtained identifying those particular implementation features that tended to be linked to stronger impacts of ERA .
CONCLUSIONS	The methodology employed also allows the identification of which services are associated with employment and welfare receipt of control families receiving benefits under the traditional New Deal for Lone Parent program .

BACKGROUND	Minimally invasive surgeries of the soft palate have emerged as a less-invasive treatment for habitual snoring .
BACKGROUND	To date , there is only limited information available comparing the effects of snoring sound between different minimally invasive surgeries in the treatment of habitual snoring .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of palatal implant and radiofrequency surgery , in the reduction of snoring through subjective evaluation of snoring and objective snoring sound analysis .
METHODS	Thirty patients with habitual snoring due to palatal obstruction ( apnea-hypopnea index @ , body max index @ ) were prospectively enrolled and randomized to undergo a single session of palatal implant or temperature-controlled radiofrequency surgery of the soft palate under local anesthesia .
METHODS	Snoring was primarily evaluated by the patient with a @ cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) at baseline and at a @-month follow-up visit and the change in VAS was the primary outcome .
METHODS	Moreover , life qualities , measured by snore outcomes survey , and full-night snoring sounds , analyzed by a sound analytic program ( Snore Map ) , were also investigated at the same time .
RESULTS	Twenty-eight patients completed the study ; @ received palatal implant surgery and @ underwent radiofrequency surgery .
RESULTS	The VAS and snore outcomes survey scores were significantly improved in both groups .
RESULTS	However , the good response ( postoperative VAS @ or postoperative VAS @ plus snore outcomes survey score @ ) rate of the palatal implant group was significantly higher than that of the radiofrequency group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The maximal loudness of low-frequency ( @-@ Hz ) snores was reduced significantly in the palatal implant group .
RESULTS	In addition , the snoring index was significantly reduced in the radiofrequency group .
CONCLUSIONS	Both palatal implants and a single-stage radiofrequency surgery improve subjective snoring outcomes , but palatal implants have a greater effect on most measures of subjective and objective snoring .
CONCLUSIONS	Multi-stage radiofrequency surgery was not tested .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether a maneuver for repeated cycles of collapse and reexpansion of the operative lung , termed `` intermittent reinflation '' ( IR ) , to counter hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) , results in a time-dependent alteration of extravascular lung water .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized clinical study .
METHODS	Operating room and postsurgical intensive care unit of a university hospital .
METHODS	@ ASA physical status @ and @ patients undergoing elective , video-assisted thoracic surgery for lung tumors .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to two groups .
METHODS	Group C consisted of @ patients whose nondependent lung was kept collapsed during OLV , while Group IR included @ patients with IR that consisted of @ separate , @-second manual inflations and @-second openings within one minute at intervals of @ minutes during OLV .
METHODS	Perioperative parameters included transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( SpO@ ) , hemodynamic data , extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) , pulmonary vascular permeability index ( PVPI ) as determined by the single-indicator transpulmonary thermodilution technique , and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction ( PaO@/FIO@ ) ratio .
RESULTS	Group IR had significantly higher SpO@ at @ minutes after commencement of OLV ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and average SpO@ throughout OLV ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hemodynamic data , EVLWI , PVPI , and PaO@/FIO@ ratio did not differ between the groups , and there were no differences between groups in postoperative morbidity or hospital stay .
CONCLUSIONS	Intermittent reinflation had a beneficial effect on oxygenation during OLV , without any significant effects on EVLW or postoperative outcomes .

METHODS	Patients with Morquio A syndrome aged @ years were randomized @:@:@ to elosulfase alfa @ mg/kg/week ( qw ; N = @ ) , elosulfase alfa @ mg/kg/every other week ( qow ; N = @ ) , or placebo ( N = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Primary and secondary efficacy measures were @-minute walk test ( @MWT ; primary ) , @-minute stair climb test ( @-MSCT ) and urinary keratan sulfate ( KS ) .
METHODS	Safety was also evaluated .
METHODS	Tertiary efficacy measures included respiratory function measures , activities of daily living ( MPS Health Assessment Questionnaire -LSB- MPS-HAQ -RSB- ) , anthropometric , echocardiographic and radiographic measures , hearing and corneal clouding assessment .
METHODS	In order to fully characterize treatment impact in this heterogeneous disorder , the effect of elosulfase alfa on composite efficacy measures was evaluated as well .
RESULTS	The study was not designed to have sufficient power for any of the tertiary outcomes .
RESULTS	For most tertiary endpoints , subjects treated with the weekly dose of elosulfase alfa improved more than those receiving placebo .
RESULTS	The largest treatment effects were seen in maximal voluntary ventilation ( MVV ) , MPS-HAQ , height , and growth rate .
RESULTS	The qow group appeared similar to placebo .
RESULTS	The analysis of a pre-specified composite endpoint ( combining changes from baseline in @MWT , @MSCT and MVV z-scores equally weighted ) showed a modest positive impact of elosulfase alfa qw versus placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	As a pre-specified supportive analysis , the O'Brien Rank Sum composite endpoint ( changes from baseline in @MWT , @MSC , and MVV ) , analysis also showed that the qw group performed better than the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In post-hoc analyses , combinations of other endpoints were also explored using the O'Brien Rank Sum test and showed statistically significant differences between elosulfase alfa qw and placebo favoring elosulfase alfa qw .
RESULTS	Differences between elosulfase alfa qow and placebo were not statistically significant .
RESULTS	Positive changes were observed in most tertiary variables , demonstrating the efficacy of weekly treatment with elosulfase alfa .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with weekly elosulfase alfa led to improvements across most efficacy measures , resulting in clinically meaningful benefits in a heterogeneous study population .

BACKGROUND	Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide .
BACKGROUND	Oxidative stress has been involved in the ischemia-reperfusion injury in AMI .
BACKGROUND	It has been suggested that reperfusion accounts for up to @ % of the final size of a myocardial infarct , a part of the damage likely to be prevented.Therefore , we propose that antioxidant reinforcement through vitamins C and E supplementation should protect against the ischemia-reperfusion damage , thus decreasing infarct size.The PREVEC Trial ( Prevention of reperfusion damage associated with percutaneous coronary angioplasty following acute myocardial infarction ) seeks to evaluate whether antioxidant vitamins C and E reduce infarct size in patients subjected to percutaneous coronary angioplasty after AMI .
METHODS	This is a randomized , @:@ , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial.The study takes place at two centers in Chile : University of Chile Clinical Hospital and San Borja Arriarn Clinical Hospital.The subjects will be @ adults with acute myocardial infarction with indication for percutaneous coronary angioplasty.This intervention is being performed as a pilot study , involving high-dose vitamin C infusion plus oral administration of vitamin E ( Vitamin-treatment group ) or placebo ( Control group ) during the angioplasty procedure .
METHODS	Afterward , the Vitamin-treatment group receives oral doses of vitamins C and E , and the Control group receives placebo for @ days after coronary angioplasty.Primary outcome is infarct size , assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) , measured @ and @ days after coronary angioplasty.Secondary outcomes are ejection fraction , measured @ and @ days after coronary angioplasty with CMR , and biomarkers for oxidative stress , antioxidant status , heart damage , and inflammation , which will be measured at baseline , at the onset of reperfusion , @ to @ hours after revascularization , and at hospital discharge .
CONCLUSIONS	The ischemia-reperfusion event occurring during angioplasty is known to increase myocardial infarct size .
CONCLUSIONS	The cardioprotective benefits of high doses of vitamin C combined with vitamin E have not been fully explored .
CONCLUSIONS	The PREVEC Trial seeks to determine the suitability of the therapeutic use of vitamins C and E against the reperfusion damage produced during angioplasty.Patient recruitment opened in February @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The trial is scheduled to end in March @ .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the effects of early intervention of acupuncture on urinary function reconstruction of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury , so as to find the optimal treatment timing of acupuncture .
METHODS	Fifty-three patients of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury were randomly divided into a prior-to-catheter group ( @ cases ) and a posterior-to-catheter group ( @ cases ) .
METHODS	For the prior-to-catheter group , one week before the removal of catheter , acupoints on the abdomen and back such as Guanyuan ( CV @ ) , Zhongji ( CV @ ) , Baliao ( Shangliao ( BL @ ) , Ciliao ( BL @ ) , Zhongliao ( BL @ ) , Xialiao ( BL @ ) , Jiaji ( EX-B @ ) and acupoints at distal end such as Zusanli ( ST @ ) and Sanyinjiao ( SP @ ) were selected ; after the catheter removal , simple method .
METHODS	of water column was used to measure bladder capacity pressure to classify the type of bladder , and then different acupuncture manipulations were given ; intermittent catheterization was performed if condition was allowed .
METHODS	The posterior-to-catheter group applied identical treatment after removal of catheter as the prior-to-catheter group .
METHODS	The treatment was given @ times per week ; after one-month treatment , five aspects including the time of first effective urination , time of establishing reflex urination , average residual volume of urine , time of residual urine less than @ mL and quality of life ( QOL ) were evaluated .
RESULTS	After treatment , the time of first effective urination , time of establishing reflex urination , average residual volume of urine and time of residual urineless than @ mL in the prior-to-catheter group were all superior to those in the posterior-to-catheter group ( all P < @ ) ; the score of QOL was improved in two groups after treatment ( both P < @ ) , but the difference between two groups was not statistically significant ( P > @ ) ; each index of urination function was not significant among patients with different injured segments of spinal cord ( all P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The early intervention of acupuncture ( prior to catheter ) has obvious improving function on establishing balanced bladder in patients with neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury , which is superior to acupuncture intervention after removal of catheter , however , the effects of different injured segments on establishing balanced bladder are not different .

BACKGROUND	Idrabiotaparinux , a long-acting inhibitor of factor Xa , was shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism .
OBJECTIVE	To assess non-inferiority for the efficacy of idrabiotaparinux versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) at risk of stroke and systemic embolism .
OBJECTIVE	Bleeding was also assessed .
METHODS	This randomized , double-blind trial enrolled patients with electrocardiogram-documented AF .
METHODS	Idrabiotaparinux was administered weekly via subcutaneous injection , and warfarin was administered daily with dose adjustment to maintain the international normalized ratio between @ and @ .
METHODS	Each idrabiotaparinux injection was @ mg for the first @ weeks , followed by @ mg thereafter , except in patients with a creatinine clearance of @-@ mL min ( -@ ) or aged @ years .
METHODS	The patients received @ mg after the first @ weeks .
METHODS	The efficacy outcome was the composite of all fatal or non-fatal strokes and systemic embolism .
METHODS	The safety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding ( major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding ) .
RESULTS	The study was terminated prematurely by the sponsor for strategic/commercial , not scientific , reasons , with @ % of the planned number of patients included and an average duration of treatment of @ days .
RESULTS	Of the @ idrabiotaparinux recipients , @ developed stroke or systemic embolism ( @ % per year ) , whereas this occurred in @ of the @ warfarin patients ( @ % per year , hazard ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The annual incidence of bleeding was @ % in the idrabiotaparinux and @ % in the warfarin group ( hazard ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	If anything , despite its early termination , the idrabiotaparinux regimen studied suggested a comparable efficacy to dose-adjusted warfarin , with a lower bleeding risk .

BACKGROUND	Low rates of adherence to artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) regimens increase the risk of treatment failure and may lead to drug resistance , threatening the sustainability of current anti-malarial efforts .
BACKGROUND	We assessed the impact of text message reminders on adherence to ACT regimens .
METHODS	Health workers at hospitals , clinics , pharmacies , and other stationary ACT distributors in Tamale , Ghana provided flyers advertising free mobile health information to individuals receiving malaria treatment .
METHODS	The messaging system automatically randomized self-enrolled individuals to the control group or the treatment group with equal probability ; those in the treatment group were further randomly assigned to receive a simple text message reminder or the simple reminder plus an additional statement about adherence in @-hour intervals .
METHODS	The main outcome was self-reported adherence based on follow-up interviews occurring three days after treatment initiation .
METHODS	We estimated the impact of the messages on treatment completion using logistic regression .
RESULTS	@ individuals enrolled in both the study and the text reminder system .
RESULTS	Among individuals in the control group , @ % took the full course of treatment .
RESULTS	The simple text message reminders increased the odds of adherence ( adjusted OR @ , @ % CI -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- , p-value @ ) .
RESULTS	Receiving an additional message did not result in a significant change in adherence ( adjusted OR @ , @ % CI -LSB- @ to @ -RSB- , p-value @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that a simple text message reminder can increase adherence to antimalarial treatment and that additional information included in messages does not have a significant impact on completion of ACT treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to develop the most effective text message content and frequency .

METHODS	Children performed perimetric assessments in a randomized order using Goldmann and Octopus kinetic perimetry , and Humphrey static perimetry ( Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm -LSB- SITA -RSB- @-@ FAST ) , in a single sitting , using standardized clinical protocols , with assessment by a single examiner .
METHODS	Unreliable results ( assessed qualitatively ) were excluded from the normative data analysis .
METHODS	Linear , piecewise , and quantile mixed-effects regression models were used .
METHODS	We developed a method to display age-specific normative isopters graphically on a VF plot to aid interpretation .
METHODS	Summary measures and graphical plots describing normative VF data for @ common perimetric tests .
RESULTS	Visual field area increased with age on testing with Goldmann isopters III@e , I@e , and I@e ( linear regression ; P < @ ) and for Octopus isopters III@e and I@e ( linear regression ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Visual field development occurs predominately in the inferotemporal field .
RESULTS	Humphrey mean deviation ( MD ) showed an increase of @ decibels ( dB ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) MD per year up to @ years of age , when adult MD values were reached and thereafter maintained .
CONCLUSIONS	Visual field size and sensitivity increase with age in patterns that are specific to the perimetric approach used .
CONCLUSIONS	These developmental changes should be accounted for when interpreting perimetric test results in children , particularly when monitoring change over time .

BACKGROUND	Guidelines for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) traditionally recommend a fixed tracer dose .
BACKGROUND	Yet , clinical practice shows degraded image quality in heavier patients .
BACKGROUND	The aim was to optimize and validate the tracer dose and scan time to obtain a constant image quality less dependent on patients ' physical characteristics .
METHODS	@ patients underwent Cadmium Zinc Telluride ( CZT ) - SPECT stress MPI using a fixed Tc-@m-tetrofosmin tracer dose .
METHODS	Image quality was scored by three physicians on a @-point grading scale and related to the number of photon counts normalized to tracer dose and scan time .
METHODS	Counts were correlated with various patient-specific parameters dealing with patient size and weight to find the best predicting parameter .
METHODS	From these data , a formula to provide constant image quality was derived , and subsequently tested in @ new patients .
RESULTS	Degradation in image quality and photon counts was observed for heavier patients for all patients ' specific parameters ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	We found body weight to be the best-predicting parameter for image quality and derived a new dose formula .
RESULTS	After applying this new body weight-depended tracer dose and scan time in a new group , image quality was found to be constant ( P > @ ) in all patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Also in CZT SPECT image quality decreases with weight .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a tracer dose and scan time that depends linearly on patient 's body weight corrected for the varying image quality in CZT-SPECT MPI .
CONCLUSIONS	This leads to better radiation exposure justification .

BACKGROUND	No randomised study has shown whether stratification of treatment by minimal residual disease ( MRD ) response improves outcome in children and young people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) .
BACKGROUND	We assessed whether children and young people with clinical standard and intermediate-risk ALL who have persistent MRD at the end of induction therapy benefit from augmented post-remission therapy .
METHODS	Between Oct @ , @ , and June @ , @ , we enrolled eligible patients aged @-@ years and initially categorised them into clinical standard-risk , intermediate-risk , and high-risk groups on the basis of a combination of National Cancer Institute criteria , cytogenetics , and early morphological response to induction therapy .
METHODS	Clinical standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with MRD of @ % or higher at day @ of induction ( MRD high risk ) were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to standard therapy ( treatment regimens A and B ) or augmented post-remission therapy ( regimen C ) .
METHODS	Compared with standard therapy , the augmented treatment regimen ( regimen C ) included an additional eight doses of pegylated asparaginase , @ doses of vincristine , and escalated-dose intravenous methotrexate without folinic acid rescue during interim maintenance courses .
METHODS	Computer randomisation was used for treatment allocation and was balanced for sex , age ( < @ years vs @ years ) , and white blood cell count at diagnosis ( < @ ( @ ) / L vs @ ( @ ) / L ) by minimisation .
METHODS	Patients , clinicians , and data analysts were not masked to treatment allocation .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were event-free survival and overall survival .
METHODS	Analyses were by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	@ MRD high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive standard ( n = @ ) or augmented ( n = @ ) post-remission therapy .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , @-year event-free survival was better in the augmented treatment group ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) than in the standard group ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall survival at @ years was numerically , but not significantly , higher in the augmented treatment group ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) than in the standard therapy group ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; OR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	More adverse events occurred in the augmented treatment group than in the standard group ( asparaginase-related hypersensitivity in @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the augmented group vs two -LSB- @ % -RSB- in the standard group and asparaginase-related pancreatitis in eight -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs one -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; intravenous methotrexate-related mucositis in @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs three -LSB- @ % -RSB- and methotrexate-related stomatitis in @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that children and young people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and @ % or more MRD at the end of remission induction therapy could benefit from augmented post-remission therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the asparaginase and intravenous methotrexate used in the augmented treatment regimen is associated with more adverse events than is the standard post-remission treatment regimen .

BACKGROUND	Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer ( HNC ) .
BACKGROUND	However , individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms .
BACKGROUND	Elaborate tumor characterization , integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties , may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes .
BACKGROUND	The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical ( IHC ) assessment of molecular markers , involved in treatment resistance , and @F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors .
METHODS	Several imaging parameters and texture features for @F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism , hypoxia , proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with @ human HNC models .
METHODS	Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters .
RESULTS	We found that @F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines .
RESULTS	On the contrary , combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model .
RESULTS	From @ analyzed IHC parameters , a cluster of @ random parameters already classified @ % correctly .
RESULTS	Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy ( @ % ; cross validation @ % ) , which was just @ % higher ( p = @-@ ) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model .
CONCLUSIONS	With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism , proliferation , hypoxia and perfusion , one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of @F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree .
CONCLUSIONS	These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes .

BACKGROUND	The EACH study assessed the efficacy of oxaliplatin , @-fluorouracil , and leucovorin ( the FOLFOX@ regimen ) compared with doxorubicin alone in terms of overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , and safety in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .
BACKGROUND	We present the results of this study in Chinese patients .
METHODS	In a multicenter , open-label , randomized , phase III study ( NCT@ ) , @ patients ( @ patients from the People 's Republic of China ) were randomized @:@ to receive either FOLFOX@ or doxorubicin until disease progression , intolerable toxicity , death , or surgical resection .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics of the Chinese patients enrolled in the study were similar for the @ treatment groups and in comparison with the whole EACH cohort .
RESULTS	Median OS at the prespecified time point of treatment was @ months with FOLFOX@ and @ months with doxorubicin ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- :@ -@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At the end of the follow-up period , median OS was @ months with FOLFOX@ and @ months with doxorubicin ( HR : @ ; @ % CI :@ -@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median PFS was @ months and @ months in the FOLFOX@ and doxorubicin groups , respectively ( HR : @ ; @ % CI :@ -@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The response rate ( RR ) and disease control rate ( DCR ) were significantly higher in the FOLFOX@ group than in the doxorubicin group ( RR : @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ; DCR : @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hematological toxicity was more frequently reported in the FOLFOX@ group .
CONCLUSIONS	For Chinese HCC patients enrolled in the EACH study , FOLFOX@ significantly improved the RR and DCR and prolonged survival compared with doxorubicin .
CONCLUSIONS	Systemic chemotherapy with oxaliplatin-based regimens may play an important role in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced HCC .

OBJECTIVE	Children are vulnerable to diet inadequacies , which may affect immune function .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to determine if a follow-up formula ( FUF ) containing DHA , the prebiotics PDX and GOS , and yeast - glucan affects incidence of respiratory infections and diarrheal disease in healthy children .
METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , controlled , prospective trial , @-@ year old children were fed @ servings per day of either a FUF with @ mg DHA , @ g PDX/GOS , and @ mg yeast - glucan per serving or an unfortified , cow 's milk-based beverage ( control ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Fecal and blood samples were collected to assess immune markers and iron/zinc status .
METHODS	Incidence of acute respiratory infections ( ARI ) , diarrheal disease , and antibiotic treatment were obtained from medical records .
RESULTS	The FUF group had fewer episodes and shorter duration of ARI ( mean days -LSB- SE -RSB- ; control = @ -LSB- @ -RSB- ; FUF = @ -LSB- @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) , less antibiotic use ( n -LSB- % -RSB- ; control = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; FUF = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) , and fewer missed days of day care due to illness .
RESULTS	No diarrheal disease was diagnosed in either group .
RESULTS	The FUF group had higher interleukin-@ and white blood cell count at the end of the study .
RESULTS	There were no differences in hemoglobin , serum ferritin and zinc , or fecal secretory immunoglobulin A.
CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of a FUF was associated with fewer episodes and shorter duration of ARI , as well as less antibiotic use .
CONCLUSIONS	The children who consumed the FUF had increased interleukin-@ and white blood cells , suggesting an antiinflammatory mechanism and/or an increase of effector immune cells .

BACKGROUND	In the PROTECT AF ( Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation ) trial that evaluated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF ) , left atrial appendage ( LAA ) occlusion was noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention , but a periprocedural safety hazard was identified .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of LAA occlusion for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF compared with long-term warfarin therapy .
METHODS	This randomized trial further assessed the efficacy and safety of the Watchman device .
METHODS	Patients with NVAF who had a CHADS@ ( congestive heart failure , hypertension , age > @ years , diabetes mellitus , and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack ) score @ or @ and another risk factor were eligible .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( in a @:@ ratio ) to undergo LAA occlusion and subsequent discontinuation of warfarin ( intervention group , n = @ ) or receive chronic warfarin therapy ( control group , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Two efficacy and @ safety coprimary endpoints were assessed .
RESULTS	At @ months , the rate of the first coprimary efficacy endpoint ( composite of stroke , systemic embolism -LSB- SE -RSB- , and cardiovascular/unexplained death ) was @ in the device group versus @ in the control group ( rate ratio @ -LSB- @ % credible interval ( CrI ) : @ to @ -RSB- ) and did not achieve the prespecified criteria noninferiority ( upper boundary of @ % CrI @ ) .
RESULTS	The rate for the second coprimary efficacy endpoint ( stroke or SE > @ days ' postrandomization ) was @ versus @ ( risk difference @ -LSB- @ % CrI : -@ to @ -RSB- ) , achieving noninferiority .
RESULTS	Early safety events occurred in @ % of the Watchman arm , significantly lower than in PROTECT AF , satisfying the pre-specified safety performance goal .
RESULTS	Using a broader , more inclusive definition of adverse effects , these still were lower in PREVAIL ( Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy ) trial than in PROTECT AF ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pericardial effusions requiring surgical repair decreased from @ % to @ % ( p = @ ) , and those requiring pericardiocentesis decreased from @ % to @ % ( p = @ ) , although the number of events was small .
CONCLUSIONS	In this trial , LAA occlusion was noninferior to warfarin for ischemic stroke prevention or SE > @ days ' post-procedure .
CONCLUSIONS	Although noninferiority was not achieved for overall efficacy , event rates were low and numerically comparable in both arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Procedural safety has significantly improved .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial provides additional data that LAA occlusion is a reasonable alternative to warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF who do not have an absolute contraindication to short-term warfarin therapy .

BACKGROUND	Therapeutic vaccination is a promising novel approach to treat HIV-@ infected people by boosting or redirecting immune system to neutralize critical HIV-@ antigens whose biological effects are relevant in the context of viral pathogenesis .
BACKGROUND	With the aim to induce neutralizing antibodies to the matrix protein p@ we have developed a peptide-based immunogen ( AT@-KLH ) and evaluated its safety and immunogenicity .
METHODS	Twenty four asymptomatic HAART-treated HIV-@ + patients were enrolled in a phase I clinical study and were randomized to three groups : @ groups were treated with five IM injection ( Arm A : @g/inoculation ; Arm B : @g/inoculation ) at day ( D ) D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ and D@ ; the control group ( Arm C ) were not injected .
METHODS	Safety was assessed by monitoring local and systemic adverse events ( AEs ) , recorded till D@ .
METHODS	Evaluation of immunogenicity was by titering antibodies at D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ , D@ and D@ using ELISA .
RESULTS	In all , @ local and systemic AEs were reported across the three groups .
RESULTS	Most were mild and resolved without sequelae .
RESULTS	Also the few unsolicited events , deemed unrelated to the study vaccines , caused no problems .
RESULTS	No significant changes in the routine laboratory parameters , CD@ T-cell count or HIV-@ viremia were found .
RESULTS	At the time of enrollment @ out of @ patients had no anti-AT@ antibodies , whereas @ exhibited anti-p@ antibodies .
RESULTS	Irrespective of the presence of preimmunization antibodies , all subjects developed high titers of anti-AT@ antibodies ( GM @ ) in response to both AT@-KLH doses .
RESULTS	These antibodies were also capable of recognizing AT@ within the p@ framework .
CONCLUSIONS	The AT@ peptide-based approach has allowed to redirect HAART-treated patients ' humoral responses toward a previously untargeted hotspot of functional activity .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , the tested AT@-KLH doses were safe and well tolerated , supporting further exploration of AT@-KLH as an HIV-@ therapeutic vaccine candidate .

OBJECTIVE	Hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy are at increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death .
OBJECTIVE	Lowering blood pressure ( BP ) after stroke reduces the risk of recurrent stroke , but recent data suggest that lower systolic BP ( SBP ) measured @ years after stroke is associated with increased mortality .
OBJECTIVE	Whether lower SBP is associated with increased short-term mortality after stroke in hypertensive patients is unclear .
METHODS	All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were examined in relation to average on-treatment SBP after stroke in @ hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy randomly assigned to losartan - or atenolol-based treatment who had new strokes during follow-up .
METHODS	Patients with on-treatment SBP < @ mm Hg ( lowest tertile ) and SBP > @ ( highest tertile ) were compared with patients with average SBP between @ and @ .
RESULTS	During @ years mean follow-up after incident stroke , @ patients ( @ % ) died , @ ( @ % ) from cardiovascular causes .
RESULTS	In multivariate Cox analyses , adjusting for significant univariate predictors of mortality , compared with average SBP between @ and @ , an average SBP < @ was a significant predictor of all-cause ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) and cardiovascular mortality ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) , whereas patients who had an average SBP > @ had no significant increased risk of death .
CONCLUSIONS	Lower achieved SBP ( < @ mm Hg ) is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after initial stroke in hypertensive patients during short-term follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study is required to determine ideal SBP goals after stroke .

BACKGROUND	LifeWave Energy Enhancer ( LEE ) patches ( LifeWave Corp , San Diego , CA , USA ) on skin produce some changes that are consistent with increased energy production , but little is known about their effects on cortisol concentrations or the peripheral circulation .
OBJECTIVE	The study intended to assess the effects of LEE patches on salivary cortisol , peripheral circulation , and psychological measures on healthy adults .
METHODS	A double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized pilot study was performed .
METHODS	Measurements were made in the laboratory at Mind-Body-Science ( Tucson , AZ , USA ) .
METHODS	Participants collected some of the saliva samples at work or home .
METHODS	To obtain pilot data , @ healthy individuals with no chronic conditions were recruited-@ males and @ females-aged @-@ y.
METHODS	Participants completed baseline psychological questionnaires and provided saliva samples for hormonal analysis .
METHODS	The next day , fingertip microvascular perfusion was measured , LEE or placebo patches were applied to participants ' wrists , and perfusion scans were repeated , first immediately after and then @ min after application of the patch .
METHODS	Saliva samples were collected , and questionnaires were completed .
METHODS	Participants returned at noon and @:@ PM for further scans , and at the end of that time , the patches were removed .
METHODS	The protocol was repeated the following day using new patches .
METHODS	The research team analyzed the saliva samples for levels of cortisol and measured the percentage changes in cutaneous microvascular perfusion .
METHODS	The participants completed the energy visual analog scales ( eVASs ) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability survey .
RESULTS	After the first patch application , the active group showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations than the placebo group , both at noon-@ @ @ ng/mL vs @ @ ( P = @ ) , respectively-and at @:@ PM - @ @ vs @ @ ( P = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	No consistent changes occurred in perfusion .
RESULTS	The eVAS score decreased significantly compared with baseline in the placebo group but not in the active group .
CONCLUSIONS	Cortisol concentrations and eVAS scores showed significant differences between groups , which is consistent with the patches increasing energy production , warranting further testing .

BACKGROUND	Due to the availability of new devices , the use of ventricular assist devices ( VADs ) in children has been increasing ; however , patient selection and optimal timing of device implantation in this population remains uncertain .
METHODS	A retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing dataset identified @,@ listings without mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) for isolated pediatric heart transplant , @ to @ .
METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into a derivation and validation cohort .
METHODS	A multivariable logistic regression model predicting the likelihood of death or need for MCS within @ days was built using the derivation cohort and tested in the validation cohort .
METHODS	A simplified score ( PedsMCS score ) was developed and evaluated for accuracy .
RESULTS	The predictive model consisted of variables present at listing ( age , albumin level , creatinine clearance , serum bilirubin , mechanical ventilation , and inotropic support ) .
RESULTS	It had good predictive ability ( C statistic @ ) within the validation cohort .
RESULTS	The simplified PedsMCS score was also predictive ( C statistic @ ) and there was a strong correlation between predicted and expected outcomes ( r = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with PedsMCS score @ or greater had a significantly higher risk of death or MCS within @ months ( @ % ) than those with low scores ( < @ ) ( @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A single point increase in PedsMCS score was associated with a @ % increase in the risk of death or MCS with @ months ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We have developed and validated a simplified score to predict the need for MCS based on risk factors present at listing .
CONCLUSIONS	This will provide more accurate prognostication in children awaiting heart transplant , and may improve patient selection .

###24958603
OBJECTIVE	Not all hypertensive patients respond well to ACE inhibition .
OBJECTIVE	Here we determined whether renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) phenotyping , i.e. , the measurement of renin or ACE , can predict the individual response to RAS blockade , either chronically ( enalapril vs. enalapril + candesartan ) or acutely ( enalaprilhydrochlorothiazide , HCT ) .
RESULTS	Chronic enalapril + candesartan induced larger renin rises , but did not lower blood pressure ( BP ) more than enalapril .
RESULTS	Similar observations were made for enalapril + HCT vs. enalapril when given acutely .
RESULTS	Baseline renin predicted the peak changes in BP chronically , but not acutely .
RESULTS	Baseline ACE levels had no predictive value .
RESULTS	Yet , after acute drug intake , the degree of ACE inhibition , like renin , did correlate with BP .
RESULTS	Only the relationship with renin remained significant after chronic RAS blockade .
RESULTS	Thus , a high degree of ACE inhibition and a steep renin rise associate with larger acute responses to enalapril .
RESULTS	However , variation was large , ranging > @mm Hg for a given degree of ACE inhibition or renin .
RESULTS	The same was true for the relationships between renin and BP , and between baseline renin and the maximum reduction in BP in the chronic study .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data do not support that RAS phenotyping will help to predict the individual BP response to RAS blockade .
CONCLUSIONS	Notably , these conclusions were reached in a carefully characterized , homogenous population , and when taking into account the known fluctuations in renin that relate to gender , age , ethnicity , salt intake and diuretic treatment , it seems unlikely that a cut-off renin level can be defined that has predictive value .

BACKGROUND	The main challenge in CT screening for lung cancer is the high prevalence of pulmonary nodules and the relatively low incidence of lung cancer .
BACKGROUND	Management protocols use thresholds for nodule size and growth rate to determine which nodules require additional diagnostic procedures , but these should be based on individuals ' probabilities of developing lung cancer .
BACKGROUND	In this prespecified analysis , using data from the NELSON CT screening trial , we aimed to quantify how nodule diameter , volume , and volume doubling time affect the probability of developing lung cancer within @ years of a CT scan , and to propose and evaluate thresholds for management protocols .
METHODS	Eligible participants in the NELSON trial were those aged @-@ years , who have smoked @ cigarettes or more per day for more than @ years , or ten cigarettes or more for more than @ years and were still smoking , or had stopped smoking less than @ years ago .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to low-dose CT screening at increasing intervals , or no screening .
METHODS	We included all participants assigned to the screening group who had attended at least one round of screening , and whose results were available from the national cancer registry database .
METHODS	We calculated lung cancer probabilities , stratified by nodule diameter , volume , and volume doubling time and did logistic regression analysis using diameter , volume , volume doubling time , and multinodularity as potential predictor variables .
METHODS	We assessed management strategies based on nodule threshold characteristics for specificity and sensitivity , and compared them to the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) guidelines .
METHODS	The NELSON trial is registered at www.trialregister.nl , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Volume , volume doubling time , and volumetry-based diameter of @ non-calcified nodules detected by CT screening in @ participants in the screening group of NELSON were used to quantify lung cancer probability .
RESULTS	Lung cancer probability was low in participants with a nodule volume of @ mm ( @ ) or smaller ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) or maximum transverse diameter smaller than @ mm ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ) , and not significantly different from participants without nodules ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Lung cancer probability was intermediate ( requiring follow-up CT ) if nodules had a volume of @-@ mm ( @ ) ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) or a diameter @-@ mm ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	Volume doubling time further stratified the probabilities : @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) for volume doubling times @ days or more , @ % ( @-@ ) for volume doubling times @-@ days , and @ % ( @-@ ) for volume doubling times of @ days or fewer .
RESULTS	Lung cancer probability was high for participants with nodule volumes @ mm ( @ ) or bigger ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) or diameters @ mm or bigger ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ) .
RESULTS	The simulated ACCP management protocol yielded a sensitivity and specificity of @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) , and @ % ( @-@ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	A diameter-based protocol with volumetry-based nodule diameter yielded a higher sensitivity ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) , and a higher specificity ( @ % -LSB- @-@ ) .
RESULTS	A volume-based protocol ( with thresholds based on lung cancer probability ) yielded the same sensitivity as the ACCP protocol ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- ) , and a higher specificity ( @ % -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Small nodules ( those with a volume < @ mm ( @ ) or diameter < @ mm ) are not predictive for lung cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Immediate diagnostic evaluation is necessary for large nodules ( @ mm ( @ ) or @ mm ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Volume doubling time assessment is advocated only for intermediate-sized nodules ( with a volume ranging between @-@ mm ( @ ) or diameter of @-@ mm ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Nodule management protocols based on these thresholds performed better than the simulated ACCP nodule protocol .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this research was to compare the pharmacodynamics of the combination of mitiglinide and sitagliptin to that of each agent alone in Korean patients with type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) .
METHODS	Patients with T@DM received mitiglinide alone , sitagliptin alone , or both drugs together in randomized sequence .
METHODS	A meal tolerance test ( MTT ) was conducted for each group , and plasma concentrations of glucose , insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , and intact glucagon-like peptide-@ , and dipeptidyl peptidase-@ activity were measured from @ h before breakfast through @ h after breakfast on day @ ( pretreatment ) and day @ ( posttreatment ) of each treatment period .
METHODS	Integrated values of these pharmacodynamic variables were analyzed for changes from pretreatment to posttreatment and for differences between the three treatment groups .
RESULTS	Twenty-six patients with glycated hemoglobin A@c level of @ % @ % , fasting plasma glucose concentration of @ @ mg/dL , postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) concentration of @ @ mg/dL @ h after the MTT , and diabetes duration of @ @ years ( mean SD ) were included in the study .
RESULTS	Compared with mitiglinide or sitagliptin alone , the combination treatment lowered PPG additively ( P < @ vs. mitiglinide or sitagliptin alone ) and the insulin secretory response ( P = @ vs. mitiglinide or sitagliptin alone ) .
RESULTS	The integrated insulin concentrations changed significantly from before to after treatment ( P < @ ) , but the change did not differ between the combination and mitiglinide groups .
RESULTS	The insulinogenic index increased significantly after the combination treatment ( P < @ vs. mitiglinide or sitagliptin alone ) .
RESULTS	The combination of mitiglinide and sitagliptin was generally well tolerated , with no hypoglycemic events .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of mitiglinide and sitagliptin did not trigger hypoglycemia and controlled postprandial glucose excursion more effectively compared with either drug alone .

BACKGROUND	Alterations of the parameters of heart rate variability , phenomenon associated with autonomic nervous system balance , have been shown as a possibly very important factor for monitoring of cardiocirculatory system in the perioperative period .
BACKGROUND	Periinduction period of general anaesthesia is very important with significant changes of haemodynamics what could be reflected in the changes of the parameter of heart rate variability .
METHODS	A hundred patients of ASA I and ASA II status who were scheduled for elective abdominal surgical procedures of moderate stress response , were randomly assigned to group I and group II , who were administered propofol or thiopentone as induction anaesthetic , respectively .
METHODS	Monitoring during periinduction period included of monitoring of mean blood pressure ( noninvasively ) , heart rate , pulseoxymetry and recording of electrocardiogram by holter ECG recorder for further analysis of heart rate variability , in four time segments in periinduction period : Tp , T@ , T@ , T@ .
METHODS	Data were presented as mean values of absolute values of the power of the total spectrum of heart rate variability , mean values of the spectrum of low frequency band ( LF ) , mean values of the high frequency range , and the ratio LF/HF .
RESULTS	Analysis of the values of hemodynamic parameters has shown decrease of mean arterial blood pressure after induction of anaesthesia with intravenous anesthetics thiopental or propofol , with simultaneous changes of heart rate in the four time segments in periinduction period , without statistically significant changes between the groups .
RESULTS	Analysis of the values of parameters of heart rate variability measured in the frequency domain has shown changes of mean values of the absolute values of total power spectrum , mean values of the power of low frequency spectrum and mean values of the power of high power spectrum with reduction of the values of total power spectrum , the power of low frequency spectrum and the power of high frequency spectrum , most pronounced just after induction of anaesthesia with slight increase of the values of total power spectrum and individual components of the spectrum of heart rate variability in the later postinduction period , without statistically significant differences between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The results have shown that in the groups of patients who underwent induction of general anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone , there have been reductions of the total spectral power and the power of the spectrum of low frequency components and high frequency components with variations in the relationship between the components in the different periods of periinduction time .

BACKGROUND	In a task-environment where visibility has deteriorated , individuals rely heavily on tactile performance ( perception and manipulation ) to complete complex tasks .
BACKGROUND	When this happens under hyperbaric conditions , factors like nitrogen narcosis could influence a person 's ability to successfully complete such tasks .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the effect of nitrogen narcosis on a complex neuropsychological task measuring tactile performance at a pressure of @ kPa ( @ atm abs ) , in the absence of visual access to the task .
METHODS	In a prospective cross-over study , @ commercial divers were tested in a dry chamber at @ kPa and @ kPa .
METHODS	They completed the Tupperware Neuropsychological Task ( TNT ) of tactile performance without visual access to the task , and completed questionnaires to provide psychological and biographical data , which included trait anxiety and transient mood states , as well as formal qualifications and technical proficiency .
RESULTS	A significant decrement ( @ % , P < @ ) in performance on the TNT at depth was found , irrespective of the sequence of testing .
RESULTS	Generally , neither the psychological nor biographical variables showed any significant effect on tactile performance .

BACKGROUND	Within the field of oncology , increasing access to high quality care has been identified as a priority to reduce cancer disparities .
BACKGROUND	Previous research reveals that the facilities where patients receive their cancer care have implications for cancer outcomes .
BACKGROUND	However , there is little understanding of how patients decide where to seek cancer care .
BACKGROUND	This study examined the factors that shape patients ' pathways to seek their cancer care at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center ( NCI-CCC ) , and differences in these factors by race , income and education .
METHODS	In-depth interviews and survey questionnaires were administered to a random sample of @ patients at one NCI-CCC in the Northeast US .
METHODS	In-depth interview data was first analyzed qualitatively to identify themes and patterns in patients ' pathways to receive their cancer care at an NCI-CCC .
METHODS	Logistic Regression was used to examine if these pathways varied by patient race , income , and education .
RESULTS	Two themes emerged : following the recommendation of a physician and following advice from social network members .
RESULTS	Quantitative data analysis shows that patient pathways to care at an NCI-CCC varied by education and income .
RESULTS	Patients with lower income and education most commonly sought their cancer care at an NCI-CCC due to the recommendation of a physician .
RESULTS	Patients with higher income and education most commonly cited referral by a specialist physician or the advice of a social network member .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in pathways to care by race .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings show that most patients relied on physician recommendations or advice from a social network member in deciding to seek their cancer care at an NCI-CCC .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to the role of physicians in shaping patients ' pathways to the NCI-CCC , initiatives that strengthen partnerships between NCI-CCCs and community physicians who serve underserved communities may improve access to NCI-CCCs .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the effects of plyometric training versus basketball technique training on improving neuro-muscular performance .
METHODS	Thirty-six ( age @ years , body height @ cm , body weight @ kg , BMI @ kgm-@ ) basketball players girls were randomly allocated to @ groups : Basketball Plyometric Training ( BPT , N. = @ ) and Basketball Technique Training ( BTT , N. = @ ) .
METHODS	The players were tested by two specific tests : counter movement jump ( CMJ ) and squat jump ( SJ ) before and after @ training weeks .
RESULTS	The jump height , as dependent variable , showed a different trend as an effect of the different training protocols , in contrast with the current knowledge .
RESULTS	Manova did not show significant interactions between the two groups for the height of jumps , while significant differences were found for interaction time training ( P < @ ) and for main effect time ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	After training , the BPT group increased significantly CMJ performance by @ % ( P < @ ) , whereas the BTT group increased by @ % .
RESULTS	Likewise , the BPT group demonstrated a significant greater improvement of jump height than BTT group ( an increase of @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ; respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that both training protocols proposed in this study improved vertical jump performance .
CONCLUSIONS	However , a combination of the two protocols , plyometric training and sport-specific-exercises , could be useful to optimize performance by an easy transition from controlled a-specific to sport-specific performance requirements .
CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , BPT is a safe and effective method of achieving a favourable neuro-muscular performance than BTT in female basketball players .

OBJECTIVE	Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been implicated in visceral hypersensitivity .
OBJECTIVE	However , the specific contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to determine whether physiological and pharmacological manipulation of parasympathetic tone influences the development of hypersensitivity in a validated model of acid-induced oesophageal pain .
METHODS	Prior to , and following , a @-min distal oesophageal infusion of @ M hydrochloric acid , pain thresholds to electrical stimulation were determined in the proximal non-acid exposed oesophagus in healthy subjects .
METHODS	Validated sympathetic ( skin conductance response ) and parasympathetic ( cardiac vagal tone ) parameters were measured at baseline and continuously thereafter .
METHODS	In study @ , @ subjects were randomised in a pragmatic blinded crossover design to receive deep breathing or un-paced breathing during acid infusion .
METHODS	In study @ , @ subjects were randomised in a blinded , crossover design to receive intravenous atropine or placebo ( saline ) with deep breathing during acid infusion .
RESULTS	Study @ : Deep breathing increased cardiac vagal tone ( @ vs -@ , p = @ ) with concomitant withdrawal of skin conductance response ( -@ vs @ , p = @ ) in comparison with un-paced breathing .
RESULTS	Deep breathing prevented the development of acid-induced oesophageal hypersensitivity in comparison with sham breathing ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Study @ : Atropine , in comparison with placebo , blocked the attenuating effect of deep breathing on the development of acid-induced oesophageal hypersensitivity ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The development of oesophageal hyperalgesia is prevented by physiologically increasing parasympathetic tone .
CONCLUSIONS	This effect is pharmacologically blocked with atropine , providing evidence that the PNS influences the development of oesophageal pain hypersensitivity .

BACKGROUND	A prospective , randomized study examined the effect of interventional preoperative education and orientation for scoliosis surgery ( PEOSS ) on anxiety levels of patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion ( PSF ) .
BACKGROUND	Secondary outcomes analyzed were caregiver anxiety , length of stay , morphine equivalent usage , and patient/caregiver satisfaction .
METHODS	Patients undergoing PSF were randomly distributed into a control group ( N = @ ) or interventional group ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	All subjects and caregivers completed the State ( current ) - Trait ( typical ) Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) at different intervals : preoperative appointment , preoperative holding area , postoperative orthopaedic unit , and discharge .
METHODS	At discharge , patients and caregivers completed a satisfaction survey .
RESULTS	Significantly higher state anxiety scores were found compared with baseline at all time intervals in both the control group and PEOSS group .
RESULTS	The PEOSS group had higher state anxiety scores than the control group at the postoperative interval ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the caregiver state anxiety scores between the groups at any time interval .
RESULTS	Trait anxiety scores for both groups remained stable over time , establishing that the measurement tool accurately reflected baseline anxiety .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found in length of stay or morphine equivalent use .
RESULTS	Patient satisfaction scores were higher in the PEOSS group than in the control group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	PSF was associated with increased anxiety at all time intervals in adolescents in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In the PEOSS group , PSF was associated with increased anxiety in the immediate postoperative period .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the increase in anxiety , patient satisfaction was higher in the intervention group .
CONCLUSIONS	It is likely that patients need age-appropriate information and educational strategies to minimize anxiety during PSF .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is underway to study and develop more effective interventional strategies .
METHODS	Level I study .

OBJECTIVE	A head-to-head comparison was performed between vascular endothelial growth factor blockade and laser for treatment of diabetic macular edema ( DME ) .
METHODS	Two similarly designed , double-masked , randomized , phase @ trials , VISTA ( DME ) and VIVID ( DME ) .
METHODS	We included @ patients ( eyes ) with type @ or @ diabetes mellitus who presented with DME with central involvement .
METHODS	Eyes received either intravitreal aflibercept injection ( IAI ) @ mg every @ weeks ( @q@ ) , IAI @ mg every @ weeks after @ initial monthly doses ( @q@ ) , or macular laser photocoagulation .
METHODS	The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letters at week @ .
METHODS	Secondary efficacy endpoints at week @ included the proportion of eyes that gained @ letters from baseline and the mean change from baseline in central retinal thickness as determined by optical coherence tomography .
RESULTS	Mean BCVA gains from baseline to week @ in the IAI @q@ and @q@ groups versus the laser group were @ and @ versus @ letters ( P < @ ) in VISTA , and @ and @ versus @ letters ( P < @ ) in VIVID .
RESULTS	The corresponding proportions of eyes gaining @ letters were @ % and @ % versus @ % ( P < @ ) in VISTA , and @ % and @ % versus @ % ( P < @ ) in VIVID .
RESULTS	Similarly , mean reductions in central retinal thickness were @ and @ versus @ m ( P < @ ) in VISTA , and @ and @ versus @ m ( P < @ ) in VIVID .
RESULTS	Overall incidences of ocular and nonocular adverse events and serious adverse events , including the Anti-Platelet Trialists ' Collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic events and vascular deaths , were similar across treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	At week @ , IAI demonstrated significant superiority in functional and anatomic endpoints over laser , with similar efficacy in the @q@ and @q@ groups despite the extended dosing interval in the @q@ group .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of sublingual asenapine .
METHODS	Healthy male volunteers ( n = @ , age @-@ years ) randomly received a single sublingual dose of asenapine @ mg after @ h fasting ( Treatment A , reference ) , after a high-fat meal ( Treatment B ) and after @ h fasting with a high-fat meal at @ h post-dose ( Treatment C ) .
METHODS	Blood samples were drawn over @ h to measure asenapine plasma concentrations .
METHODS	Effects of food intake on asenapine pharmacokinetics were assessed using bioequivalence criteria and evaluated using a compartmental modelling analysis .
RESULTS	Compared with the reference , mean asenapine exposure ( AUC@-last and AUC@ - ) was approximately @ % lower after intake of a high-fat meal prior to dosing , whereas Cmax decreased by only about @ % .
RESULTS	When a high-fat meal was taken @ h post-dose in the fasting state , asenapine concentrations were similar to the reference during the first @ h post-dose .
RESULTS	After the meal intake , asenapine concentrations decreased quickly for several hours .
RESULTS	Compartmental modelling indicated that a transient @-fold increase in asenapine clearance after eating could explain the asenapine concentration-time profiles for both food regimens .
CONCLUSIONS	To our knowledge , this is the first study investigating the effect of food upon the sublingual administration of a drug .
CONCLUSIONS	A high-fat meal taken before or @ h post-dose of sublingual asenapine indirectly caused a transient increase in liver blood flow that resulted in a temporal increase in asenapine clearance .
CONCLUSIONS	As the effects on asenapine exposure were small and not clinically relevant , no additional restrictions are required for the timing of food intake in relation to asenapine dosing .

BACKGROUND	Little is known about how the genetic variation in vitamin D modulating genes influences ultraviolet ( UV ) B-induced @-hydroxyvitamin D -LSB- @ ( OH ) D -RSB- concentrations .
BACKGROUND	In the Food with vitamin D ( VitmaD ) study , we showed that common genetic variants rs@ and rs@ in @-hydroxylase ( CYP@R@ ) and rs@ and rs@ in vitamin D binding protein ( GC ) predict @ ( OH ) D concentrations at late summer and after @-mo consumption of cholecalciferol ( vitamin D ) - fortified bread and milk .
OBJECTIVE	In the current study , called the Vitamin D in genes ( VitDgen ) study , we analyzed associations between the increase in @ ( OH ) D concentrations after a given dose of artificial UVB irradiation and @ single nucleotide polymorphisms located in or near genes involved in vitamin D synthesis , transport , activation , or degradation as previously described for the VitmaD study .
OBJECTIVE	Second , we aimed to determine whether the genetic variations in CYP@R@ and GC have similar effects on @ ( OH ) D concentrations after artificial UVB irradiation and supplementation by vitamin D-fortified bread and milk .
METHODS	The VitDgen study includes @ healthy Danes who received @ whole-body UVB treatments with a total dose of @ or @ standard erythema doses during a @-d period in winter .
METHODS	The VitmaD study included @ healthy Danish families who were given vitamin D-fortified bread and milk or placebo for @ mo during the winter .
RESULTS	After UVB treatments , rs@ in CYP@R@ and rs@ in GC predicted UVB-induced @ ( OH ) D concentrations as previously shown in the VitmaD study .
RESULTS	Compared with noncarriers , carriers of @ risk alleles of rs@ and rs@ had lowest concentrations and smallest increases in @ ( OH ) D concentrations after @ UVB treatments and largest decreases in @ ( OH ) D concentrations after @-mo consumption of vitamin D-fortified bread and milk .
CONCLUSIONS	Common genetic variants in the CYP@R@ and GC genes modify @ ( OH ) D concentrations in the same manner after artificial UVB-induced vitamin D and consumption of vitamin D-fortified bread and milk .

BACKGROUND	Topical photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) for actinic keratoses ( AK ) is hampered by pain during illumination and inferior efficacy in organ-transplant recipients ( OTR ) .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) - assisted daylight photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) ( AFL-dPDT ) compared with daylight PDT ( dPDT ) , conventional PDT ( cPDT ) and AFL alone ( AFL ) in field treatment of AK in OTR .
METHODS	In each patient , four areas in the same region were randomized to one treatment with AFL-dPDT , dPDT , cPDT and AFL .
METHODS	AFL was delivered with a @-nm AFL at @ mJ per pulse , @ W , two stacks , @-s pulse-duration , @ % density .
METHODS	In dPDT and AFL-dPDT , methyl aminolaevulinate ( MAL ) was applied for @ h without occlusion during daylight exposure .
METHODS	For cPDT , MAL was occluded for @ h followed by red-light ( @ nm ) irradiation at @ J cm ( -@ ) .
METHODS	The primary end-point was complete response ( CR ) @ months post-treatment .
RESULTS	Sixteen patients with @ AK ( grades I-III ) in field-cancerized skin of the scalp , chest and extremities were treated during August and September @ .
RESULTS	After @ months , CR ( AK I-III ) rates were @ % after AFL-dPDT , @ % after dPDT , @ % after cPDT and @ % after AFL ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	CR rates in AFL-dPDT , dPDT and cPDT were also significantly different ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median maximal pain scores differed significantly during AFL-dPDT ( @ ) , dPDT ( @ ) , AFL ( @ ) and cPDT ( @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Erythema and crusting were more intense following AFL-dPDT than dPDT and cPDT , but only transient hypopigmentation was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	AFL-dPDT is a novel PDT modality that enhances CR with excellent tolerability compared with dPDT and cPDT in difficult-to-treat AK in OTR .

BACKGROUND	Microprocessor knees have improved the gait and functional abilities of persons with transfemoral amputation .
BACKGROUND	The Genium prosthetic knee offers an advanced sensor and control system designed to decrease impairment by : allowing greater stance phase flexion , easing transitions between gait phases , and compensating for changes in terrain .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to determine differences between the knee flexion angle of persons using the Genium knee , the C-Leg knee , and non-amputee controls ; and to evaluate the impact the prostheses on gait and level of impairment of the user .
METHODS	This study used a randomized experimental crossover of persons with transfemoral amputation using the Genium and C-Leg microprocessor knees ( n = @ ) , with an observational sample of non-amputee controls ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Gait analysis by @D motion tracking of subjects ambulating at different speeds on level ground and on @ and @ ramps was completed .
RESULTS	Use of the Genium resulted in a significant increase in peak knee flexion for swing ( @ , p < @ , d = @ ) and stance ( @ , p < @ , d = @ ) phases relative to C-Leg use .
RESULTS	There was a high degree of variability between subjects , and significant differences still remain between the Genium group and the control group 's knee flexion angles for most speeds and slopes .
CONCLUSIONS	The Genium knee generally increases flexion in swing and stance , potentially decreasing the level of impairment for persons with transfemoral amputation .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates functional differences between the C-Leg and Genium knees to help prosthetists determine if the Genium will provide functional benefits to individual patients .

OBJECTIVE	The present study aimed to assess the effects of two different sports training methods - traditional and maturational - on the flexibility of female rhythmic gymnasts at different levels of biological maturation .
METHODS	The sample consisted of @ children , randomly divided ( by draw ) into six groups of @ children ( eight and nine-years old ) : traditional training group ( TG ) ; maturational training group ( MG ) ; and the control group ( CG ) .
METHODS	These were subdivided into early , normal and late , based on biological maturation assessment by hand/wrist X-ray examination .
METHODS	Flexibility was evaluated by angle goniometer testing , applying the LABIFIE protocol .
METHODS	A Lafayette Goniometer Set and Hoorn-Brasil exercise mat were used and the following exercises were performed : external shoulder rotation ( ESR ) and lumbar flexion ( LF ) .
METHODS	Both the TG and MG participated in twice-weekly , @-minute rhythmic gymnastics classes over @ weeks .
METHODS	The TG used the traditional sports training method while the MG executed sporting activities according to biological maturation .
METHODS	The CG received no special treatment .
RESULTS	The results showed a significant improvement ( P < @ ) in the subgroups ( late , normal and early ) for both variables ( ESR = @ and LF = @ ) in the eight and nine-year age groups .
RESULTS	Moreover , in relation to division by biological maturity , better results were recorded in the early subgroups .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , it can be inferred that , due to the changes in important physical parameters as a result of maturation , selecting children for physical education should not be based solely on chronological , but primarily on biological maturation .

OBJECTIVE	Gender differences in the prevalence of sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome may be mediated via male sex hormones .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to determine the exact pathway for a testosterone-mediated increased propensity for central sleep apnea via blockade of the @-reductase pathway of testosterone conversion by finasteride .
METHODS	Randomization to oral finasteride vs. sham , single-center study .
METHODS	Sleep research laboratory .
METHODS	Fourteen healthy young males without sleep apnea .
METHODS	Hypocapnia was induced via brief nasal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation during stable NREM sleep .
METHODS	Cessation of mechanical ventilation resulted in hypocapnic central apnea or hypopnea .
RESULTS	The apnea threshold ( AT ) was defined as the end-tidal CO ( P ( ET ) CO ) that demarcated the central apnea closest to the eupneic P ( ET ) CO. .
RESULTS	The CO reserve was defined as the difference in P ( ET ) CO between eupnea and AT .
RESULTS	The apneic threshold and CO reserve were measured at baseline and repeated after at a minimum of @ month .
RESULTS	Administration of finasteride resulted in decreased serum dihydrotestosterone .
RESULTS	In the finasteride group , the eupneic ventilatory parameters were unchanged ; however , the AT was decreased ( @ @ mm Hg vs. @ @ mm Hg , P = @ ) and the CO reserve was increased ( -@ @ mm Hg vs. -@ @ mm Hg , P = @ ) at follow-up , with a significantly lower hypocapnic ventilatory response , thus indicating increased breathing stability during sleep .
RESULTS	No significant changes were noted in the sham group on follow-up study .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of testosterone action via the @-reductase pathway may be effective in alleviating breathing instability during sleep , presenting an opportunity for novel therapy for central sleep apnea in selected populations .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether directly measured arterial blood pressure differs among anatomic locations and whether arterial blood pressure is influenced by body position .
METHODS	@ client-owned dogs undergoing anesthesia .
METHODS	Dogs undergoing anesthetic procedures had @-gauge catheters placed in both the superficial palmar arch and the contralateral dorsal pedal artery ( group @ -LSB- n = @ -RSB- ) or the superficial palmar arch and median sacral artery ( group @ -LSB- @ -RSB- ) .
METHODS	Dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency , and mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) , systolic arterial blood pressure ( SAP ) , and diastolic arterial blood pressure ( DAP ) were recorded for both arteries @ times ( @-minute interval between successive measurements ) .
METHODS	Dogs were positioned in right lateral recumbency , and blood pressure measurements were repeated .
RESULTS	Differences were detected between pressures measured at the @ arterial sites in both groups .
RESULTS	This was especially true for SAP measurements in group @ , in which hind limb measurements were a mean of @ mm Hg higher than carpus measurements when dogs were in dorsal recumbency and @ mm Hg higher than carpus measurements when dogs were in lateral recumbency .
RESULTS	Also , there was significant dispersion about the mean for all SAP , DAP , and MAP measurements .
CONCLUSIONS	Results suggested that arterial blood pressures may be dependent on anatomic location and body position .
CONCLUSIONS	Because this may affect outcomes of studies conducted to validate indirect blood pressure measurement systems , care must be used when developing future studies or interpreting previous results .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the analgesic potential of the centrally acting analgesics tramadol , morphine and the novel analgesic tapentadol in a pre-clinical research model of acute nociceptive pain , the tail-flick model in dogs .
METHODS	Prospective part-randomized pre-clinical research trial .
METHODS	Fifteen male Beagle dogs ( HsdCpb : DOBE ) , aged @-@ months .
METHODS	On different occasions separated by at least @ week , dogs received intravenous ( IV ) administrations of tramadol ( @ , @ mg kg ( -@ ) ) , tapentadol ( @ , @ , @ mg kg ( -@ ) ) or morphine ( @ , @ , @ mg kg ( -@ ) ) with subsequent measurement of tail withdrawal latencies from a thermal stimulus ( for each treatment n = @ ) .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected immediately after the pharmacodynamic measurements of tramadol to determine pharmacokinetics and the active metabolite O-demethyltramadol ( M@ ) .
RESULTS	Tapentadol and morphine induced dose-dependent antinociception with ED@-values of @ mg kg ( -@ ) and @ mg kg ( -@ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	In contrast , tramadol did not induce antinociception at any dose tested .
RESULTS	Measurements of the serum levels of tramadol and the M@ metabolite revealed only marginal amounts of the M@ metabolite , which explains the absence of the antinociceptive effect of tramadol in this experimental pain model in dogs .
CONCLUSIONS	Different breeds of dogs might not or only poorly respond to treatment with tramadol due to low metabolism of the drug .
CONCLUSIONS	Tapentadol and morphine which act directly on - opioid receptors without the need for metabolic activation are demonstrated to induce potent antinociception in the experimental model used and should also provide a reliable pain management in the clinical situation .
CONCLUSIONS	The non-opioid mechanisms of tramadol do not provide antinociception in this experimental setting .
CONCLUSIONS	This contrasts to many clinical situations described in the literature , where tramadol appears to provide useful analgesia in dogs for post-operative pain relief and in more chronically pain states .

OBJECTIVE	Eye drops of aganirsen , an antisense oligonucleotide preventing insulin receptor substrate-@ expression , inhibited corneal neovascularization in a previous dose-finding phase II study .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to confirm these results in a phase III study and investigated a potential clinical benefit on visual acuity ( VA ) , quality of life ( QoL ) , and need for transplantation .
METHODS	Multicenter , double-masked , randomized , placebo-controlled phase III study .
METHODS	Analysis of @ patients with keratitis-related progressive corneal neovascularization randomized to aganirsen ( @ patients ) or placebo ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	Patients applied aganirsen eye drops ( @ g/day/eye ) or placebo twice daily for @ days and were followed up to day @ .
METHODS	The primary end point was VA. .
METHODS	Secondary end points included area of pathologic corneal neovascularization , need for transplantation , risk of graft rejection , and QoL .
RESULTS	Although no significant differences in VA scores between groups were observed , aganirsen significantly reduced the relative corneal neovascularization area after @ days by @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This improvement persisted after @ days ( @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Aganirsen tended to lower the transplantation need in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population at day @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In patients with viral keratitis and central neovascularization , a significant reduction in transplantation need was achieved ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences between groups were observed in the risk of graft rejection .
RESULTS	However , aganirsen tended to decrease this risk in patients with traumatic/viral keratitis ( P = @ ) at day @ .
RESULTS	The QoL analyses revealed a significant improvement with aganirsen in composite and near activity subscores ( P = @ and @ , respectively ) at day @ in the per protocol population .
RESULTS	Ocular and treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were reported in a lower percentage with aganirsen compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Only @ serious TEAEs ( @ with aganirsen and @ with placebo ) were considered treatment-related .
CONCLUSIONS	This first phase III study on a topical inhibitor of corneal angiogenesis showed that aganirsen eye drops significantly inhibited corneal neovascularization in patients with keratitis .
CONCLUSIONS	The need for transplantation was significantly reduced in patients with viral keratitis and central neovascularization .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical application of aganirsen was safe and well tolerated .

BACKGROUND	Structural learning theory suggests that experiencing motor task variation enables the central nervous system to extract general rules regarding tasks with a similar structure - rules that can subsequently be applied to novel situations .
BACKGROUND	Complex minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) requires different port sites , but switching ports alters the limb movements required to produce the same endpoint control of the surgical instrument .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study was to determine if structural learning theory can be applied to MIS to inform training methods .
METHODS	A tablet laptop running bespoke software was placed within a laparoscopic box trainer and connected to a monitor situated at eye level .
METHODS	Participants ( right-handed , non-surgeons , mean age = @ years ) used a standard laparoscopic grasper to move between locations on the screen .
METHODS	There were two training groups : the M group ( n = @ ) who trained using multiple port sites , and the S group ( n = @ ) who trained using a single port site .
METHODS	A novel port site was used as a test of generalization .
METHODS	Performance metrics were a composite of speed and accuracy ( SACF ) and normalized jerk ( NJ ; a measure of movement ` smoothness ' ) .
RESULTS	The M group showed a statistically significant performance advantage over the S group at test , as indexed by improved SACF ( p < @ ) and NJ ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study has demonstrated the potential benefits of incorporating a structural learning approach within MIS training .
CONCLUSIONS	This may have practical applications when training junior surgeons and developing surgical simulation devices .

BACKGROUND	The Randomized Olmesartan and Diabetes Microalbuminuria Prevention ( ROADMAP ) study showed that @ mg Olmesartan medoxomil ( OM ) versus placebo delayed microalbuminuria onset in patients with type @ diabetes and normoalbuminuria .
RESULTS	One thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight ROADMAP patients ( placebo arm : @ ; OM arm : @ ) participated in the observational follow up ( OFU ) with an average of @ years .
RESULTS	They received standard medical care and micro - and macrovascular events were documented .
RESULTS	During observational follow-up @ % and @ % in the former OM and placebo group , respectively , received treatment with a RAS blocking agent .
RESULTS	During the OFU period the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased to mean values of @ mm Hg in both groups .
RESULTS	Patients who had developed microalbuminuria during ROADMAP had a higher incidence of cardio - and cerebrovascular events ( OR @ , CI @ to @ , P = @ ) during the OFU period compared with patients in whom this was not the case .
RESULTS	Diabetic retinopathy was significantly reduced in the former OM group ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- versus @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , OR : @ , CI @ to @ , P = @ ) and the rate of microalbuminuria was numerically reduced .
RESULTS	Congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- versus @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , OR : @ , CI @ to @ , P = @ ) was reduced and there was a trend of reduced cardio - / cerebrovascular events ( OM versus Pb : @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- versus @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) .
RESULTS	Seven ( @ % ) deaths ( including @ CV events ) were reported in former placebo patients versus @ ( @ % ) ( non-CV events ) in former OM patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Development of microalbuminuria is a valid marker for future CV events .
CONCLUSIONS	RAS blockade with Olmesartan might cause sustained reduction ( legacy effect ) of micro - and macrovascular events .

BACKGROUND	Early mobilisation after stroke is thought to contribute to the effects of stroke-unit care ; however , the intervention is poorly defined and not underpinned by strong evidence .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare the effectiveness of frequent , higher dose , very early mobilisation with usual care after stroke .
METHODS	We did this parallel-group , single-blind , randomised controlled trial at @ acute stroke units in five countries .
METHODS	Patients ( aged @ years ) with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke , first or recurrent , who met physiological criteria were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) , via a web-based computer generated block randomisation procedure ( block size of six ) , to receive usual stroke-unit care alone or very early mobilisation in addition to usual care .
METHODS	Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was allowed .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by study site and stroke severity .
METHODS	Patients , outcome assessors , and investigators involved in trial and data management were masked to treatment allocation .
METHODS	The primary outcome was a favourable outcome @ months after stroke , defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of @-@ .
METHODS	We did analysis on an intention-to-treat basis .
METHODS	The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN@ .
RESULTS	Between July @ , @ , and Oct @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ patients to receive either very early mobilisation ( n = @ ) or usual care ( n = @ ) ; @ ( @ % ) patients were included in the @ month follow-up assessment .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients were mobilised within @ h in the very early mobilisation group compared with @ ( @ % ) patients in the usual care group .
RESULTS	Fewer patients in the very early mobilisation group had a favourable outcome than those in the usual care group ( n = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs n = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; adjusted odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients died in the very early mobilisation group compared with @ ( @ % ) patients in the usual care group ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients in the very early mobilisation group and @ ( @ % ) of those in the usual care group had a non-fatal serious adverse event , with no reduction in immobility-related complications with very early mobilisation .
CONCLUSIONS	First mobilisation took place within @ h for most patients in this trial .
CONCLUSIONS	The higher dose , very early mobilisation protocol was associated with a reduction in the odds of a favourable outcome at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Early mobilisation after stroke is recommended in many clinical practice guidelines worldwide , and our findings should affect clinical practice by refining present guidelines ; however , clinical recommendations should be informed by future analyses of dose-response associations .

BACKGROUND	To assess the short-term efficacy and safety of corneal collagen cross-linking ( CXL ) in preventing the progression of keratoconus ( KCN ) .
METHODS	This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled @ patients diagnosed with bilateral progressive KCN and were eligible for CXL .
METHODS	In each patient , one eye was randomly selected for treatment , and the contralateral eye served as the control .
METHODS	The patients underwent CXL with riboflavin drops and ultraviolet radiation in the treated eye .
METHODS	One year follow-up data are presented .
METHODS	Postoperatively , patients were assessed for progression of KCN , visual changes , and other findings .
METHODS	The main outcome measures were maximum simulated keratometry ( K-max ) , best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA ) , and average simulated keratometry .
METHODS	P < @ was considered as statistically significant .
RESULTS	In the treated eyes , the mean K-max values decreased by @ D at @-year postoperatively and increased by @ D in the control group .
RESULTS	This difference was statistically significant ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	BSCVA improved slightly ( a decrease of @ LogMAR ) and decreased slightly in the control group ( a @ LogMAR increase ) .
RESULTS	The difference between groups was statistically significant ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no decrease in visual acuity attributable to complications of CXL in the treated eyes .
RESULTS	At @-year , the keratometry in @ ( @ % ) treated eyes increased by more than @ D and were considered cases of failed treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Preliminary and @-year results indicate CXL can halt the progression of KCN in most cases without causing serious complications .

BACKGROUND	We describe the organization of a prospective , randomized , multicenter trial comparing the effectiveness of open popliteal artery aneurysm repair ( OPAR ) and endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm repair ( EPAR ) of asymptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms ( PAAs ) as an example for how to use the Vascular Quality Initiative ( VQI ) framework .
BACKGROUND	Given that many centers participate in the VQI , this model can be used to perform multicenters ' prospective trials on very modest budget .
METHODS	VQI prospectively collects data on many vascular procedures .
METHODS	These data include many important perioperative , intraoperative , and postoperative details regarding both patients and their procedures .
METHODS	We describe a study where minimal changes to the collected data by participating centers can provide level-@ evidence regarding a significant clinical question .
METHODS	Data will be collected using modified VQI forms within the existing VQI data reporting structure .
METHODS	We plan to enroll @ patients with asymptomatic PAAs into the open and endovascular surgery cohorts .
METHODS	Patients from participating VQI centers will be randomized @:@ to either OPAR or EPAR and will be followed for an average of @ years .
METHODS	Our primary hypothesis is that major adverse limb event-free survival is lower in the EPAR cohort and that EPAR is associated with more secondary interventions , improved quality of life , and decreased length of stay .
METHODS	The budget for this trial is fixed at $ @,@ / year for the course of the study , and the trial is judged to be feasible because of the functionality of the VQI platform .
CONCLUSIONS	Using the existing VQI infrastructure , Open versus Endovascular Repair of Popliteal Artery Aneurysm will provide level @ data for PAA treatment on a modest budget .
CONCLUSIONS	The proposed trial has an adequately powered comparative design that will use objective performance goals to describe limb-related morbidity and procedural reintervention rates .

BACKGROUND	Despite improvements in liver surgery over the past decades , hemostasis during hepatic resections remains challenging .
BACKGROUND	This multicenter randomized study compares the hemostatic effect of a collagen hemostat vs. a carrier-bound fibrin sealant after hepatic resection .
METHODS	Patients scheduled for elective liver resection were randomized intraoperatively to receive either the collagen hemostat ( COLL ) or the carrier-bound fibrin sealant ( CBFS ) for secondary hemostasis .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with hemostasis after @ min .
METHODS	Secondary parameters were the proportions of patients with hemostasis after @ and @ min , the total time to hemostasis , and the complication rates during a @ months follow-up period .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were included .
RESULTS	In the COLL group , @ out of @ patients ( @ % ) achieved complete hemostasis within @ min after application of the hemostat compared to @ out of @ patients ( @ % ) in the CBFS group .
RESULTS	The @ % confidence interval for this difference -LSB- -@ % , @ % -RSB- does not include the lower noninferiority margin ( -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Thus , the COLL treatment can be regarded as noninferior to the comparator .
RESULTS	The proportions of patients with hemostasis after @ , @ , and @ min were not significantly different between the two study arms .
RESULTS	Postoperative mortality and morbidity were similar in both treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The collagen hemostat is as effective as the carrier-bound fibrin sealant in obtaining secondary hemostasis during liver resection with a comparable complication rate .

OBJECTIVE	Several studies emphasise that arabinoxylan and - glucan have more beneficial effects on glucose metabolism than low-dietary fibre ( DF ) meals .
OBJECTIVE	Less attention has been paid to the effects of concentrated DF compared with whole grain .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the effects of DF and whole grain on glucose , hormone responses and appetite in subjects with the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) .
METHODS	Fifteen subjects with MetS participated in this acute , randomised , cross-over intervention study .
METHODS	The test breads provided @ g of digestible carbohydrate : wheat bread with concentrated arabinoxylan ( AX ) or - glucan ( BG ) , rye bread with kernels ( RK ) and wheat bread ( WB ) as control .
METHODS	Blood samples were drawn for @ min to determine glucose , insulin , glucagon-like peptide-@ , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) and ghrelin .
METHODS	Appetite score was addressed every @ min .
METHODS	Ad libitum energy intake ( EI ) was measured @ min after test meals .
RESULTS	Compared with WB , BG and RK induced lower initial glycaemic responses ( P < @ ) , whereas AX only reduced the glucose peak value ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	RK reduced insulin ( P < @ ) and GIP responses ( P < @ ) compared with the other breads .
RESULTS	BG lowered insulin responses more than AX ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	AX , BG and RK increased satiety feeling ( P < @ ) more than WB , but did not differ significantly in terms of subsequent EI ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BG and RK had beneficial impact on the glucose response , whereas AX had only effect on the postprandial glucose peak .
CONCLUSIONS	The impact of the AX bread was influenced by higher protein content .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether the metabolic effects of the breads are still present to mixed meals remains to be tested .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) infection among children in terms of Hp eradication rate and incidence of adverse events .
METHODS	A prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on @ children with a confirmed diagnosis of Hp infection .
METHODS	These patients were randomized into triple therapy ( n = @ ) and probiotics groups ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The triple therapy group received amoxicillin -LSB- @mg / ( kgd ) , Tid -RSB- , clarithromycin -LSB- @mg / ( kgd ) , Bid -RSB- and omeprazole -LSB- @-@ @ mg / ( kgd ) , Qd -RSB- , while the probiotics group received Saccharomyces boulardii ( @mg , Bid ) in addition to triple therapy .
METHODS	The course of treatment was @ days in both groups .
METHODS	The adverse events in subjects were recorded by their parents during treatment .
METHODS	Hp eradiation was evaluated by ( @ ) C breath test at @ weeks after treatment , and the eradication rate and incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	The Hp eradication rates were @ % ( @/@ ) in the triple therapy group and @ % ( @/@ ) in the probiotics group ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the triple therapy group , the probiotics group had nonsignificantly lower incidence of nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain ( P > @ ) and significantly lower incidence of stomatitis , constipation and diarrhea ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii can not significantly increase Hp eradication rate , but can significantly reduce the incidence of stomatitis , constipation , and diarrhea during treatment .

BACKGROUND	Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection is common among prisoners , particularly those with a history of injecting drug use ( IDU ) .
BACKGROUND	Incarcerated people who inject drugs frequently report high-risk injecting practices both in prison and in the community .
BACKGROUND	In spite of rising morbidity and mortality , utilisation of HCV-related services in Australia has been persistently low .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to describe the incidence , prevalence and correlates of HCV seropositivity in a large cohort of prisoners who have injected drugs , and to identify correlates of receiving confirmation of active infection .
METHODS	Data-linkage to a State-wide statutory notifiable diseases surveillance system was used to investigate the incidence of notified HCV seropositivity , seroconversion and confirmed HCV infection in a cohort of @ prisoners with a history of IDU , over @ years of follow up .
METHODS	Hepatitis C test results from prison medical records were used to identify correlates of testing positive in prison .
RESULTS	The crude incidence of HCV notification was @ cases per @ person-years .
RESULTS	By the end of follow up , @ % of the cohort had been the subject of a HCV-related notification , and @ % of those tested in prison were HCV seropositive .
RESULTS	In multivariable analyses , injecting in prison was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity , as was opioid use compared to injection of other drugs .
RESULTS	The rate of reported diagnostic confirmation among those with notified infections was very low , at @ confirmations per @ seropositive participants per year .
CONCLUSIONS	Injecting drugs in prison was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity , highlighting the need for increased provision of services to mitigate the risk of transmission within prisons .
CONCLUSIONS	Once identified as seropositive through screening , people with a history of IDU and incarceration may not be promptly receiving diagnostic services , which are necessary if they are to access treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Improving access to HCV-related services will be of particular importance in the coming years , as HCV-related morbidity and mortality is increasing , and next generation therapies are becoming more widely available .

OBJECTIVE	Data comparing the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with peginterferon plus low-dose ribavirin and peginterferon monotherapy in treatment-naive haemodialysis patients with hepatitis C virus genotype @ ( HCV-@ ) infection are limited .
METHODS	In this randomised trial , @ patients received @weeks of peginterferon alfa-@a @g/week plus ribavirin @mg/day ( n = @ ) or peginterferon alfa-@a @g/week ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The efficacy and safety endpoints were sustained virological response ( SVR ) rate and adverse event ( AE ) - related withdrawal rate .
RESULTS	Compared with monotherapy , combination therapy had a greater SVR rate ( @ % vs @ % , relative risk ( RR ) : @ -LSB- @ % CI @ to @ -RSB- ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The beneficial effect of combination therapy was more pronounced in patients with baseline viral load @,@ IU/mL than those with baseline viral load < @,@ IU/mL ( RR : @ -LSB- @ % CI @ to @ -RSB- vs. RR : @ -LSB- @ % CI @ to @ -RSB- ; interaction p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients receiving combination therapy were more likely to have a haemoglobin level of < @ g/dL ( @ % vs. @ % , risk difference ( RD ) : @ % -LSB- @ % CI @ % to @ % -RSB- ; p < @ ) and required a higher dosage -LSB- mean : @,@ vs. @ IU/week , p = @ -RSB- of epoetin to manage anaemia than those receiving monotherapy .
RESULTS	The AE-related withdrawal rates were @ % and @ % in combination therapy and monotherapy groups , respectively ( RD : @ % -LSB- @ % CI -@ % to @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In treatment-naive haemodialysis patients with HCV-@ infection , combination therapy with peginterferon plus low-dose ribavirin achieved a greater SVR rate than peginterferon monotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Most haemodialysis patients can tolerate combination therapy .

OBJECTIVE	The secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine-like @ ( SPARCL@ ) is expressed in various normal tissues and many types of cancers .
OBJECTIVE	The function of SPARCL@ and its relationship to a patient 's prognosis have been studied , whereas its relationship to radiation therapy ( RT ) is not known .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to investigate the expression of SPARCL@ in rectal cancer patients who participated in a clinical trial of preoperative RT. .
METHODS	The study included @ rectal cancer patients who were randomized to undergo preoperative RT and surgery ( n = @ ) or surgery alone ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The expression levels of SPARCL@ in normal mucosa ( n = @ ) , primary tumor ( n = @ ) , and lymph node metastasis ( n = @ ) were determined by immunohistochemistry .
RESULTS	Tumors with RT had stronger SPARCL@ expression than tumors without RT ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the RT group , strong SPARCL@ expression was related to better survival than weak expression in patients with stage III tumors , independent of sex , age , differentiation , and margin status ( P = @ ; RR = @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	No such relationship was found in the non-RT group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Further analysis of interactions among SPARCL@ expression , RT , and survival showed statistical significance ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In patients with metastases who received RT , strong SPARCL@ expression was related to better survival compared to weak expression ( P = @ ) but not in the non-RT group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	SPARCL@ expression increases with RT and is related to better prognosis in rectal cancer patients with RT but not in patients without RT. .
CONCLUSIONS	This result may help us to select the patients best suited for preoperative RT. .

BACKGROUND	Relatively few treatment programs have been developed specifically for smokeless tobacco ( ST ) users who want to quit .
BACKGROUND	Their results suggest that self-help materials , telephone counseling , and nicotine lozenges are efficacious .
BACKGROUND	This study provides the first direct examination of the separate and combined effects of telephone counseling and lozenges .
METHODS	We recruited ST users online ( N = @ ) and randomly assigned them to @ of @ conditions : ( a ) a lozenge group ( n = @ ) , who were mailed @-mg nicotine lozenges ; ( b ) a coach calls group ( n = @ ) , who were offered @ coaching phone calls ; or ( c ) a lozenge + coach calls group ( N = @ ) , who received both lozenges and coaching calls .
METHODS	Additionally , all participants were mailed self-help materials .
METHODS	Self-reported tobacco abstinence was assessed at @ and @ months after randomization .
RESULTS	Complete-case and intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analyses for all tobacco abstinence were performed at @ months , @ months , and both @ and @ months ( repeated point prevalence ) .
RESULTS	ITT analyses revealed a highly similar result : the lozenge + coach calls condition was significantly more successful in encouraging tobacco abstinence than either the lozenge group or the coach calls group , which did not differ .
CONCLUSIONS	Combining nicotine lozenges and phone counseling significantly increased tobacco abstinence rates compared with either intervention alone , whereas coach calls and lozenges were equivalent .
CONCLUSIONS	The study confirms the high tobacco abstinence rates for self-help ST cessation interventions and offers guidance to providing tobacco treatment to ST users .

BACKGROUND	The authors conducted a randomized , controlled , parallel-arm , superiority study to test the hypothesis that a continuous adductor canal block decreases the time to attain four discharge criteria compared with a continuous femoral nerve block after tricompartment knee arthroplasty .
METHODS	Subjects undergoing tricompartment knee arthroplasty were randomized using computer-generated lists to either an adductor canal or femoral perineural catheter ( @-day ropivacaine @ % infusion ) in an unmasked manner .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the time to attain four criteria : ( @ ) adequate analgesia ; ( @ ) intravenous opioids independence ; ( @ ) ability to stand , walk @ m , return , and sit down ; and ( @ ) ambulate @ m.
RESULTS	Subjects with an adductor canal catheter ( n = @ ) reached all four criteria in a median of @h ( interquartile , @ to @h ) compared with @h ( @ to @h ) for those with a femoral catheter ( n = @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @h ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of subjects who reached the two mobilization criteria on postoperative days @ and @ were @ and @ % for those with an adductor canal catheter ( n = @ ) , but only @ and @ % in subjects with a femoral catheter ( n = @ ; both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Differences in pain scores at rest and intravenous opioid requirements were minimal , but femoral infusion improved dynamic analgesia ( P = @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with a continuous femoral nerve block , a continuous adductor canal block did not appreciably decrease the time to overall discharge readiness even though it did decrease the time until adequate mobilization , primarily because both groups experienced similar analgesia and intravenous opioid requirements that -- in most cases -- exceeded the time to mobilization .

BACKGROUND	To our knowledge , only a few double-blind randomized controlled trials with antipsychotic drugs have been conducted to examine the treatment of methamphetamine-induced psychosis ( MAP ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study are to compare the antipsychotic and adverse events of quetiapine , an atypical antipsychotic drug , to haloperidol , a standard treatment for primary psychotic disorder , in individuals with MAP .
METHODS	Eighty individuals with MAP were randomly assigned into two groups , i.e. treatment with quetiapine ( n = @ ) and haloperidol ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Sixty-eight patients ( @ % ) completed the study protocol , i.e. treatment with quetiapine at least @ mg per day or haloperidol at least @ mg per day orally once a day for @ weeks .
METHODS	The doses were increased every @ days until no psychotic symptom was observed from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
METHODS	Data were analysed by survival analysis with Cox 's proportional regression analysis , general estimating equations and log-rank tests .
RESULTS	Thirty-two ( @ % ) subjects from the quetiapine group and @ subjects ( @ % ) from the haloperidol group met the remission criteria at the end of the study .
RESULTS	Baseline PANSS total scores of quetiapine and haloperidol groups were @ @ and @ @ , respectively ( mean SD ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The change-from-baseline scores were -@ for the quetiapine group and -@ for the haloperidol group .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the antipsychotic effects ( coefficient value = -@ , p = @ , @ % CI = -@ , @ ) and the adverse effects of quetiapine and haloperidol .
CONCLUSIONS	Quetiapine may be used as an antipsychotic treatment for MAP with comparable therapeutic effects and adverse events to treatment with classical antipsychotic drugs .

BACKGROUND	Despite the important role that health professionals have in reducing tobacco use , many have a smoking habit themselves .
BACKGROUND	The prevalence of smoking is particularly high among nurses .
OBJECTIVE	To test the efficacy , acceptability and feasibility of a motivational interviewing ( MI ) based smoking cessation intervention with nurses .
METHODS	Two group parallel experimental design with random allocation to groups .
METHODS	A large teaching hospital in the North of Spain .
METHODS	Nurses who smoked ( n = @ ) were randomised into two groups : motivational interviewing based intervention ( n = @ ) and usual care ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Motivational interviewing based intervention consisted of four individual MI sessions .
METHODS	Usual care consisted of brief advice .
METHODS	Variables considered to assess efficacy were biochemically verified smoking cessation , mean cigarettes smoked , stages of change , self-efficacy and depression score .
METHODS	Variables to assess acceptability and feasibility included participant satisfaction , adherence to MI , and duration of sessions .
METHODS	Data were collected at : baseline , end of intervention and three months after the end of the intervention .
RESULTS	At three month follow up , compared with the control group , more nurses in the intervention group had quit ( absolute difference @ % ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	In the nurses who did not quit , there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the number of cigarettes smoked per day , although progress in the stages of change was greater in the intervention group compared to the control group .
RESULTS	Measures of acceptability and feasibility indicated good satisfaction with the intervention , with high levels of attendance and completion .
CONCLUSIONS	This study found a beneficial effect of motivational interviewing on nurses ' smoking cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention was acceptable for nurses and a number of aspects were identified that need to be considered prior to conducting a larger scale in order to optimise the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Using MI might be a novel approach to the problem of health professionals who smoke .

BACKGROUND	The traditional treatment after closed reduction of distal radius ( DR ) and distal both bone ( DBB ) forearm fractures has been application of a long-arm cast ( LAC ) or a short-arm cast ( SAC ) .
BACKGROUND	Splinting is another option that avoids the potential complications associated with casting .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maintenance of reduction of DR or DBB fractures placed in a double-sugar-tong splint ( DSTS ) compared with a LAC in a pediatric population .
METHODS	This is an IRB-approved , prospective , randomized trial .
METHODS	Patients aged @ to @ years with DR or DBB fractures treated at a single institution between @ and @ were enrolled .
METHODS	After reduction , fractures were placed into either a LAC or a DSTS .
METHODS	Radiographs were reviewed at initial injury , postreduction , and at set intervals for angulation , displacement , and apposition , as well as cast index and @-point index .
METHODS	The DSTS was overwrapped into a cast after week @ .
METHODS	The immobilization device was changed to a SAC at week @ or @ .
METHODS	Total duration of immobilization was @ to @ weeks .
RESULTS	Seventy-one patients were enrolled with @ in the LAC and @ in the DSTS .
RESULTS	Average age was @ years ( range , @ to @ ) with @ being males .
RESULTS	There were @ isolated DR and @ DBB fractures .
RESULTS	There were no week-to-week differences between the @ groups in regards to sagittal alignment , coronal alignment , apposition , or displacement .
RESULTS	Sagittal alignment at immediate postreduction and week @ showed that the DSTS was slightly better ( average @ vs. @ degrees , respectively , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For the entire treatment period there was an increased risk of loss of reduction of @ degrees in the LAC group versus the DSTS group ( @ patients vs. @ patients , respectively , P = @ ) , and of meeting the criteria for remanipulation ( @ patients vs. @ patients , respectively , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At cast removal , there was no difference between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Although there were significant differences between the @ groups with regards to risk of reduction loss , the DSTS and LAC were comparable in maintenance of reduction at the time of cast removal .
CONCLUSIONS	Both the DSTS and LAC are appropriate immobilization devices for these pediatric fractures .
METHODS	Level II-prospective , comparative study .

BACKGROUND	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is one of the most common malignant tumours and is still associated with a poor prognosis in advanced disease .
BACKGROUND	To improve the standard therapy with gemcitabine , we initiated a prospective randomised phase-II trial with gemcitabine ( GEM ) versus gemcitabine plus sunitinib ( SUNGEM ) based on data of in vitro trials and phase-I data for the combination treatment .
BACKGROUND	The rational of adding sunitinib was its putative antiangiogenic mechanism of action .
METHODS	A total of @ eligible patients with locally advanced , unresectable or metastatic PDAC without previous system therapy were randomised to receive GEM at a dosage of @ mg/m ( @ ) d@ , @ , @ q@ versus a combination of SUNGEM at a dosage of GEM @ mg/m ( @ ) d@ +@ and sunitinib @mg p.o. d@-@ , q@d .
METHODS	The primary end-point was progression free survival ( PFS ) , secondary end-points were overall survival ( OS ) , toxicity and overall response rate ( ORR ) .
RESULTS	The confirmatory analysis of PFS was based on the intend-to-treat ( ITT ) population ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median PFS was @ weeks ( @ % confidence interval ( @ % - CI ) : @-@ @ weeks ) for GEM and @ weeks for SUNGEM ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ weeks ; p = @ one-sided log-rank ) .
RESULTS	The ORR was @ % ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ % ) for GEM and for @ % ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ % ) for SUNGEM ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median time to progression ( TTP ) was @ weeks ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ weeks ) for GEM and @ weeks ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ weeks ) for SUNGEM ( p = @ ; two-sided log-rank ) .
RESULTS	The median OS was @ weeks ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ weeks ) for the GEM arm and @ weeks ( @ % - CI : @-@ @ weeks ) for the SUNGEM ( p = @ , one-sided log-rank ) .
RESULTS	In regard to toxicities , suspected SAEs were reported in @ % in the GEM arm and @ % in the SUNGEM arm .
RESULTS	Grade @ and @ neutropenia was statistically significantly higher in the SUNGEM arm with @ % versus @ % in the GEM arm ( p = @ , two sided log-rank ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination SUNGEM was not sufficient superior in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC compared to GEM alone in regard to efficacy but was associated with more toxicity .

BACKGROUND	DHA is accumulated in the central nervous system ( CNS ) before birth and is involved in early developmental processes , such as neurite outgrowth and gene expression .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether fetal DHA insufficiency occurs and constrains CNS development in term gestation infants .
METHODS	A risk reduction model using a randomized prospective study of term gestation single birth healthy infants born to women ( n = @ ) given a placebo or @ mg/day DHA from @ wk gestation to delivery .
METHODS	Fetal DHA deficiency sufficient to constrain CNS development was assessed based on increased risk that infants in the placebo group would not achieve neurodevelopment scores in the top quartile of all infants in the study .
RESULTS	Infants in the placebo group were at increased risk of lower language development assessed as words understood ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) and produced ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) at @ mo , and words understood ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) and sentences produced ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) at @ mo using the McArthur Communicative Developmental Inventory ; receptive ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) and expressive language ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) at @ mo using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III ; and visual acuity ( OR @ , CL @-@ @ , P = @ ) at @ mo. .

BACKGROUND	Although screening , brief intervention , and referral to treatment ( SBIRT ) has shown promise for alcohol use , relatively little is known about its effectiveness for adult illicit drug use .
BACKGROUND	This randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of the SBIRT approach for outcomes related to drug use among patients visiting trauma and emergency departments ( EDs ) at two large , urban hospitals .
METHODS	A total of @ ED patients who admitted using illegal drugs in the past @days were recruited , consented , provided baseline measures of substance use and related problems measured with the Addiction Severity Index-Lite ( ASI-Lite ) , and then randomized to the Life Shift SBIRT intervention or to an attention-placebo control group focusing on driving and traffic safety ( Shift Gears ) .
METHODS	Both groups received a level of motivational intervention matched to their condition and risk level by trained paraprofessional health educators .
METHODS	Separate measurement technicians conducted face-to-face follow-ups at @months post-intervention and collected hair samples to confirm reports of abstinence from drug use .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure of the study was past @-day drug abstinence at @months post-intervention , as self-reported on the ASI-Lite .
RESULTS	Of @ participants , @ ( @ % ) completed follow-up .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in self-reported abstinence ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) for Life Shift and Shift Gears groups , respectively .
RESULTS	When results of hair analyses were applied , the abstinence rate was @ percent for Life Shift and @ percent for Shift Gears ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In an analysis in which results were imputed ( n = @ ) , there was no significant difference in the ASI-Lite drug use composite scores ( Life Shift +@ vs. Shift Gears +@ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this randomized controlled trial , there was no evidence of effectiveness of SBIRT on the primary drug use outcome .

OBJECTIVE	This study investigated inter-rater agreement ( IRA ) among EEG experts for the identification of electrographic seizures and periodic discharges ( PDs ) in continuous ICU EEG recordings .
METHODS	Eight board-certified EEG experts independently identified seizures and PDs in thirty @-h EEG segments which were selected from ICU EEG recordings collected from three medical centers .
METHODS	IRA was compared between seizure and PD identifications , as well as among rater groups that have passed an ICU EEG Certification Test , developed by the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium ( CCEMRC ) .
RESULTS	Both kappa and event-based IRA statistics showed higher mean values in identification of seizures compared to PDs ( k = @ vs. @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The group of rater pairs who had both passed the ICU EEG Certification Test had a significantly higher mean IRA in comparison to rater pairs in which neither had passed the test .
CONCLUSIONS	IRA among experts is significantly higher for identification of electrographic seizures compared to PDs .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional instruction , such as the training module and certification test developed by the CCEMRC , could enhance this IRA .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates more disagreement in the labeling of PDs in comparison to seizures .
CONCLUSIONS	This may be improved by education about standard EEG nomenclature .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate three different stabilization methods with regards to the amount of shrinkage in free gingival graft .
METHODS	Forty-five patients were included in three study groups : where stabilization was achieved with conventional technique , cyanoacrylate or microsurgery .
METHODS	In the conventional group standardized @-@ sutures were used .
METHODS	In the microsurgery group grafts were stabilized with @-@ sutures and loupe .
METHODS	In the third group , graft was stabilized with cyanoacrylate .
METHODS	Keratinized tissue width , graft area , gingival recession were calculated by a specific software on standard photographs at baseline , @ - , @ - , @-month follow-ups .
METHODS	Duration of surgery was also recorded .
METHODS	Pain in recipient and donor sites was assessed using visual analogue scale within the first postoperative week .
RESULTS	Change in keratinized tissue width was similar in the study groups at all times .
RESULTS	Graft shrinkage was significantly less ( p < @ ) in the cyanoacrylate group than the other groups , whereas those in the conventional and microsurgery groups were similar .
RESULTS	Significantly less pain in the recipient site was reported by the patients in the cyanoacrylate group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Duration of surgery was significantly less in the cyanoacrylate group than the other groups ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Less graft shrinkage in the free gingival graft , together with shorter surgery time and less pain in the recipient site obtained in the cyanoacrylate group , suggest that cyanoacrylate may be considered as an alternative for stabilization of free gingival grafts .

OBJECTIVE	ECAR ( Endovasculaire ou Chirurgie dans les Anvrysmes aorto-iliaques Rompus ) is a prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial including consecutive patients with ruptured aorto-iliac aneurysms ( rAIA ) eligible for treatment by either endovascular ( EVAR ) or open surgical repair ( OSR ) .
OBJECTIVE	Inclusion criteria were hemodynamic stability and computed tomography scan demonstrating aorto-iliac rupture .
METHODS	Randomization was done by week , synchronously in all centers .
METHODS	The primary end point was @ day mortality .
METHODS	Secondary end points were post-operative morbidity , length of stay in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) , amount of blood transfused ( units ) and @ month mortality .
RESULTS	From January @ to January @ , @ patients ( @ men , @ women ; median age @ years ) were enrolled in @ centers : @ ( @ % ) in the EVAR group and @ ( @ % ) in the OSR group .
RESULTS	The groups were similar in terms of age , sex , consciousness , systolic blood pressure , Hardman index , IGSII score , type of rupture , use of endoclamping balloon , and levels of troponin , creatinine , and hemoglobin .
RESULTS	Delay to treatment was higher in the EVAR group ( @ vs. @ hours ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Mortality at @ days and @ year were not different between the groups ( @ % in the EVAR group vs. @ % in the OSR group at @ days , and @ % vs. @ % , respectively , at @ year ) .
RESULTS	Total respiratory support time was lower in the EVAR group than in the OSR group ( @ hours vs. @ hours ; p = @ ) , as were pulmonary complications ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) , total blood transfusion ( @ vs. @ , respectively ; p = @ ) , and duration of ICU stay ( @ days vs. @ days , respectively ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , EVAR was found to be equal to OSR in terms of @ day and @ year mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	However , EVAR was associated with less severe complications and less consumption of hospital resources than OSR .

BACKGROUND	Interferon ( IFN ) - therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection is frequently associated with depression .
BACKGROUND	The routine prophylaxis with antidepressants might expose patients to adverse effects , hence , the need for alternative preventive interventions .
BACKGROUND	Omega-@ polyunsaturated fatty acids are safe and effective essential nutritional compounds used for the treatment of depression , putatively through an anti-inflammatory action .
BACKGROUND	In addition , lower erythrocyte levels of omega-@ polyunsaturated fatty acids have been associated with an increased risk of IFN-induced depression .
METHODS	We conducted a @-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial comparing eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , and placebo for the prevention of IFN -- induced depression .
METHODS	A total of @ patients consented to participate and were randomized to the study .
METHODS	All of the patients completed the @-week trial ; @ participants were followed throughout the @ weeks of IFN - treatment and were included in the analysis .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , the incident rates of IFN -- induced depression were significantly lower in EPA-treated but not in DHA-treated patients ( @ % and @ % , respectively , versus @ % for placebo , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both EPA and DHA significantly delayed the onset of IFN-induced depression ( week of onset : @ and @ , respectively , versus @ for placebo , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	EPA and DHA were both well tolerated in this population .
RESULTS	EPA treatment increased both EPA and DHA erythrocyte levels , but DHA only increased DHA erythrocyte levels .
CONCLUSIONS	EPA is effective in the prevention of depression in hepatitis C virus patients received IFN - therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study confirms the notion that anti-inflammatory strategies are effective antidepressants in the context of depression associated with inflammation .

BACKGROUND	Some children have residual amblyopia after treatment with atropine eyedrops for amblyopia due to strabismus and/or anisometropia .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of augmenting the effect of atropine by changing the lens over the fellow eye to plano in children with residual amblyopia .
METHODS	A total of @ children @ to < @ years of age ( mean , @ years ) with stable residual amblyopia ( range , @/@ to @/@ , mean @/@ ( +@ ) ) were enrolled after at least @ weeks of atropine treatment of the fellow eye .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to continuing weekend atropine alone or wearing a plano lens over the fellow eye ( while continuing atropine ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was assessed at @ weeks , and participants were followed until improvement ceased .
RESULTS	At the @-week primary outcome visit , amblyopic-eye visual acuity had improved an average of @ lines with the plano lens and @ lines with atropine only ( difference adjusted for baseline visual acuity = + @ line ; @ % CI , -@ to +@ ) .
RESULTS	At the primary outcome or later visit when the best-measured visual acuity was observed , the mean amblyopic-eye improvement from baseline was @ lines with the plano lens and @ lines with atropine only .
CONCLUSIONS	When amblyopic-eye visual acuity stops improving with atropine treatment , there may be a small benefit to augmenting atropine therapy with a plano lens over the fellow eye .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the effect was not statistically significant , and the large confidence interval raises the possibility of no benefit or a benefit larger than we observed .
CONCLUSIONS	A larger study would be necessary to get a more precise estimate of the treatment effect .

BACKGROUND	Few cancers pose greater challenges than head and neck ( H&N ) cancer .
BACKGROUND	Residual effects following treatment include body image changes , pain , fatigue and difficulties with appetite , swallowing and speech .
BACKGROUND	Depression is a common comorbidity .
BACKGROUND	There is limited evidence about ways to assist patients to achieve optimal adjustment after completion of treatment .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we aim to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of a model of survivorship care to improve the quality of life of patients who have completed treatment for H&N cancer .
METHODS	This is a preliminary study in which @ patients will be recruited .
METHODS	A prospective randomised controlled trial of the H&N Cancer Survivor Self-management Care Plan ( HNCP ) involving pre - and post-intervention assessments will be used .
METHODS	Consecutive patients who have completed a defined treatment protocol for H&N cancer will be recruited from two large cancer services and randomly allocated to one of three study arms : ( @ ) usual care , ( @ ) information in the form of a written resource or ( @ ) the HNCP delivered by an oncology nurse who has participated in manual-based training and skill development in patient self-management support .
METHODS	The trained nurses will meet patients in a face-to-face interview lasting up to @ minutes to develop an individualised HNCP , based on principles of chronic disease self-management .
METHODS	Participants will be assessed at baseline , @ and @ months .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure is quality of life .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measures include mood , self-efficacy and health-care utilisation .
METHODS	The feasibility of implementing this intervention in routine clinical care will be assessed through semistructured interviews with participating nurses , managers and administrators .
METHODS	Interviews with patients who received the HNCP will explore their perceptions of the HNCP , including factors that assisted them in achieving behavioural change .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , we aim to improve the quality of life of a patient population with unique needs by means of a tailored self-management care plan developed upon completion of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Delivery of the intervention by trained oncology nurses is likely to be acceptable to patients and , if successful , will be a model of care that can be implemented for diverse patient populations .

BACKGROUND	Dietary sodium restriction is a key management strategy in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .
BACKGROUND	Recent evidence has demonstrated short-term reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) and proteinuria with sodium restriction , however the effect on other cardiovascular-related risk factors requires investigation in CKD .
METHODS	The LowSALT CKD study involved @ hypertensive Stage III-IV CKD patients counselled by a dietitian to consume a low-sodium diet ( < @mmol/day ) .
METHODS	The study was a randomised crossover trial comparing @weeks of high-sodium ( additional @mmol sodium tablets ) and low-sodium intake ( placebo ) .
METHODS	Measurements were taken after each crossover arm including BP ( peripheral and central ) , adipokines ( inflammation markers and adiponectin ) , volume markers ( extracellular-to-intracellular -LSB- E/I -RSB- fluid ratio ; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide -LSB- NT-proBNP -RSB- ) , kidney function ( estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate -LSB- eGFR -RSB- ) and proteinuria ( urine protein-creatinine ratio -LSB- PCR -RSB- and albumin-creatinine ratio -LSB- ACR -RSB- ) .
METHODS	Outcomes were compared using paired t-test for each cross-over arm .
RESULTS	BP-lowering benefits of a low-sodium intake ( peripheral BP ( meanSD ) @/@/@mmHg ) from high-sodium ( @/@/@mmHg ) intake were reflected in central BP and a reduction in eGFR , PCR , ACR , NTproBNP and E/I ratio .
RESULTS	There was no change in inflammatory markers , total or high molecular weight adiponectin .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-term benefits of sodium restriction on BP were reflected in significant change in kidney function and fluid volume parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger , long-term adequately powered trials in CKD are necessary to confirm these results .

BACKGROUND	Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) is a standard treatment for gastric neoplasia limited to the mucosa without lymph node metastasis .
BACKGROUND	However , there are neither standardized guidelines nor studies on the best time to start oral intake after ESD .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare patient satisfaction , safety , length of hospital stay , and economic feasibility between an early post-ESD diet and the conventional immediate fasting protocol .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with @ gastric epithelial neoplasias who underwent ESD by a single expert endoscopist were consecutively and prospectively enrolled .
METHODS	Enrolled patients were randomized to an early diet group or a control group .
METHODS	The early diet group started meals as a clear liquid diet on day @ , and a soft diet and general diet in sequence on day @ .
METHODS	The fasting group was fasted for @ days .
METHODS	Patients in both groups underwent second-look endoscopy within @ days following ESD and follow-up endoscopy after @ months .
RESULTS	In the course of the study , ten patients were excluded .
RESULTS	The total number of patients in the early diet group and control group was @ and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	Mean age was @ years ( @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in clinicopathologic conditions or endoscopic results such as procedure time or size of lesions between the two groups .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in abdominal pain score , rate of post-ESD bleeding or healing rate of ESD-induced ulcer between the two groups .
RESULTS	However , the early diet protocol led to significantly higher patient satisfaction ( p = @ ) , lower hospital costs ( p < @ ) , and shorter hospital stay ( p < @ ) than the conventional fasting protocol .
CONCLUSIONS	An early post-ESD diet protocol provides higher patient satisfaction , is more cost effective , decreases hospital stay , and does not influence complication rates such as post-ESD bleeding , abdominal pain , or ulcer healing compared with the conventional fasting protocol .

BACKGROUND	Internet-based applications are becoming more common in our modern world .
BACKGROUND	While electronic health records ( EHR ) are available for patients and health care providers outside of Germany , most of the available data on EHR address only monetary advantages.This study explores whether or not internet-based communication between family physicians ( FP ) and patients is as safe as traditional oral communication and if it may lead to further benefits .
METHODS	@ patients from @ family doctors ' offices were included in this @ months RCT .
METHODS	Both groups were treated in the same manner by their respective physicians , but members of the study group ( SG ) were able to access an individual developed web-based software where they could view their diagnosis and medication , and send an electronic message to their doctors who would respond .
METHODS	Their satisfication with the FP , certain health data and the FP 's workload were recorded .
RESULTS	a ) Patients ' satisfaction : When e.g. asked about the organization of the family practice or trust in the doctor , there were no significant differences between the control ( CG ) and the SG ( p = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , patients of the SG felt better informed ( p = @ ) , and generally more satisfied with their FP ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	b ) FP workload : Members of the CG had @ contacts with their doctors during the study , while the SG only had @ recorded contacts ( including web-based contacts , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	It took physicians @:@ minutes less to read and respond to an electronic message than to see a patient during the consultation hours .
RESULTS	c ) Changes in patients ' health : During the study the blood pressure ( BP ) in the CG rose @ / @ mmHg , while it dropped @ / @ mmHg in the SG ( p = @ / @ ) .
RESULTS	The HbA ( @C ) dropped in both groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	One week after the first visit to the family doctor , patients of the SG rated their pain @ points lower on a VAS than the CG ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ % from the CG and @ % from the SG requested the re-prescription of long-term medication on time ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Using an optional web-based communication platform is as safe as traditional consultations can be .
CONCLUSIONS	Both patients and doctors may benefit from using the internet in this context .

BACKGROUND	Many transfusion services are keeping thawed plasma ( TP ) ready for trauma patients .
BACKGROUND	According to Chinese guidelines , once thawed , fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) should be used within @h .
BACKGROUND	This may increase plasma wastage and delay plasma administration to critical patients .
BACKGROUND	However , it can be avoided by being relabeled as TP .
BACKGROUND	In this study we evaluated coagulation-related proteins in thawed apheresis FFP during @ days of storage at @-@ C.
METHODS	Thirty apheresis fresh plasma units were aliquot and stored at -@ C. Aliquots were thawed at @ C and stored at @-@ C for @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @ days , respectively .
METHODS	Prothrombin time ( PT ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , thrombin time ( TT ) , fibrinogen ( Fbg ) , factor ( F ) II , FV , FVII , FVIII , FIX , FX , FXI , FXII , protein C ( PC ) , protein S ( PS ) , antithrombin III ( ATIII ) and ADAMTS@ levels were assessed at Days @-@ , respectively .
RESULTS	For @ days of refrigerated storage , no significant differences were observed in Fbg , PC , PS , ATIII and ADAMTS@ .
RESULTS	FII , FV , FVII , FVIII , FIX , FX , FXI and FXII declined significantly over time .
RESULTS	The storage presented major decrease for FVIII , with a drop of @ % .
RESULTS	However , at least @ % levels of all measured proteins were remained on Day @ , when compared to Day @ .
CONCLUSIONS	All measured proteins in TP for @ days of refrigerated storage were adequate .
CONCLUSIONS	These could provide evidence that thawed FFP could be relabeled as TP , which is a potential to ensure rapid plasma availability in emergency situations in China .

BACKGROUND	Potential benefits of single-port laparoscopic surgery may include improved cosmetic results , less postoperative pain , surgical trauma and faster recovery .
BACKGROUND	Results of randomized prospective studies with a focus on single-port rectal surgery have not yet been presented .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to compare single-port and conventional laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer in terms of short-term outcomes including postoperative pain and trauma-induced changes in certain bioactive substances .
METHODS	Patients with non-metastasized rectal cancer were prospectively randomized to single-port ( n = @ ) or conventional laparoscopic rectal surgery ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Postoperative pain was assessed at rest , at coughing and during mobilization , with a numeric pain ranking score and was recorded at @ h after the operation and subsequently every morning daily for @ days .
METHODS	Levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-@ ( TIMP-@ ) were determined .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected preoperatively ( baseline ) , and @ , @ , @ , @ and @ h after skin incision .
RESULTS	Pain scores were significantly reduced in the single-port group on postoperative days @ , @ and @ during coughing and mobilization .
RESULTS	In addition , the patients in the single-port group suffered significantly less pain at rest at @ h after surgery and on postoperative days @ , @ and @ .
RESULTS	The levels of the three markers increased significantly after surgery .
RESULTS	The increase was similar between groups for plasma IL-@ and TIMP-@ at all time points , while the CRP levels were significantly lower in the single-port group at @ ( p < @ ) and @ h ( p < @ ) after skin incision .
RESULTS	Abdominal incisions lengths were significantly shorter in the single-port group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between groups in operating time and blood loss , morbidity or mortality rate .
RESULTS	The short-term oncological outcome in the two groups was similar .
CONCLUSIONS	Single-port rectal surgery may reduce postoperative pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Although CRP levels were lower at some time points , results of the present randomized , pilot study suggest that the trauma-induced inflammatory response of single-port operations may be similar to the trauma-induced inflammatory response of conventional laparoscopic surgery .

OBJECTIVE	To compare in dual-energy CT ( DECT ) conventionally reconstructed polyenergetic images ( PEI ) at @ kVp to virtual monoenergetic images ( MEI ) at different kiloelectron volt ( keV ) levels for evaluation of liver and gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) hepatic metastases with regard to objective ( IQob ) and subjective image quality ( IQsub ) assessed by two readers of varying experience .
OBJECTIVE	Image quality was correlated to patient size and compared between PEI and MEI .
METHODS	From @ examinations of @ GIST patients ( @ with hepatic metastases ) undergoing abdominal dual-source DECT for staging , therapy monitoring or follow-up , PEI and nine MEI in @-keV intervals from @ to @ keV were reconstructed .
METHODS	Liver contrast-to-noise ratios ( CNR ) and metastasis-to-liver ratios were calculated .
METHODS	MEI reconstructions with the highest IQob were compared to PEI for IQsub by one experienced reader ( ER ) and one inexperienced reader ( IR ) .
METHODS	Patients ' diameters were correlated to IQob and IQsub ratings .
RESULTS	MEI at @ keV had the highest IQob with equal liver CNR and metastasis-to-liver ratio compared to PEI .
RESULTS	The ER rated @-keV MEI and PEI equally high ( median @ ) , whereas the IR rated IQsub best in @-keV MEI ( median @ ) .
RESULTS	Unlike in PEI , IQsub ratings in @-keV MEI were not correlated to patient size .
CONCLUSIONS	MEI at @ keV provided an IQob equivalent to PEI .
CONCLUSIONS	Regarding the IR , IQsub was improved in @-keV MEI compared to PEI and less dependent on patient size .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , IRs might improve their diagnostic confidence in the assessment of hepatic GIST metastases by evaluating MEI reconstructions at @ keV .

OBJECTIVE	Current stroke risk schemes need improvement of predictive value in patients with atrial fibrillation .
OBJECTIVE	Transoesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) may facilitate stroke risk assessment in such patients and guide antithrombotic treatment .
METHODS	We randomised @ patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a moderate stroke risk to aspirin or adjusted vitamin K antagonist therapy after TEE had ruled out thrombogenic features in the atria and aorta .
METHODS	The primary outcome was a composite of stroke , major bleeding , peripheral embolism and all-cause mortality .
RESULTS	Mean CHA@DS@-VASc score was @ .
RESULTS	The incidences of the composite primary outcome at a mean follow-up of @ years were @ % ( @ % per year ) in the aspirin group compared to @ % ( @ % per year ) in the vitamin K antagonists group with an absolute advantage of @ percentage points .
RESULTS	Aspirin was non-inferior to vitamin K antagonists ( p < @ ) because the upper limit of the @ % CI did not exceed the @ % absolute difference in event rate between the two treatment arms .
CONCLUSIONS	This hypothesis-generating pilot trial has found that TEE may be used for refinement of stroke risk in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients .
CONCLUSIONS	A larger trial is needed to confirm these data .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov number NTC@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Insecticide-treated nets ( ITNs ) and indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) of houses provide effective malaria transmission control .
BACKGROUND	There is conflicting evidence about whether it is more beneficial to provide both interventions in combination .
BACKGROUND	A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether the combination provides added protection compared to ITNs alone .
RESULTS	In northwest Tanzania , @ clusters ( village areas ) were randomly allocated to ITNs only or ITNs and IRS .
RESULTS	Dwellings in the ITN+IRS arm were sprayed with two rounds of bendiocarb in @ .
RESULTS	Plasmodium falciparum prevalence rate ( PfPR ) in children @-@ y old ( primary outcome ) and anaemia in children < @ y old ( secondary outcome ) were compared between study arms using three cross-sectional household surveys in @ .
RESULTS	Entomological inoculation rate ( secondary outcome ) was compared between study arms .
RESULTS	IRS coverage was approximately @ % .
RESULTS	ITN use ranged from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	In intention-to-treat analysis , mean PfPR was @ % in the ITN+IRS arm and @ % in the ITN only arm , odds ratio = @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ , n = @,@ ) .
RESULTS	The strongest effect was observed in the peak transmission season , @ mo after the first IRS .
RESULTS	Subgroup analysis showed that ITN users were additionally protected if their houses were sprayed .
RESULTS	Mean monthly entomological inoculation rate was non-significantly lower in the ITN+IRS arm than in the ITN only arm , rate ratio = @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomised trial to our knowledge that reports significant added protection from combining IRS and ITNs compared to ITNs alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect is likely to be attributable to IRS providing added protection to ITN users as well as compensating for inadequate ITN use .
CONCLUSIONS	Policy makers should consider deploying IRS in combination with ITNs to control transmission if local ITN strategies on their own are insufficiently effective .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the uncertain generalisability of these findings , it would be prudent for malaria control programmes to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deploying the combination .

OBJECTIVE	The OPTION ( Optimal Anti-Tachycardia Therapy in Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Patients Without Pacing Indications ) trial sought to compare long-term rates of inappropriate shocks , mortality , and morbidity between dual-chamber and single-chamber settings in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) patients .
BACKGROUND	The use of dual-chamber ICDs potentially allows better discrimination of supraventricular arrhythmias and thereby reduces inappropriate shocks .
BACKGROUND	However , it may lead to detrimental ventricular pacing .
METHODS	This prospective multicenter , single-blinded trial enrolled @ patients with de novo primary or secondary prevention indications for ICD placement and with left ventricular ejection fractions @ % despite optimal tolerated pharmacotherapy .
METHODS	All patients received atrial leads and dual-chamber defibrillators that were randomized to be programmed either with dual-chamber or single-chamber settings .
METHODS	In the dual-chamber setting arm , the PARAD + algorithm , which differentiates supraventricular from ventricular arrhythmias , and SafeR mode , to minimize ventricular pacing , were activated .
METHODS	In the single-chamber setting arm , the acceleration , stability , and long cycle search discrimination criteria were activated , and pacing was set to VVI @ beats/min .
METHODS	Ventricular tachycardia detection was required at rates between @ and @ beats/min , and ventricular fibrillation detection was activated above @ beats/min .
RESULTS	During a follow-up period of @ months , the time to the first inappropriate shock was significantly longer in the dual-chamber setting arm ( p = @ , log-rank test ) , and @ % of patients in the dual-chamber setting group compared with @ % in the single-chamber setting group experienced inappropriate shocks ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Rates of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization were @ % for the dual-chamber setting group and @ % for the single-chamber setting group and satisfied the pre-defined margin for equivalence ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Therapy with dual-chamber settings for ICD discrimination combined with algorithms for minimizing ventricular pacing was associated with reduced risk for inappropriate shock compared with single-chamber settings , without increases in mortality and morbidity .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes in the treatment of deep non-contained intrabony defects ( i.e. , with @ % @-wall component and a residual @ - to @-wall component in the most apical part ) using deproteinized bovine bone mineral ( DBBM ) combined with either enamel matrix protein derivative ( EMD ) or collagen membrane ( CM ) .
METHODS	Forty patients with multiple intrabony defects were enrolled .
METHODS	Only one non-contained defect per patient with an intrabony depth @ mm located in the interproximal area of single - and multirooted teeth was randomly assigned to the treatment with either EMD + DBBM ( test : n = @ ) or CM + DBBM ( control : n = @ ) .
METHODS	At baseline and after @ months , clinical parameters including probing depth ( PD ) and clinical attachment level ( CAL ) were recorded .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was the change in CAL between baseline and @ months .
RESULTS	At baseline , the intrabony component of the defects amounted to @ @ mm for EMD + DBBM and @ @ mm for CM + DBBM sites ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean CAL gain at sites treated with EMD + DBBM was not statistically significantly different ( P = @ ) compared with CM + DBBM ( @ @ versus @ @ mm ) .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) was observed comparing the frequency of CAL gain @ mm between EMD + DBBM ( @ % ) and CM + DBBM ( @ % ) or comparing the frequency of residual PD @ mm between EMD + DBBM ( @ % ) and CM + DBBM ( @ % ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Within the limitations of the present study , regenerative therapy using either EMD + DBBM or CM + DBBM yielded comparable clinical outcomes in deep non-contained intrabony defects after @ months .

BACKGROUND	Cardiac surgery and sternotomy are procedures accompanied by substantial postoperative pain which is challenging to treat .
BACKGROUND	In general , intravenous ( IV ) opioids are used in the immediate postoperative phase , followed by oral opioids .
BACKGROUND	Oral opioids are easier to use and generally less expensive .
BACKGROUND	Our goal was thus to determine whether a new opioid preparation provides adequate analgesia after sternotomy .
BACKGROUND	In particular , we tested the primary hypothesis that total opioid use ( in morphine equivalents ) is not greater with oral opioid compared with patient-controlled IV morphine .
BACKGROUND	Our secondary hypothesis was that analgesic efficacy is similar with oral and IV opioids .
METHODS	A total of @ patients having elective cardiac surgery were enrolled in this study .
METHODS	After rapid postoperative respiratory weaning , the patients were randomised into one of two groups receiving different types of analgesia : oral Targin ( a combination of oxycodone-hydrochloride and the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride-dihydrate ) or patient-controlled IV morphine .
METHODS	Pain score ( visual analogue scale ) , sedation ( Ramsey score ) , respiratory rate and side effects were assessed at @ , @ , @ , @ and @ h after surgery , and every @ h throughout the third postoperative evening .
RESULTS	The total opioid dose in morphine equivalent doses was significantly lower with oral opioid than with IV morphine ( adjusted geometric means -LSB- @ % confidence interval -RSB- : @ -LSB- @ ; @ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @ ; @ -RSB- mg , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Pain scores were similar in each group .
CONCLUSIONS	Analgesic quality was comparable with oral and IV opioids , suggesting that postoperative pain even after very painful procedures can be sufficiently managed with oral opioids .

OBJECTIVE	To compare subjective and objective visual performance of the Air Optix Aqua Multifocal lens to monovision in a group of subjects requiring a medium level of reading-addition power .
METHODS	Fifty participants with reading additions between @ and @ diopters ( inclusive ) were randomized into a prospective , crossover clinical trial .
METHODS	They wore monovision and multifocals for @ weeks in a randomized order .
METHODS	High - and low-contrast logMAR ( logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ) acuity and stereopsis were measured at the beginning and end of each period .
METHODS	During each phase , participants performed specific tasks followed by subjective rating surveys and also completed satisfaction rating surveys on days @ , @ , and @ ; all were transferred in real time using BlackBerry smartphones .
METHODS	A general rating survey was completed at the dispensing and @-week visits .
RESULTS	Forty-nine participants completed the study ( mean age , @ years ) .
RESULTS	Distance and near high - and low-contrast acuities were significantly better ( p < @ ) with monovision at all visits .
RESULTS	High-contrast intermediate acuity was only better ( p < @ ) with multifocals after @ weeks .
RESULTS	Stereopsis was equivalent after @ weeks , but better ( p < @ ) with multifocals at dispensing .
RESULTS	Subjective ratings were generally equivalent between modalities although there was a trend for multifocals to be rated higher for focus changing and driving , whereas monovision tended to be rated higher for near tasks .
RESULTS	For both corrections , the satisfaction survey showed no significant change between days @ , @ , and @ , and the general survey showed that comfort was maintained but subjective vision ratings decreased significantly over the @ weeks .
RESULTS	Twenty-five participants ( @ % ) preferred multifocals , @ ( @ % ) preferred monovision , and the remaining @ ( @ % ) declared both unacceptable .
CONCLUSIONS	In this cohort , distance and near acuities were better with monovision , whereas the subjective ratings tended to favor the Air Optix Aqua Multifocal , with the exception of near performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Preference was statistically similar between both corrections , with a trend toward preferring the multifocal .

BACKGROUND	Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) is the consequence of further development of minimally invasive surgery to reduce abdominal incisions and surgical trauma .
BACKGROUND	The potential benefits are expected to be less postoperative pain , faster convalescence , and reduced risk for incisional hernias and wound infections compared to conventional methods .
BACKGROUND	Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of transvaginal NOTES , and transvaginal access is currently the most frequent clinically applied route for NOTES procedures .
BACKGROUND	However , despite increasing clinical application , no firm clinical evidence is available for objective assessment of the potential benefits and risks of transvaginal NOTES compared to the current surgical standard .
METHODS	The TRANSVERSAL trial is designed as a randomized controlled trial to compare transvaginal hybrid NOTES and laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection .
METHODS	Female patients referred to elective sigmoid resection due to complicated or reoccurring diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon are considered eligible .

BACKGROUND	Highly HLA-sensitized ( HS ) patients have difficulty accessing compatible donors , especially deceased donor ( DD ) transplants .
BACKGROUND	Desensitization protocols ( DES ) have evolved , but rigorous evaluation is lacking .
BACKGROUND	Here , we examined the efficacy of rituximab as a DES agent in a placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Candidates were randomized to IVIG + placebo versus IVIG + rituximab .
METHODS	End points included rates of transplantation , antibody-mediated rejection ( ABMR ) , and renal function .
METHODS	Protocol biopsies were performed at @ year and analysis of patient and graft survival and donor-specific HLA antibodies ( DSA ) were performed .
RESULTS	Initially , @ HS DDs were randomized with @ receiving transplants .
RESULTS	However , we discontinued study entry after five serious adverse events were observed .
RESULTS	The study was un-blinded and attribution of patients was noted ( IVIG + placebo N = @ , IVIG + rituximab N = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were seen in DSA levels at transplant .
RESULTS	All ABMR episodes occurred in the IVIG + placebo arm and required intense therapy ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The two graft losses were in the placebo group .
RESULTS	DSA rebound associated with severe ABMR was seen in three patients in the IVIG + placebo group .
RESULTS	No rebound was seen in the IVIG + rituximab group .
RESULTS	Renal function at @ and @ months showed a significant benefit for IVIG + rituximab ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on limited assessment with acknowledged limitations , both protocols appear effective in achieving levels of DSA allowable for transplantation .
CONCLUSIONS	However , IVIG + rituximab appeared more effective in preventing DSA rebound and , more importantly , preventing ABMR and development of transplant glomerulopathy .

BACKGROUND	Survival rates after sudden cardiac arrest could be increased if bystanders could be encouraged to perform CPR until emergency services arrive .
BACKGROUND	This should be initiated by the dispatcher at the emergency control facility who receives the call .
BACKGROUND	For the first time the ERC guidelines of @ included instructions to be given to untrained rescuers by the dispatcher .
BACKGROUND	Rapid recognition of cardiac arrest and initiation of emergency measures is assured by means of specific training for the dispatchers .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the time between an emergency call and beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) could be shortened using a simple protocol and whether a relationship exists between the intensity of phone contact between dispatcher and caller and if this improves the results .
METHODS	In known cases of unconsciousness , group @ ( @ persons ) received short CPR instructions via the phone , where the dispatcher was on the phone for continuous advice until emergency services arrived .
METHODS	Group @ ( @ persons ) received identical phone instructions like group @ , but the phone call was terminated by the dispatcher after the information was provided .
METHODS	Group @ ( @ persons ) only received instructions to start CPR .
RESULTS	On average , all test persons in group @ started reanimation after @ s , in group @ after @ s , and in group @ after @ s.
RESULTS	The compression frequency on average was @ / min in group @ , @ / min in group @ , and @ / min in group @ ; therefore , all groups reached an average frequency of > @/min .
RESULTS	The correct compression depth was achieved by @ % of test persons in group @ , by @ % in group @ , and by @ % in group @ .
RESULTS	All volunteers felt well supported .
RESULTS	Of the @ people , @ did not feel that they were missing instructions .
CONCLUSIONS	There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the target variables .
CONCLUSIONS	The results show that already extremely short instructions or advice by the dispatcher to start CPR is sufficient to encourage bystanders to give assistance in an emergency .

BACKGROUND	Treatments of eating disorders result too often in partial psychological and physical remission , chronicization , dropout , relapse and death , with no fully known explanations for this failure .
BACKGROUND	In order to clarify this problem , we conducted three studies to identify the biochemical background of cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy ( CBT ) , individual psychology brief psychotherapy ( IBPP ) , and psychotherapy-pharmacotherapy with CBT + olanzapine in anorexics ( AN ) and bulimics ( BN ) by measuring the levels of plasma homovanillic acid ( HVA ) for dopamine secretion , plasma @-methoxy-@-hydroxy-phenylglycol ( MHPG ) for noradrenalin secretion , and platelet -LSB- @H -RSB- - Paroxetin-binding Bmax and Kd for serotonin transporter function .
BACKGROUND	The data were then compared with psychopathological and physical alterations .
METHODS	Study @ investigated the effects of @ months of CBT on plasma HVA , MHPG and -LSB- @H -RSB- - Par-binding in @ AN-restricted , @ AN-bingeing/purging , and @ BN inpatients .
METHODS	Study @ investigated the effects of @ months of IBPP on plasma HVA in @ AN and @ BN outpatients .
METHODS	Study @ investigated the effect of @ months of CBT + olanzapine ( @ mg/day ) in @ AN outpatients .
METHODS	The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA for repeated measures for the changes between basal and post-treatment biological and psychological parameters , two-way ANOVA for repeated measures for the differences in the psychobiological data in the @ groups , Spearman 's test for the correlations between basal and final changes in the psychological and biological scores .
RESULTS	Study @ revealed significant amelioration of the psychopathology in the AN and BN patients , no effects on HVA , MHPG or Paroxetin binding Kd , and a significant increase in Par-binding Bmax only in the BN patients .
RESULTS	Study @ revealed a significant effect of IBPP on psychopathology in the AN and BN patients , and a significant increase in HVA only in the BN patients .
RESULTS	Study @ revealed a significant positive effect of CBT + olanzapine therapy on the psychopathology and increased HVA values .
RESULTS	No correlations were observed in the @ groups between biological and psychological effects of the three treatments .

OBJECTIVE	This study explored the interest in genomic testing for modest changes in colorectal cancer risk and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications among individuals with intermediate disease risk due to a family history of colorectal cancer .
METHODS	Surveys were conducted on @ men and women at intermediate risk for colorectal cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a remote personalized risk communication intervention ( TeleCARE ) aimed at promoting colonoscopy to a generic print control condition .
METHODS	Guided by Leventhal 's Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation , we examined demographic and psychosocial factors possibly associated with interest in SNP testing .
METHODS	Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with interest in SNP testing and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications .
RESULTS	Three-fourths of participants expressed interest in SNP testing for colorectal cancer risk .
RESULTS	Testing interest did not markedly change across behavior modifier scenarios .
RESULTS	Participants preferred to receive genomic risk communications from a variety of sources : printed materials ( @ % ) , oncologists ( @ % ) , primary-care physicians ( @ % ) , and the web ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Overall , persons who were unmarried ( p = @ ) , younger ( p = @ ) and with greater cancer-related fear ( p = @ ) were more likely to express interest in predictive genomic testing for colorectal cancer risk .
RESULTS	In a stratified analysis , cancer-related fear was associated with the interest in predictive genomic testing in the intervention group ( p = @ ) , but not the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	Individuals with intermediate familial risk for colorectal cancer are highly interested in genomic testing for modest increases in disease risk , specifically unmarried persons , younger age groups and those with greater cancer fear .

BACKGROUND	Despite effective treatments to reduce cardiovascular disease risk , their translation into practice is limited .
RESULTS	Using a parallel arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in @ Australian primary healthcare centers , we tested whether a multifaceted quality improvement intervention comprising computerized decision support , audit/feedback tools , and staff training improved ( @ ) guideline-indicated risk factor measurements and ( @ ) guideline-indicated medications for those at high cardiovascular disease risk .
RESULTS	Centers had to use a compatible software system , and eligible patients were regular attendees ( Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged @ years and others aged @ years ) .
RESULTS	Patient-level analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering .
RESULTS	Median follow-up for @,@ patients ( mean age , @ years ; @ % men ) was @ months .
RESULTS	Mean monthly staff support was < @ hour/site .
RESULTS	For the coprimary outcomes , the intervention was associated with improved overall risk factor measurements ( @ % versus @ % risk ratio ; @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , but there was no significant differences in recommended prescriptions for the high-risk cohort ( n = @,@ ; @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were significant treatment escalations ( new prescriptions or increased numbers of medicines ) for antiplatelet ( @ % versus @ % ; P < @ ) , lipid-lowering ( @ % versus @ % ; P < @ ) , and blood pressure-lowering medications ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In Australian primary healthcare settings , a computer-guided quality improvement intervention , requiring minimal support , improved cardiovascular disease risk measurement but did not increase prescription rates in the high-risk group .
CONCLUSIONS	Computerized quality improvement tools offer an important , albeit partial , solution to improving primary healthcare system capacity for cardiovascular disease risk management .

BACKGROUND	The Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa ( CAPRISA ) @ trial demonstrated a @ % reduction in HIV infection , with a @ % HIV reduction in women who used tenofovir gel consistently .
BACKGROUND	A confirmatory trial is expected to report results in early @ .
BACKGROUND	In the interim , we have a unique window of opportunity to prepare for and devise effective strategies for the future policy and programmatic scale-up of tenofovir gel provision .
BACKGROUND	One approach is to integrate tenofovir gel provision into family planning ( FP ) services .
BACKGROUND	The CAPRISA @ implementation trial provides an opportunity to provide post-trial access to tenofovir gel while generating empiric evidence to assess whether integrating tenofovir gel provision into routine FP services can achieve similar levels of adherence as the CAPRISA @ trial .
METHODS	This is a two-arm , open-label , randomized controlled non-inferiority trial .
METHODS	A maximum of @ sexually active , HIV-uninfected women aged @ years and older who previously participated in an antiretroviral prevention study will be enrolled from an urban and rural site in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa .
METHODS	The anticipated study duration is @ months , with active accrual requiring approximately @ months ( following which an open cohort will be maintained ) and follow-up continuing for approximately @ months .
METHODS	At each of the two sites , eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive tenofovir gel through either FP services ( intervention arm ) or through the CAPRISA research clinics ( control arm ) .
METHODS	As part of the study intervention , a quality improvement approach will be used to assist the FP services to expand their current services to include tenofovir gel provision .
CONCLUSIONS	This protocol aims to address an important implementation question on whether FP services are able to effectively incorporate tenofovir gel provision for this at-risk group of women in South Africa .
CONCLUSIONS	Provision of tenofovir gel to the women from the CAPRISA @ trial meets the ethical obligation for post-trial access , and helps identify a potential avenue for future scale-up of microbicides within the public health system of South Africa .

BACKGROUND	Food residue in the remnant stomach after subtotal gastrectomy ( STG ) interferes with endoscopic observation .
BACKGROUND	We investigated whether intravenous erythromycin improves gastric mucosa visualization in patients with STG .
METHODS	This study was conducted from April @ to October @ as a double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized trial .
METHODS	Patients who received STG with complete resection ( stage T@-@N@M@ ) were included .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus , neurologic disease , myopathy , recent viral enteritis history , concomitant therapy influencing gastrointestinal motility and severe comorbidity .
METHODS	Patients were instructed to consume a soft diet for dinner between @ and @ h , and endoscopies were performed between @ and @ h. Patients were assigned randomly to receive either erythromycin ( @ mg in normal saline @ cc ) or placebo saline .
METHODS	The endoscopy was performed @ min after infusion .
METHODS	Grade of residual food was rated as follows : G@ , no residual food ; G@ , a small amount of residual food ; G@ , a moderate amount of residual food ; G@ , a moderate amount of residual food that hinders observation of the entire surface , even with body rolling ; G@ , a great amount of residual food such that endoscopic observation is impossible .
RESULTS	When good visibility was defined as G@ + G@ , visibility was significantly better in the erythromycin group ( @ + @ % ) than in the placebo group ( @ + @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , this effect was not seen in patients within @ months after gastrectomy .
RESULTS	The risk factor for food stasis in the placebo group ( n = @ ) was food stasis at last endoscopy .
RESULTS	The only factor predicting erythromycin response in the erythromycin group ( n = @ ) was elapsed time since surgery .
RESULTS	Adverse effects included nausea -LSB- @ ( @ % ) -RSB- and vomiting -LSB- @ ( @ % ) -RSB- in the erythromycin group and vomiting -LSB- @ ( @ % ) -RSB- in the placebo group .
RESULTS	However , they were transient and tolerable .
CONCLUSIONS	Premedication with erythromycin improves mucosal visualization during endoscopy in patients with STG .

METHODS	One hundred and sixteen intubated and ventilated burn patients with confirmed inhalation trauma are randomized to nebulizations of heparin ( the nebulized heparin strategy ) or nebulizations of normal saline ( the control strategy ) every four hours for @days or until extubation , whichever comes first .
METHODS	The primary endpoint is the number of ventilator-free days , defined as days alive and breathing without assistance during the first @days , if the period of unassisted breathing lasts for at least @ consecutive hours .
CONCLUSIONS	As far as the authors know , HEPBURN is the first randomized , placebo-controlled trial , powered to investigate whether local treatment with heparin shortens duration of ventilation of intubated and ventilated burn patients with inhalation trauma .

OBJECTIVE	People are now living longer , but disability may affect the quality of those additional years of life .
OBJECTIVE	We undertook a trial to assess whether case finding reduces disability among older primary care patients .
METHODS	We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of the Brief Risk Identification Geriatric Health Tool ( BRIGHT ) among @ primary care practices in New Zealand , assigning them to an intervention or control group .
METHODS	Intervention practices sent a BRIGHT screening tool to older adults every birthday ; those with a score of @ or higher were referred to regional geriatric services for assessment and , if needed , service provision .
METHODS	Control practices provided usual care .
METHODS	Main outcomes , assessed in blinded fashion , were residential care placement and hospitalization , and secondary outcomes were disability , assessed with Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale ( NEADL ) , and quality of life , assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale , abbreviated version ( WHOQOL-BREF ) .
RESULTS	All @,@ community-dwelling patients aged @ years and older were approached ; @,@ ( @ % ) participated , of whom @,@ ( @ % ) completed the trial .
RESULTS	Their mean age was @ ( SD @ ) years , and @ % were women .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % of the intervention group returned a BRIGHT tool ; @ patients were referred .
RESULTS	After @ months , patients in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to have been placed in residential care : @ % vs @ % ( hazard ratio = @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Intervention patients had smaller declines in mean scores for physical health-related quality of life ( @ vs @ points , P = @ ) and psychological health-related quality of life ( @ vs @ points , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Hospitalization , disability , and use of services did not differ between groups , however .
CONCLUSIONS	Our case-finding strategy was effective in increasing identification of older adults with disability , but there was little evidence of improved outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research could trial stronger primary care integration strategies .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of intensive atorvastatin therapy on programmed cell death @ ( PDCD@ ) expression by CD@ + T lymphocytes in patients with unstable angina who received percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
METHODS	Patients with unstable angina were randomized to pretreatment with either an intensive dose ( @ mg/day , n = @ ) or a conventional dose ( @ mg/day , n = @ ) of atorvastatin .
METHODS	Circulating CD@ + T cells were subsequently obtained prior to PCI , and also @-@ h after PCI , using a magnetic cell sorting system .
METHODS	Fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR was then used to measure levels of PDCD@ mRNA in the isolated CD@ + T lymphocytes , and Western blot analysis was used to detect levels of PDCD@ .
METHODS	Serum levels of interleukin ( IL ) -@ and TNF - were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients with unstable angina that were examined , levels of PDCD@ mRNA and protein were found to dramatically decrease in patients who received an intensive dose of atorvastatin following PCI ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , serum levels of TNF - significantly increased following PCI in both the intensive dose group and the conventional dose group , with the latter being higher than the former ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum IL-@ levels also markedly increased following PCI for the two groups .
RESULTS	However , higher values were associated with the intensive dose group ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intensive atorvastatin treatment reduced the post-PCI myocardial inflammatory response in patients with unstable angina , possibly by inhibiting PDCD@ expression in CD@ + T lymphocytes .

OBJECTIVE	A randomized and double-blinded study design was implemented to assess the stereo-acuity in patients symmetrically implanted with four types of multifocal intraocular lenses ( MIOLs ) , compared to a monofocal lens ( control group ) .
OBJECTIVE	In addition , the influence of the type of test employed for the evaluation of stereo-acuity was explored .
METHODS	Six months after cataract intervention , stereo-acuity was measured with the Titmus and TNO stereotests in @ patients implanted with one of the following MIOL lens types : hybrid spherical SN@D@ , hybrid aspheric SN@AD@ , diffractive aspheric ZMA@ and refractive spherical NXG@ .
METHODS	A control group implanted with the monofocal aspheric ZA@ ( in which stereo-acuity was measured with a near addition ) was also included in the study .
RESULTS	Statistically significant better stereo-acuity was found in the monofocal group with both stereotests ( except for the SN@D@ group with the Titmus test ) ( all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences in stereo-acuity between MIOLs were found using the Titmus test .
RESULTS	However , with the TNO , patients implanted with hybrid diffractive MIOLs exhibited statistically significant worse stereo-acuity than those with the refractive design ( SN@D@ , p < @ ; SN@AD@ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients implanted with MIOLs have worse stereo-acuity than those implanted with monofocal IOLs due to the decrease in retinal image contrast originating in the simultaneous presence of two images .
CONCLUSIONS	A wavelength-based stereotest such as the TNO induces large differences in image contrast between fellow eyes implanted with diffractive-based MIOLs , which may result in an underestimation of the real stereo-acuity of the patient .

BACKGROUND	The effectiveness and durability of endovascular revascularization therapies for chronic critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) are challenged by the extensive burden of infrapopliteal arterial disease and lesion-related characteristics ( e.g. , severe calcification , chronic total occlusions ) , which frequently result in poor clinical outcomes .
BACKGROUND	While infrapopliteal vessel patency directly affects pain relief and wound healing , sustained patency and extravascular care both contribute to the ultimate `` patient-centric '' outcomes of functional limb preservation , mobility and quality of life ( QoL ) .
METHODS	IN.PACT DEEP is a @:@ randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of infrapopliteal arterial revascularization between the IN.PACT Amphirion paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon ( IA-DEB ) and standard balloon angioplasty ( PTA ) in patients with Rutherford Class @-@-@ CLI .
CONCLUSIONS	This multicenter trial has enrolled @ patients at @ European centers with independent angiographic core lab adjudication of the primary efficacy endpoint of target lesion late luminal loss ( LLL ) and clinically driven target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) in major amputation-free surviving patients through @-months .
CONCLUSIONS	An independent wound core lab will evaluate all ischemic wounds to assess the extent of healing and time to healing at @ , @ , and @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	A QoL questionnaire including a pain scale will assess changes from baseline scores through @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	A Clinical Events Committee and Data Safety Monitoring Board will adjudicate the composite primary safety endpoints of all-cause death , major amputation , and clinically driven TLR at @ months and other trial endpoints and supervise patient safety throughout the study .
CONCLUSIONS	All patients will be followed for @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	A literature review is presented of the current status of endovascular treatment of CLI with drug-eluting balloon and standard PTA .
CONCLUSIONS	The rationale and design of the IN.PACT DEEP Trial are discussed .
CONCLUSIONS	IN.PACT DEEP is a milestone , prospective , randomized , robust , independent core lab-adjudicated CLI trial that will evaluate the role of a new infrapopliteal revascularization technology , the IA-DEB , compared to PTA .
CONCLUSIONS	It will assess the overall impact on infrapopliteal artery patency , limb salvage , wound healing , pain control , QoL , and patient mobility .
CONCLUSIONS	The @-year results of the adjudicated co-primary and secondary endpoints will be available in @ .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy and safety of adjusting the doses of diuretics of different time in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis ascites .
METHODS	A total of @ advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group ( @ cases each ) .
METHODS	The patients in the observation group received spironolactone and furosemide , and the first doses were @ mg/d and @ mg/d , respectively .
METHODS	If the efficacy was poor , according to the first doses of the standard increments once every four days , the doses gradually increased to the maximum doses of spironolactone @ mg/d and furosemide @ mg/d , respectively .
METHODS	The patients in the control group received spironolactone and furosemide , and the first doses were the same as those of the observation group .
METHODS	If the efficacy was poor , according to the first doses of the standard increments once every seven days , the doses gradually increased to the maximum doses as those of the observation group .
METHODS	Other conventional treatments were the same in both groups .
RESULTS	In both groups , the reductions of the total amount of the weight were ( @ + / - @ ) kg and ( @ + / - @ ) kg respectively ; the time of efficacy beginning was ( @ + / - @ ) days and ( @ + / - @ ) days respectively ; the average daily amounts of weight loss were ( @ + / - @ ) kg and ( @ + / - @ ) kg respectively ; the efficient rates were @ % and @ % respectively ; and there were no significant differences between the two group ( all P > @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the time of reduction from moderate ascites to mild ascites was ( @ + / - @ ) days ( @-@ days ) in the observation group and the time was ( @ + / - @ ) days ( @-@ days ) in the control group ( u = @ , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The therapy of diuretic doses adjusted by a four-day cycle is more useful for advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites .

BACKGROUND	Preclinical studies suggest that stress potentiates cue-induced cocaine seeking and that this effect is more pronounced in females .
BACKGROUND	These findings have not been characterized in clinical populations .
OBJECTIVE	The objectives of this study were to examine the impact a pharmacological stressor , alpha-@ adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine , on the subjective , endocrine , and physiologic responses to drug-paired cues cocaine-dependent men and women .
METHODS	In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study , cocaine-dependent men ( n = @ ) , cocaine-dependent women ( n = @ ) , control men ( n = @ ) , and control women ( n = @ ) received either yohimbine or placebo prior to two cocaine cue exposure sessions .
RESULTS	Yohimbine increased ratings of anxiety both before ( p < @ ) and after ( p = @ ) cues , and the post-cue increase in anxiety was more pronounced in women ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Yohimbine also significantly increased craving , compared with placebo ( p < @ ) , following the cue presentation , and this effect was greater in women than men ( gender by treatment interaction ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Yohimbine also increased salivary cortisol ( p < @ ) and dehydroepiandrosterone ( p = @ ) levels , regardless of diagnostic group .
RESULTS	Women had a significantly greater heart rate response following yohimbine as compared with men ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Stress may increase the salience of cocaine cues for cocaine-dependent women as compared with men .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests gender differences in vulnerability to craving and relapse under stressful conditions .

OBJECTIVE	The effects of nutritional management among other intervention components have not been examined for hip-fractured elderly persons with poor nutritional status .
OBJECTIVE	Accordingly , this study explored the intervention effects of an in-home program using a comprehensive care model that included a nutrition-management component on recovery of hip-fractured older persons with poor nutritional status at hospital discharge .
METHODS	A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial with @-month follow-up .
METHODS	A @-bed medical center in northern Taiwan .
METHODS	Subjects were included only if they had `` poor nutritional status '' at hospital discharge , including those at risk for malnutrition or malnourished .
METHODS	The subsample included @ subjects with poor nutritional status in the comprehensive care group , @ in the interdisciplinary care group , and @ in the usual care group .
METHODS	The @ care models were usual care , interdisciplinary care , and comprehensive care .
METHODS	Usual care provided no in-home care , interdisciplinary care provided @ months of in-home rehabilitation , and comprehensive care included management of depressive symptoms , falls , and nutrition as well as @ year of in-home rehabilitation .
METHODS	Data were collected on nutritional status and physical functions , including range of motion , muscle power , proprioception , balance and functional independence , and analyzed using a generalized estimating equation approach .
METHODS	We also compared patients ' baseline characteristics : demographic characteristics , type of surgery , comorbidities , length of hospital stay , cognitive function , and depression .
RESULTS	Patients with poor nutritional status who received comprehensive care were @ times ( @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) more likely to recover their nutritional status than those who received interdisciplinary and usual care .
RESULTS	Furthermore , the comprehensive care model improved the functional independence and balance of patients who recovered their nutritional status over the first year following discharge , but not of those who had not yet recovered .
CONCLUSIONS	An in-home program using the comprehensive care model with a nutritional component effectively improved the nutritional status of hip-fractured patients with poor nutrition .
CONCLUSIONS	This comprehensive care intervention more effectively improved recovery of functional independence and balance for patients with recovered nutritional status .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of vaginal progesterone as luteal support on pregnancy outcomes in infertile patients who undergo ovulation induction with gonadotropins and intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) .
METHODS	Prospective randomized trial .
METHODS	Tertiary referral center .
METHODS	About @ patients with primary infertility were treated during @ ovarian stimulation and IUI cycles from February @ to September @ .
METHODS	All patients underwent ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins combined with IUI .
METHODS	Patients in the supported group received vaginal micronized progesterone capsules @mg once daily from the day after insemination until next menstruation or continuing for up to @ weeks of pregnancy .
METHODS	Women allocated in the control group did not receive luteal phase support .
METHODS	Livebirth rate , clinical pregnancy rate and early miscarriage rate per cycle .
RESULTS	Of the @ cycles , a total of @ clinical pregnancies occurred .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between supported with progesterone and unsupported cycle in terms of livebirth rate ( @ % versus @ % , respectively , with a p value = @ ) and clinical pregnancy rate ( @ % compared with @ % in unsupported cycle with a p value = @ ) .
RESULTS	An early miscarriage rate of @ % was observed in the supported cycles and @ % in the unsupported cycles , with no significant differences between the groups ( p value = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In infertile patients treated with mildly ovarian stimulation with recombinant gonadotropins and IUI , luteal phase support with vaginal progesterone is not associated with higher livebirth rate or clinical pregnancy rate compared with patients who did not receive any luteal phase support .

BACKGROUND	Post-burn hyperglycemia leads to graft failure , multiple organ failure , and death .
BACKGROUND	A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is used to keep serum glucose between @ and @ mg/dL .
BACKGROUND	Because of frequent hypoglycemic episodes , a less-stringent sliding scale insulin protocol is used to maintain serum glucose levels between @ and @ mg/dL after elevations > @ mg/dL .
METHODS	We randomized pediatric patients with massive burns into @ groups , patients receiving sliding scale insulin to lower blood glucose levels ( n = @ ) and those receiving no insulin ( n = @ ) , to determine the differences in morbidity and mortality .
METHODS	Patients @ to @ years old with burns covering @ % of the total body surface area and not randomized to receive anabolic agents were included in this study .
METHODS	End points included glucose levels , infections , resting energy expenditure , lean body mass , bone mineral content , fat mass , muscle strength , and serum inflammatory cytokines , hormones , and liver enzymes .
RESULTS	Maximal glucose levels occurred within @ days of burn injury .
RESULTS	Blood glucose levels were age dependent , with older children requiring more insulin ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Daily maximum and daily minimum , but not @ am , glucose levels were significantly different based on treatment group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Insulin significantly increased resting energy expenditure and improved bone mineral content ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Each additional wound infection increased incidence of hyperglycemia ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no mortality in patients not receiving insulin , only in patients who received insulin ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Muscle strength was increased in patients receiving insulin ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Burn-induced hyperglycemia develops in a subset of severely burned children .
CONCLUSIONS	Length of stay was reduced in the no insulin group , and there were no deaths in this group .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of insulin positively impacted bone mineral content and muscle strength , but increased resting energy expenditure , hypoglycemic episodes , and mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	New glucose-lowering strategies might be needed .

###25815578
OBJECTIVE	To determine the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline hyclate administered orally in the form of experimental formulations with different proportions of acrylic acid-polymethacrylate-based matrices .
METHODS	@ healthy adult dogs .
METHODS	In a crossover study , dogs were randomly assigned ( in groups of @ ) to receive a single oral dose ( @ mg/kg ) of doxycycline hyclate without excipients ( control ) or extended-release formulations ( ERFs ) containing doxycycline , acrylic acid polymer , and polymethacrylate in the following proportions : @:@:@ ( ERF@ ) or @:@:@ ( ERF@ ) .
METHODS	Serum concentrations of doxycycline were determined for pharmacokinetic analysis before and at several intervals after each treatment .
RESULTS	Following oral administration to the study dogs , each ERF resulted in therapeutic serum doxycycline concentrations for @ hours , whereas the control treatment resulted in therapeutic serum doxycycline concentrations for only @ hours .
RESULTS	All pharmacokinetic parameters for ERF@ and ERF@ were significantly different ; however , findings for ERF@ did not differ significantly from those for the control treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Results indicated that both ERFs containing doxycycline , acrylic acid polymer , and polymethacrylate had an adequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship for a time-dependent drug and a longer release time than doxycycline alone following oral administration in dogs .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the minimum effective serum doxycycline concentration of @ g/mL , a dose interval of @ hours can be achieved for each tested ERF .
CONCLUSIONS	This minimum inhibitory concentration has the potential to be effective against several susceptible bacteria involved in important infections in dogs .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment of dogs with either ERF may have several benefits over treatment with doxycycline alone .

BACKGROUND	This study compared mid-term functional and radiologic results of syndesmotic transfixation with no fixation in supination external rotation ( SER ) ankle fractures with intraoperatively confirmed syndesmosis disruption .
BACKGROUND	Our hypothesis was that early-stage good functional results would remain and unfixed syndesmosis disruption in SER IV ankle fractures would not lead to an increased incidence of osteoarthritis .
METHODS	A prospective study of @ operatively treated patients with Lauge-Hansen SER IV ( Weber B ) ankle fractures was performed .
METHODS	After bony fixation , the @-Nm standardized external rotation stress test for both ankles was performed under fluoroscopy .
METHODS	A positive stress examination was defined as a difference of more than @ mm side-to-side in the tibiotalar or tibiofibular clear spaces on mortise radiographs .
METHODS	The patients were randomized to either syndesmotic screw fixation ( @ patients ) or no syndesmotic fixation ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	After a minimum of @ years of follow-up ( mean , @ months ) , ankle function and pain ( Olerud-Molander , a @-mm visual analogue scale -LSB- VAS -RSB- for ankle function and pain ) and quality of life ( RAND-@ ) of all @ patients were assessed .
METHODS	Ankle joint congruity and osteoarthritis were assessed using mortise and lateral projection plain weight-bearing radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ; @T ) scans .
RESULTS	Improvement in Olerud-Molander score , VAS , and RAND-@ showed no significant difference between groups during the follow-up .
RESULTS	In the syndesmotic transfixation group , improvements in all functional parameters and pain measurements were not significant , whereas in the group without syndesmotic fixation , the Olerud-Molander score improved from @ to @ ( P = @ ) and the pain ( VAS ) score improved from @ to @ ( P = @ ) from @ year to last follow-up .
RESULTS	X-ray or MRI imaging showed no difference between groups at the last follow-up visit .
CONCLUSIONS	With the numbers available , no significant difference in functional outcome or radiologic findings could be detected between syndesmosis transfixation and no-fixation patients with SER IV ankle fracture after a minimum of @ years of follow-up .
METHODS	Level II , prospective comparative study .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the impacts on post-stroke spastic hemiplegia treated with temporal three-needle therapy , spastic three-needle therapy , and rehabilitative therapy as well as combined application .
METHODS	One hundred cases were randomized into a Jin 's three-needle group ( @ cases ) , a rehabilitation group ( @ cases ) and a combined therapy group ( @ cases ) .
METHODS	Beside the basic treatment , the acupuncture therapy of temporal three-needle and spastic three-needle techniques , rehabilitation training , and the combined therapy of acupuncture and rehabilitation were applied in the Jin 's three-needle group , the rehabilitation group and the combined therapy group , respectively .
METHODS	Before treatment , in @ days and @ days of treatment , the functional comprehensive assessment scale ( FCA ) , clinical neurological defect score ( NDS ) , four-limb simplified Fugl-Meyer assessment ( FMA ) and clinical spasm index ( CSI ) were adopted to assess the spastic degree and limb function , respectively .
RESULTS	In terms of FCA , NDS and FMA , in @ days of treatment , except the rehabilitation group , the results in the other two groups were all improved as compared with those before treatment ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The results in the Jin 's three-needle group and the combined therapy group were better than those in the rehabilitation group ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In @ days of treatment , the results in the three groups were improved as compared with those before treatment and in @ days of treatment ( P < @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The results in the combined therapy group were better than those in the other two groups ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Regarding CSI assessment , in @ days of treatment , the results of the three groups were all improved significantly as compared with those before treatment ( P < @ , P < @ ) , and the results in the combined therapy group were better than those in the other two groups ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In @ days of treatment , CSI scores were further improved in the three groups , but the difference was not significant in comparison ( all P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The Jin 's three-needle therapy , rehabilitation therapy and the combined application all relieve the symptoms of post-stroke spastic hemiplegia .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect in the Jin 's three-needle group and the combined therapy group is achieved in @ days of treatment , which is better than that in the rehabilitation group .
CONCLUSIONS	The combined therapy a chieves the best effect on spasm in comparison with the single therapy .

BACKGROUND	The ` Older People 's Exercise intervention in Residential and nursing Accommodation ' ( OPERA ) cluster randomised trial evaluated the impact of training for care home staff together with twice-weekly , physiotherapist-led exercise classes on depressive symptoms in care home residents , but found no effect .
BACKGROUND	We report a process evaluation exploring potential explanations for the lack of effect .
METHODS	The OPERA trial included over @,@ residents in @ care homes in the UK .
METHODS	We used a mixed methods approach including quantitative data collected from all homes .
METHODS	In eight case study homes , we carried out repeated periods of observation and interviews with residents , care staff and managers .
METHODS	At the end of the intervention , we held focus groups with OPERA research staff .
METHODS	We reported our first findings before the trial outcome was known .
RESULTS	Homes showed large variations in activity at baseline and throughout the trial .
RESULTS	Overall attendance rate at the group exercise sessions was low ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	We considered two issues that might explain the negative outcome : whether the intervention changed the culture of the homes , and whether the residents engaged with the intervention .
RESULTS	We found low levels of staff training , few home champions for the intervention and a culture that prioritised protecting residents from harm over encouraging activity .
RESULTS	The trial team delivered @,@ exercise groups but only @ % of participants attended at least @ group per week and depressed residents attended significantly fewer groups than those who were not depressed .
RESULTS	Residents were very frail and therefore most groups only included seated exercises .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention did not change the culture of the homes and , in the case study homes , activity levels did not change outside the exercise groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Residents did not engage in the exercise groups at a sufficient level , and this was particularly true for those with depressive symptoms at baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	The physical and mental frailty of care home residents may make it impossible to deliver a sufficiently intense exercise intervention to impact on depressive symptoms .

OBJECTIVE	To compare epirubicin , cisplatin , and capecitabine ( ECX ) with fluorouracil , leucovorin , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) as first-line treatments in patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric junction ( EGJ ) adenocarcinoma .
METHODS	This open , randomized , phase III study was carried out in @ centers .
METHODS	Patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or EGJ cancer were randomly assigned to receive either ECX as first-line treatment ( ECX arm ) or FOLFIRI ( FOLFIRI arm ) .
METHODS	Second-line treatment was predefined ( FOLFIRI for the ECX arm and ECX for the FOLFIRI arm ) .
METHODS	The primary criterion was time-to-treatment failure ( TTF ) of the first-line therapy .
METHODS	Secondary criteria were progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , toxicity , and quality of life .
RESULTS	In all , @ patients were included ( median age , @ years ; @ % male ) .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months , median TTF was significantly longer with FOLFIRI than with ECX ( @ v @ months ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two groups in median PFS ( @ v @ months ; P = @ ) , median OS ( @ v @ months ; P = @ ) , or response rate ( @ % v @ % ) .
RESULTS	First-line FOLFIRI was better tolerated ( overall rate of grade @ to @ toxicity , @ % v @ % ; P < @ ; hematologic adverse events -LSB- AEs -RSB- , @ % v @ % ; P < @ ; nonhematologic AEs : @ % v @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for advanced gastric and EGJ cancer demonstrated significantly better TTF than did ECX .
CONCLUSIONS	Other outcome results indicate that FOLFIRI is an acceptable first-line regimen in this setting and should be explored as a backbone regimen for targeted agents .

OBJECTIVE	The current study is the first to examine whether reactivation of fear memory prior to exposure therapy reduces relapse in a randomized clinical sample .
METHODS	In a standardized treatment protocol combining virtual reality and in-vivo exposure , patients underwent a fear reactivation procedure using a virtual spider @ min prior to a virtual reality ( VR ) exposure ( reactivation group : RG , n = @ ) .
METHODS	A control group ( CG , n = @ ) was exposed to a virtual plant @ min prior to the VR exposure .
METHODS	Outcome measures were a VR spontaneous recovery test ( SRT ) and in-vivo a behavioral avoidance test assessed @ h after VR exposure .
METHODS	One week later an in-vivo exposure session followed .
METHODS	Additionally , a follow-up using psychometric assessment was conducted six months after the first session .
RESULTS	Both groups benefitted significantly and equally from the combined treatment , and importantly , the SRT revealed no return of fear in both groups .
RESULTS	Furthermore , follow-up tests showed long-term treatment effects with no group differences .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to different study components ( VR treatment and in-vivo ) , we were not able to determine which treatment module was mainly responsible for the long-term treatment effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , no direct measure of memory destabilization was possible in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	Our treatment package was highly effective in reducing phobic fear up to @ months following treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Explicit fear reactivation prior to exposure was not beneficial in VR exposure treatment , possibly due to a failure to induce a memory destabilization or due to an implicit fear reactivation prior to treatment in both groups .

BACKGROUND	Antibiotic prescribing in dentistry accounts for @ % of total antibiotic prescriptions in Scottish primary care .
BACKGROUND	The Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme ( SDCEP ) published guidance in April @ ( @nd edition , August @ ) for Drug Prescribing in Dentistry , which aims to assist dentists to make evidence-based antibiotic prescribing decisions .
BACKGROUND	However , wide variation in prescribing persists and the overall use of antibiotics is increasing .
METHODS	RAPiD is a @-month partial factorial cluster randomised trial conducted in NHS General Dental Practices across Scotland .
METHODS	Its aim is to compare the effectiveness of individualised audit and feedback ( A&F ) strategies for the translation into practice of SDCEP recommendations on antibiotic prescribing .
METHODS	The trial uses routinely collected electronic healthcare data in five aspects of its design in order to : identify the study population ; apply eligibility criteria ; carry out stratified randomisation ; generate the trial intervention ; analyse trial outcomes .
METHODS	Eligibility was determined on contract status and a minimum level of recent NHS treatment provision .
METHODS	All eligible dental practices in Scotland were simultaneously randomised at baseline either to current audit practice or to an intervention group .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by single-handed/multi-handed practices .
METHODS	General dental practitioners ( GDPs ) working at intervention practices will receive individualised graphical representations of their antibiotic prescribing rate from the previous @ months at baseline and an update at six months .
METHODS	GDPs could not be blinded to their practice allocation .
METHODS	Intervention practices were further randomised using a factorial design to receive feedback with or without : a health board comparator ; a supplementary text-based intervention ; additional feedback at nine months .
METHODS	The primary outcome is the total antibiotic prescribing rate per @ courses of treatment over the year following delivery of the baseline intervention .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of tramadol , lidocaine , and a combination of tramadol with lidocaine in pain relief using periprostatic nerve block technique by guidance of transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) before the prostate biopsy ( PBx ) .
METHODS	For the indication of TRUS-PBx , the patients with a prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level > @ ng/mL or abnormal digital examination findings were selected .
METHODS	The patients were randomized through random method .
METHODS	Group @ : patients were administered @ mL of @ % lidocaine ; group @ : patients were administered @ mL of @-mg tramadol ; and group @ : patients were administered @ mL of @ % lidocaine + @-mg tramadol .
METHODS	The procedures were completed in @ minutes , and a visual pain scale was administered to the patients to question the pain severity .
RESULTS	TRUS-guided PBx was performed in @ patients with an age range of @-@ years ( mean age , @ @ years ) and a PSA range of @-@ ng/mL .
RESULTS	The mean PSA level of the groups was @ ( @ ) , @ ( @ ) , and @ ( @ ) ng/mL , respectively .
RESULTS	The postprocedural pain scores by visual pain scale were @ @ , @ @ , and @ @ in lidocaine , tramadol , and lidocaine + tramadol groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Periprostatic nerve block is the current golden standard method owing to pain management and comfort provided , independent of the patient age and the number of core biopsies .
CONCLUSIONS	We suggest that tramadol may also be used in this field to achieve better pain management by improving lidocaine 's effect or as an alternative to lidocaine .

BACKGROUND	While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness , few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of ( @ ) an Internet-based patient provider communication service ( IPPC ) , ( @ ) WebChoice , a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients ( IPPC included ) , and ( @ ) usual care on symptom distress , anxiety , depression , ( primary outcomes ) , and self-efficacy ( secondary outcome ) .
OBJECTIVE	This study reports preliminary findings from @ months ' follow-up data in a @-month trial .
METHODS	We recruited @ patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals .
METHODS	The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated .
METHODS	In addition to the IPPC , WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring , tailored information and self-management support , a diary , and communication with other patients .
METHODS	A total of @ care providers ( @ nurses , @ physicians , and @ social workers ) were trained to answer questions from patients .
METHODS	Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time .
RESULTS	Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group ( n = @ ) , the IPPC group ( n = @ ) , or the usual care group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Response rates to questionnaires were @ % ( @/@ ) at @ months , @ ( @/@ ) at @ months , and @ % ( @/@ ) at @ months .
RESULTS	Attrition was similar in all study groups .
RESULTS	Among those with access to WebChoice , @ % ( @/@ ) logged on more than once and @ % ( @/@ ) sent e-messages to care providers .
RESULTS	In the IPPC group , @ % ( @/@ ) sent e-messages .
RESULTS	Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress ( mean difference @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) , anxiety ( mean difference @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) , and depression ( mean difference @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) compared with the usual care group .
RESULTS	The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group ( mean difference @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) , but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety .
RESULTS	No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions , our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness .
CONCLUSIONS	Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to reduce falls among the oldest-old people , including individuals with cognitive impairment or comorbidities .
METHODS	A randomized , single-blind , parallel-group clinical trial was conducted from January @ to December @ in seven primary health care centers in Baix Llobregat ( Barcelona ) .
METHODS	Of @ referred people who were born in @ , @ were randomized to an intervention group or a control group .
METHODS	The intervention model used an algorithm and was multifaceted for both patients and their primary care providers .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were risk of falling and time until falls .
METHODS	Data analyses were by intention-to-treat .
RESULTS	Sixty-five ( @ % ) subjects in the intervention group and @ ( @ % ) in the control group fell during follow-up .
RESULTS	The difference in the risk of falls was not significant ( relative risk @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Cox regression models with time from randomization to the first fall were not significant .
RESULTS	Cox models for recurrent falls showed that intervention had a negative effect ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) and that functional impairment ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , previous falls ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and cognitive impairment ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) had no effect on the assessment .
CONCLUSIONS	This multifactorial intervention among octogenarians , including individuals with cognitive impairment or comorbidities , did not result in a reduction in falls .
CONCLUSIONS	A history of previous falls , disability , and cognitive impairment had no effect on the program among the community-dwelling subjects in this study .

BACKGROUND	There is a need to identify novel pharmacologic targets to treat alcoholism .
BACKGROUND	Animal and human studies suggest a role for ghrelin in the neurobiology of alcohol dependence and craving .
BACKGROUND	Here , we were the first to test the hypothesis that intravenous administration of exogenous ghrelin acutely increases alcohol craving .
METHODS	This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled human laboratory proof-of-concept study .
METHODS	Nontreatment-seeking , alcohol-dependent , heavy-drinking individuals were randomized to receive intravenous ghrelin @ mcg/kg , @ mcg/kg or @ mcg/kg ( placebo ) , followed by a cue-reactivity procedure , during which participants were exposed to neutral ( juice ) and alcohol cues .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was the increase in alcohol craving ( also called urge ) for alcohol , assessed by the Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale .
RESULTS	Out of @ screenings , @ individuals received the study drug .
RESULTS	Repeated measures of analysis of covariance revealed a group effect across ghrelin doses in increasing alcohol craving ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A dose-specific examination revealed a significant effect of ghrelin @ mcg/kg versus placebo in increasing alcohol craving ( p < @ ) with a large effect size ( d = @ ) .
RESULTS	By contrast , no significant ghrelin effect was found in increasing either urge to drink juice or food craving ( p = ns ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences in side effects were found ( p = ns ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous administration of exogenous ghrelin increased alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent heavy-drinking individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the small sample requires confirmatory studies , these findings provide preliminary evidence that ghrelin may play a role in the neurobiology of alcohol craving , thus demonstrating a novel pharmacologic target for treatment .

BACKGROUND	Various treatments are available for reducible unstable fractures of the distal radius , such as closed reduction combined with fixation by external fixator ( EF ) , and rigid internal fixation using a locked volar plate ( VP ) .
BACKGROUND	Although there are studies comparing these methods , there is no conclusive evidence indicating which treatment is best .
BACKGROUND	The hypothesis of this study is that surgical treatment with a VP is more effective than EF from the standpoint of functional outcome ( patient-reported ) .
METHODS	The study is randomized clinical trial with parallel groups and a blinded evaluator and involves the surgical interventions EF and VP .
METHODS	Patients will be randomly assigned ( assignment ratio @:@ ) using sealed opaque envelopes .
METHODS	This trial will include consecutive adult patients with an acute ( up to @ days ) displaced , unstable fracture of the distal end of the radius of type A@ , A@ , C@ , C@ or C@ by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fr Osteosynthesefragen-Association for the Study of Internal Fixation classification and type II or type III by the IDEAL@ classification , without previous surgical treatments of the wrist .
METHODS	The surgical intervention assigned will be performed by three surgical specialists familiar with the techniques described .
METHODS	Evaluations will be performed at @ , and @ weeks , @ , @ and @ months , with the primary outcomes being measured by the Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire and measurement of pain ( Visual Analog Pain Scale and digital algometer ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will include radiographic parameters , objective functional evaluation ( goniometry and dynamometry ) , and the rate of complications and method failure according to the intention-to-treat principle .
METHODS	Final postoperative evaluations ( @ and @ months ) will be performed by independent blinded evaluators .
METHODS	For the Student 's t-test , a difference of @ points in the DASH score , with a @ % confidence interval , a statistical power of @ % , and @ % sampling error results in @ patients per group .

BACKGROUND	Excess sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure , a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
BACKGROUND	It is unknown whether decreasing sodium intake to < @ mg/d has an effect on CVD or all-cause mortality .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to assess whether reductions in sodium intake to < @ mg/d were associated with either an increased or a decreased risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD and all-cause mortality .
METHODS	This observational prospective study of the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterrnea ( PREDIMED ) trial included @ participants at high CVD risk .
METHODS	Sodium intake was evaluated with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized as low ( < @ mg/d ) , intermediate ( @ to @ mg/d ) , high ( > @ to @ mg/d ) , or very high ( > @ mg/d ) .
METHODS	Subsequently , @-y and @-y changes in sodium intake were calculated .
METHODS	Multivariate relative risks were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards ratios .
METHODS	Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to test the effect of changes in sodium intake and the Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet ) .
RESULTS	We documented @ CVD events and @ deaths after a @-y median follow-up .
RESULTS	Sodium intake < @ mg/d was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality : @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) and @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) after @ and @ y , respectively .
RESULTS	Increasing sodium intake after @ y was associated with a @ % ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) higher risk of CVD events .
RESULTS	The incidence rate of CVD was reduced for those who reduced their sodium intake and were randomly assigned to MedDiet interventions -LSB- @ / @,@ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) compared with @ / @,@ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) person-years ; P = @ -RSB- .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreasing sodium intake to < @ mg/d was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality , whereas increasing the intake to > @ mg/d was associated with a higher risk of CVD .
CONCLUSIONS	Our observational data suggest that sodium intake < @ mg/d was associated with an enhanced beneficial effect of the MedDiet on CVD .
CONCLUSIONS	These results should be interpreted with caution , and other confirmatory studies are necessary .

BACKGROUND	In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) , the use of dual antiplatelet therapy is essential to prevent atherothrombotic complications .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , patients are treated with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel , prasugrel , or ticagrelor .
BACKGROUND	Clopidogrel , however , shows a major interindividual variation in antiplatelet effect , which is correlated to an increase in atherothrombotic events in patients with high platelet reactivity .
BACKGROUND	This interindividual variation is partly a result of CYP@C@ genetic variants .
BACKGROUND	Ticagrelor and prasugrel reduce atherothrombotic events but increase bleeding rate and drug costs , as compared with clopidogrel .
BACKGROUND	CYP@C@-based tailoring of antiplatelet therapy might be beneficial to STEMI patients .
METHODS	POPular Genetics ( NCT@ ) is a randomized , open-label , multicenter trial involving @,@ STEMI patients who undergo pPCI .
METHODS	Patients are randomized to CYP@C@ genotyping or routine ticagrelor or prasugrel treatment .
METHODS	In the genotyping group , * @ / * @ ( wild-type ) patients receive clopidogrel , and patients carrying @ or @ * @ or * @ loss-of-function alleles receive ticagrelor or prasugrel .
METHODS	The primary net clinical benefit end point is the composite of death , ( recurrent ) myocardial infarction , definite stent thrombosis , stroke , and Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes ( PLATO ) major bleeding at @ year .
METHODS	Primary safety end point is the composite of ( PLATO ) major and minor bleeding .
METHODS	Cost-effectiveness and quality of life will be assessed by calculating quality-adjusted life-years , net costs per life-year , and per quality-adjusted life-year gained .
CONCLUSIONS	The POPular Genetics study is the first large-scale trial comparing CYP@C@ genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy to a nontailored strategy in terms of net clinical benefit , safety , and cost-effectiveness .

OBJECTIVE	The objectives of this prospective study were to compare the advantages of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SPLC ) versus the classical four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( CLC ) and to discuss these advantages in the light of current literature .
METHODS	Forty eligible patients were randomized to receive SPLC ( Group A , N. = @ ) and CLC ( Group B , N. = @ ) , and investigated with regard to age , sex , BMI ( body mass index ) , ASA ( American Society of Anesthesiologists ) score , type of surgery , operative time , per-operative complication , indication for conversion to open surgery , indication for additional trocar placement in SPLC technique , post-operative pain score , additional narcotic analgesic requirement , nausea and vomiting , post-operative complication and length of hospital stay .
METHODS	Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) was used for pain scoring in all cases .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found among patients in Group A and Group B in terms of age , sex , weight/BMI , ASA score , VAS scores , additional analgesic requirement and length of hospital stay ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	On the other hand , mean operative time in Group A was significantly ( P < @ ) greater than that in Group B. Mean operative time in Group A was observed to be reduced after the first @ operations .
RESULTS	Conversion to open surgery was not required in any of the patients ; however , additional trocar placement was required in two patients in Group A due to body habitus and adhesions , and operations were completed laparoscopically .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that SPLC is equally effective as CLC .
CONCLUSIONS	Patient comfort is increased and pain is decreased as the surgeon gets experienced with the technique .

BACKGROUND	The pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) outcome remains dismal despite multiple therapeutic attempts .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the results of treatment of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) using hypofractionated versus conventional radiotherapy .
METHODS	Seventy-one newly diagnosed DIPG children were randomized into hypofractionated ( HF ) ( @Gy/@ fractions in @ weeks ) and conventional ( CF ) arm ( @Gy/@ fractions in @weeks ) .
RESULTS	The median and one-year overall survival ( OS ) was @ months and @ % for the hypofractionated arm , and @ and @ % for the conventional arm respectively .
RESULTS	The @-month OS difference was @ % .
RESULTS	The OS hazard ratio ( HR ) was @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The hypofractionated arm had a median and one-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) of @ months and @ % , compared to @ and @ % for the conventional arm .
RESULTS	The PFS HR was @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The @-month PFS difference was @ % .
RESULTS	These differences exceed the non-inferiority margin .
RESULTS	The immediate and delayed side effects were not different in the @ arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Hypofractionated radiotherapy offers lesser burden on the patients , their families and the treating departments , with nearly comparable results to conventional fractionation , though not fulfilling the non-inferiority assumption .

OBJECTIVE	Pregnancy rates in US contraceptive clinical trials are increasing due to decreased treatment compliance .
OBJECTIVE	This study compared compliance with a new low-dose levonorgestrel ( LNG ) and ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) contraceptive patch ( CP , Twirla ) with that of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive ( COC ) in a demographically diverse population .
METHODS	This analysis was part of an open-label , parallel-group , multicenter phase @ study that randomized healthy sexually active women ( @-@years ) to @cycles of LNG/EE CP or @cycles of COC , then @cycles of LNG/EE CP .
METHODS	We defined self-reported compliance as cycles that , according to diaries , show @days of patch wear without missed days or any patch worn > @days or @days of pill-taking without missed pill days .
METHODS	We verified compliance by detectable plasma presence of LNG and EE at cycles @ , @ , and @ .
RESULTS	Of the intention-to-treat population with diary information ( N = @ , mean age @ years , @ % minorities , @ % obese ) , @ % of the CP ( n = @ ) versus @ % of the COC group ( n = @ ) self-reported noncompliance after @cycles ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Laboratory assessments verified @-@ % of participants in both groups as noncompliant .
RESULTS	Self-reported perfect use did not vary between obese -LSB- body mass index ( BMI ) @kg/m ( @ ) -RSB- versus nonobese ( BMI < @kg/m ( @ ) ) participants in both groups or when stratified by age , education , or race/ethnicity in the CP group .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-reported compliance was significantly greater in the CP than COC group and did not vary by obesity status .
CONCLUSIONS	Discrepancies between self-reported and verified compliance question reliability of patient diaries .
CONCLUSIONS	This paper , based on an analysis of a phase @ trial , shows that compliance was significantly greater with a new weekly transdermal CP than with a once-daily COC in obese as well as nonobese participants .
CONCLUSIONS	Discrepancies between self-reported compliance and laboratory-verified compliance raise questions regarding the reliability of patient diaries .

BACKGROUND	Pediatric respiratory infections caused by antibiotic-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae ( ANSP ) continue to present an important challenge , even after introduction of @-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV@ ) .
BACKGROUND	This randomized double-blind trial assessed the potential additional impact of PCV@ over PCV@ on reducing ANSP carriage .
METHODS	Healthy infants were randomly assigned to receive PCV@ ( n = @ ) or PCV@ ( n = @ ) at ages @ , @ , @ , or @ months .
METHODS	Eight nasopharyngeal specimens were collected by swabbing between ages @ and @ months .
METHODS	S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method and the Etest .
METHODS	Nasopharyngeal acquisition and prevalence of ANSP during ages @-@ months were compared between the @ vaccine groups .
RESULTS	In general , new acquisition of pneumococci nonsusceptible to penicillin , erythromycin , clindamycin , penicillin plus erythromycin , and multiple drugs ( @ antibiotics ) was significantly lower in the PCV@ group compared with the PCV@ group ; the main serotypes contributing to this significant decrease were serotype @F , present in PCV@ and PCV@ , and serotypes @A and @A , present in PCV@ only .
CONCLUSIONS	PCV@ has a significant added benefit over PCV@ in reducing carriage of ANSP .
CONCLUSIONS	Because carriage determines transmission , these results suggest that PCV@ will provide protection against ANSP disease that exceeds protection provided by PCV@ .

BACKGROUND	Homeless adults are more likely to smoke tobacco and are less likely to successfully quit smoking than smokers in the general population , despite comparable numbers of cessation attempts and desire to quit .
BACKGROUND	To date , studies that have examined smoking cessation in homeless samples have used traditional lab/clinic-based assessment methodologies .
BACKGROUND	Real-time assessment of key variables may provide new insights into the process of quitting among homeless smokers .
METHODS	The purpose of the current study was to identify predictors of a quit attempt using real-time assessment methodology during the @ days prior to a scheduled quit attempt among homeless adults seeking care at a shelter-based smoking cessation clinic .
METHODS	Parameters for multiple variables ( i.e. , motivation for quitting , smoking expectancies , quit self-efficacy , smoking urges , negative affect , positive affect , restlessness , hostility , and stress ) were calculated and were used as predictors of biochemically verified quit date abstinence ( i.e. , @hr abstinent ) using logistic regression analyses .
RESULTS	Participants ( n = @ ) were predominantly male ( @ % ) , non-White ( @ % ) , and smoked an average of @ cigarettes per day .
RESULTS	A total of @,@ ecological momentary assessments ( @ % completion rate ) were collected at random times ( i.e. , up to @ assessments/day ) during the @ days prior to a scheduled quit attempt .
RESULTS	Results indicated that declining ( negative slope ) negative affect , restlessness , and stress predicted quit date abstinence .
RESULTS	Additionally , increasing positive coping expectancies across the prequit week predicted quit date abstinence .
CONCLUSIONS	Study findings highlight multiple variables that may be targeted during the precessation period to increase smoking cessation attempts in this difficult to treat population of smokers .

BACKGROUND	Breast cancer ( BC ) is the most common cancer among females in Turkey .
BACKGROUND	Predictors affecting the breast self-examination ( BSE ) performance vary in developing countries .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the frequency of BSE performance and predictors of self-reported BSEs among women in the capital city of Turkey .
METHODS	This cross-sectional study was conducted on @ Turkish women using a self - administered questionnaire covering socio-demographic variables and BSE-related features .
RESULTS	Of the participants , @ % ( N = @ ) reported practicing BSE , whereas @ % ( N = @ ) were implementing BSE regularly on a monthly basis , and only @ % ( N = @ ) were performing BSE regularly within a week after each menstrual cycle .
RESULTS	Multivariate logistic regression modeling revealed that BSE performance was more likely in younger age groups -LSB- @-@ years -RSB- ( p = @ , OR = @ ) and -LSB- @-@ years -RSB- ( p = @ , OR = @ ) , women having a family history of breast disease ( p = @ , OR = @ ) , and housewives ( p = @ , OR = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although it appears that the rates of BSE performers are high , the number of women conducting appropriate BSE on a regular time interval basis is lower than expected .
CONCLUSIONS	Younger age groups , family history of breast diseases and not being employed were identified as significant predictors of practicing BSE appropriately .
CONCLUSIONS	Older age and employment were risk factors for not performing BSE in this sample .

CONCLUSIONS	This prospective study showed that the incidence of acute anterior uveitis , confirmed by ophthalmic examination , in patients receiving intravenous zoledronate infusions as part of a randomized controlled trial for fracture prevention is @ % .
BACKGROUND	We prospectively investigated the incidence of ocular side effects after a single intravenous zoledronate infusion .
METHODS	In a secondary analysis of a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which early post-menopausal women ( N = @ ) with normal bone density or osteopenia were randomized to infusion of zoledronate @ mg ( N = @ ) or placebo ( N = @ ) , we analyzed significant adverse ocular events occurring within @ months .
RESULTS	Fourteen participants reported ocular symptoms after the infusion .
RESULTS	All were examined by an ophthalmologist and eight were diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis ( AAU ) and one with sectoral episcleritis .
RESULTS	The incidence of AAU and episcleritis was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , respectively , in the zoledronate group and @ % for both conditions in the placebo group ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean time from infusion to symptom onset for AAU was @ days ( range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Three cases were bilateral .
RESULTS	AAU was mild-moderate in seven participants and severe in one .
RESULTS	All affected eyes were treated with topical cyclopentolate @ % ( to break , or minimize , posterior synechiae ) , and intensive , potent , topical corticosteroids with a tapering regime based on treatment response .
RESULTS	The mean duration of topical corticosteroid was @ days ( range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	The mean , best corrected visual acuity was @/@ ( range @/@-@ / @ ) at presentation , which remained unchanged after AAU resolution .
RESULTS	None of the participants lost vision , and no long-term sequelae were reported at last follow-up ( range @-@ months post-infusion ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Prescribers should inform patients about the possibility of ocular side effects with zoledronate infusions and refer promptly to an ophthalmologist if symptoms develop .

BACKGROUND	Residual proteinuria during renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) blockade is a major renal and cardiovascular risk factor in chronic kidney disease .
BACKGROUND	Dietary sodium restriction potentiates the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS blockade , but residual proteinuria remains in many patients .
BACKGROUND	Previous studies linked high fibroblast growth factor @ ( FGF-@ ) levels with volume overload ; others linked higher serum phosphate levels with impaired RAAS-blockade efficacy .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that FGF-@ reduces the capacity of dietary sodium restriction to potentiate RAAS blockade , impairing the antiproteinuric effect .
METHODS	Post hoc analysis of cohort data from a randomized crossover trial with two @-week study periods comparing proteinuria after a regular-sodium diet with proteinuria after a low-sodium diet , both during background angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition .
METHODS	@ nondiabetic patients with CKD with residual proteinuria ( median protein excretion , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ @ -RSB- g/d ; mean age , @ -LSB- SD -RSB- years ; creatinine clearance , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ -RSB- mL/min ) .
METHODS	Plasma carboxy-terminal FGF-@ levels .
RESULTS	Difference in residual proteinuria at the end of the regular-sodium versus low-sodium study period .
RESULTS	Residual proteinuria during the low-sodium diet period adjusted for proteinuria during the regular-sodium diet period .
RESULTS	Higher baseline FGF-@ level was associated with reduced antiproteinuric response to dietary sodium restriction ( standardized = -@ ; P = @ ; model R ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	For every @-RU/mL increase in FGF-@ level , the antiproteinuric response to dietary sodium restriction was reduced by @ % .
RESULTS	Higher baseline FGF-@ level was a determinant of more residual proteinuria during the low-sodium diet ( standardized = @ ; P = @ ) in linear regression analysis adjusted for baseline proteinuria ( model R ( @ ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no interaction with creatinine clearance ( P interaction = @ ) .
RESULTS	Baseline FGF-@ level did not predict changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure upon intensified antiproteinuric treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Observational study , limited sample size .
CONCLUSIONS	FGF-@ levels are associated independently with impaired antiproteinuric response to sodium restriction in addition to RAAS blockade .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should address whether FGF-@-lowering strategies may further optimize proteinuria reduction by RAAS blockade combined with dietary sodium restriction .

OBJECTIVE	Low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended over warfarin for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) in patients with active cancer largely based on results of a single , large trial .
OBJECTIVE	To study the efficacy and safety of tinzaparin vs warfarin for treatment of acute , symptomatic VTE in patients with active cancer .
METHODS	A randomized , open-label study with blinded central adjudication of study outcomes enrolled patients in @ centers in Asia , Africa , Europe , and North , Central , and South America between August @ and November @ .
METHODS	Adult patients with active cancer ( defined as histologic diagnosis of cancer and receiving anticancer therapy or diagnosed with , or received such therapy , within the previous @ months ) and objectively documented proximal deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) or pulmonary embolism , with a life expectancy greater than @ months and without contraindications for anticoagulation , were followed up for @ days and for @ days after the last study medication dose for collection of safety data .
METHODS	Tinzaparin ( @ IU/kg ) once daily for @ months vs conventional therapy with tinzaparin ( @ IU/kg ) once daily for @ to @ days followed by warfarin at a dose adjusted to maintain the international normalized ratio within the therapeutic range ( @-@ @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	Primary efficacy outcome was a composite of centrally adjudicated recurrent DVT , fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism , and incidental VTE .
METHODS	Safety outcomes included major bleeding , clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding , and overall mortality .
RESULTS	Nine hundred patients were randomized and included in intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses .
RESULTS	Recurrent VTE occurred in @ of @ patients treated with tinzaparin and @ of @ patients treated with warfarin ( @-month cumulative incidence , @ % for tinzaparin vs @ % for warfarin ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in major bleeding ( @ patients for tinzaparin vs @ patients for warfarin ; HR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) or overall mortality ( @ patients for tinzaparin vs @ patients for warfarin ; HR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A significant reduction in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed with tinzaparin ( @ of @ patients for tinzaparin vs @ of @ patients for warfarin ; HR , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with active cancer and acute symptomatic VTE , the use of full-dose tinzaparin ( @ IU/kg ) daily compared with warfarin for @ months did not significantly reduce the composite measure of recurrent VTE and was not associated with reductions in overall mortality or major bleeding , but was associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to assess whether the efficacy outcomes would be different in patients at higher risk of recurrent VTE .

BACKGROUND	The role of body mass index ( BMI ) in survival outcomes is controversial among lymphoma patients .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the association between BMI at study entry and failure-free survival ( FFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in three phase III clinical trials , among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , follicular lymphoma ( FL ) and Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) .
METHODS	A total of @ , @ and @ patients with DLBCL , HL and FL were included in the analysis .
METHODS	Baseline patient and clinical characteristics , treatment received and clinical outcomes were compared across BMI categories .
RESULTS	Among patients with DLBCL , HL and FL , the median age was @ , @ and @ ; @ % , @ % and @ % were obese and @ % , @ % and @ % were overweight , respectively .
RESULTS	Age was significantly different among BMI groups in all three studies .
RESULTS	Higher BMI groups tended to have more favorable prognosis factors at study entry among DLBCL and HL patients .
RESULTS	BMI was not associated with clinical outcome with P-values of @ , @ and @ for FFS , and @ , @ and @ for OS , for patients with DLBCL , HL and FL , respectively .
RESULTS	The association remains non-significant after adjusting for other clinical factors in the Cox model .
RESULTS	A subset analysis of males with DLBCL treated on R-CHOP revealed no differences in FFS ( P = @ ) or OS ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BMI was not significantly associated with clinical outcomes among patients with DLBCL , HD or FL , in three prospective phase III clinical trials .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings contradict some previous reports of similar investigations .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is required to understand the observed discrepancies .

OBJECTIVE	Although transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) is the most common treatment option in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , its clinical benefits remain still controversial .
OBJECTIVE	Since TACE induces hypoxic necrosis in tumors , hypoxia-inducible factor @ ( HIF-@ ) could critically affect biology in residual tumors after TACE treatment and subsequent prognosis .
OBJECTIVE	However , HIF-@ and its prognostic relevance in TACE have rarely been examined in human specimens .
OBJECTIVE	In the current study , we investigated the prognosis and expression of genes regulated by HIF-@ in HCC patients receiving preoperative TACE for the first time .
METHODS	In total , @ patients with HCC ( @ patients undergoing preoperative TACE ) were retrospectively studied .
METHODS	The prognostic significance of TACE was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models .
METHODS	Protein levels of HIF-@ and mRNA levels of HIF-@-associated genes were examined using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and real-time RT-PCR , respectively .
RESULTS	Preoperative TACE was significantly associated with increased @-year recurrence rate ( @ vs. @ % , P = @ ) and shorter disease-free survival ( DFS ) time ( @ vs. @ months , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	TACE was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence ( P = @ ) and poor DFS ( P = @ ) in a multivariate analysis .
RESULTS	Immunohistochemical staining revealed in vivo activation of HIF-@ in human specimens treated with TACE .
RESULTS	Notably , protein levels of HIF-@ were significantly increased in TACE tissues demonstrated by IHC .
RESULTS	Transcriptional targets of HIF-@ showed mRNA expression patterns consistent with activation of HIF-@ in TACE tissues .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings collectively demonstrate that preoperative TACE confers poor prognosis in HCC patients through activation of HIF-@ .

BACKGROUND	There are conflicting reports on the impact of soy on breast carcinogenesis .
BACKGROUND	This study examines the effects of soy supplementation on breast cancer-related genes and pathways .
METHODS	Women ( n = @ ) with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to soy protein supplementation ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) for @ to @ days , from diagnosis until surgery .
METHODS	Adherence was determined by plasma isoflavones : genistein and daidzein .
METHODS	Gene expression changes were evaluated by NanoString in pre - and posttreatment tumor tissue .
METHODS	Genome-wide expression analysis was performed on posttreatment tissue .
METHODS	Proliferation ( Ki@ ) and apoptosis ( Cas@ ) were assessed by immunohistochemistry .
RESULTS	Plasma isoflavones rose in the soy group ( two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test , P < @ ) and did not change in the placebo group .
RESULTS	In paired analysis of pre - and posttreatment samples , @ genes ( out of @ ) showed altered expression ( two-sided Student 's t-test , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Several genes including FANCC and UGT@A@ revealed different magnitude and direction of expression changes between the two groups ( two-sided Student 's t-test , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A high-genistein signature consisting of @ differentially expressed genes was identified from microarray analysis of tumors .
RESULTS	This signature was characterized by overexpression ( > @-fold ) of cell cycle transcripts , including those that promote cell proliferation , such as FGFR@ , E@F@ , BUB@ , CCNB@ , MYBL@ , CDK@ , and CDC@ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Soy intake did not result in statistically significant changes in Ki@ or Cas@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Gene expression associated with soy intake and high plasma genistein defines a signature characterized by overexpression of FGFR@ and genes that drive cell cycle and proliferation pathways .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings raise the concerns that in a subset of women soy could adversely affect gene expression in breast cancer .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of yeast hydrolysate on the abdominal fat in obese humans .
METHODS	We observed the effects of yeast hydrolysate that had a molecular weight below @ kDa on the anti-abdominal fat accumulation in obese men and women ages @ to @ y for @ wk .
METHODS	The abdominal fat mass was assessed by computed tomographic scans .
RESULTS	By the sixth week , the reductions in energy intake in the yeast group ( yeast hydrolysate @ g/d ) were significantly greater than those in the control group ( placebo @ g/d ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The body weight and body mass index ( BMI ) were significantly reduced by week @ compared with baseline in the yeast group , and these differences were significantly greater than those in the control group : body weight @ kg versus -@ k g ( P < @ ) , BMI @ kg/m ( @ ) versus -@ kg/m ( @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Despite the increased loss of body weight in the yeast group , lean body mass did not significantly differ between the two groups .
RESULTS	Body fat mass in the control group did not significantly change between baseline and week @ .
RESULTS	However , the yeast group lost a significant amount of body fat mass after @ wk of treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The differences in abdominal fat thickness and abdominal circumference between the two groups were significant after @ wk of treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The total abdominal fat area in the yeast group was significantly lower than in the control group after @ wk of treatment ( -@ cm ( @ ) versus -@ cm ( @ ) ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Yeast hydrolysate can reduce body weight and the accumulation of abdominal fat without an adverse effect on lean body mass in obese adults , regardless of sex , via the reduction of energy intake .

BACKGROUND	Intranasal ( IN ) insulin acutely improves verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) / Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , but its therapeutic effects may be attenuated in apolipoprotein E@ ( ApoE@ ) carriers .
BACKGROUND	Furthermore , rapid-acting ( RA ) insulins may have superior therapeutic effects compared with regular insulin types .
OBJECTIVE	To measure the safety and efficacy of intranasally delivered RA glulisine in ApoE@ carriers with mild-moderate AD .
METHODS	We performed a double-blinded , randomized , cross-over study of RA insulin glulisine in nine mild-moderate AD subjects to better understand the relationship between RA insulin , ApoE@ carrier status and memory performance .
RESULTS	IN glulisine was well tolerated but failed to have an acute impact on cognition in ApoE@ carriers with AD .
RESULTS	Serum insulin levels acutely dropped following treatment , but peripheral glucose levels remained unchanged .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger clinical trials of longer duration are necessary to better understand the relationships between RA insulin , ApoE@ carrier status and cognitive performance in AD .

BACKGROUND	Health-promoting lifestyle choices of adolescents are closely related to current and subsequent health status .
BACKGROUND	However , parsimonious yet reliable and valid screening tools are scarce .
BACKGROUND	The original @-item adolescent health promotion ( AHP ) scale was developed by our research team and has been applied to measure adolescent health-promoting behaviors worldwide .
BACKGROUND	The aim of our study was to examine the psychometric properties of a newly developed short-form version of the AHP ( AHP-SF ) including tests of its reliability and validity .
METHODS	The study was conducted in nine middle and high schools in southern Taiwan .
METHODS	Participants were @ adolescents randomly divided into two subgroups with equal size and homogeneity of baseline characteristics .
METHODS	The first subsample ( calibration sample ) was used to modify and shorten the factorial model while the second subsample ( validation sample ) was utilized to validate the result obtained from the first one .
METHODS	The psychometric testing of the AHP-SF included internal reliability of McDonald 's omega and Cronbach 's alpha , convergent validity , discriminant validity , and construct validity with confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) .
RESULTS	The results of the CFA supported a six-factor model and @ items were retained in the AHP-SF with acceptable model fit .
RESULTS	For the discriminant validity test , results indicated that adolescents with lower AHP-SF scores were more likely to be overweight or obese , skip breakfast , and spend more time watching TV and playing computer games .
RESULTS	The AHP-SF also showed excellent internal consistency with a McDonald 's omega of @ ( Cronbach 's alpha @ ) in the calibration group .
CONCLUSIONS	The current findings suggest that the AHP-SF is a valid and reliable instrument for the evaluation of adolescent health-promoting behaviors .
CONCLUSIONS	Primary health care providers and clinicians can use the AHP-SF to assess these behaviors and evaluate the outcome of health promotion programs in the adolescent population .

BACKGROUND	The development of secondary non-response ( SNR ) to botulinum neurotoxin type-A ( BoNT-A ) is considered a key issue in the management of cervical dystonia ( CD ) .
BACKGROUND	This case-controlled study was performed to systematically identify factors influencing SNR during BoNT-A therapy .
METHODS	This was a retrospective , international , non-interventional study of CD patients .
METHODS	Patients with SNR were matched with up to three responder patients ( control ) on the basis of duration of therapy and number of injection cycles .
METHODS	Factors influencing the development of SNR were screened using a univariate logistic regression model and confirmed using a multivariate conditional logistic regression model .
RESULTS	@ patients were enrolled , and @ ( SNR = @ ; responder = @ ) were matched and subdivided into blocks ( doublets , triplets or quadruplets ) .
RESULTS	At baseline , a significantly higher proportion of SNR patients had received previous or concomitant therapies ( p = @ ) and surgery for CD ( p = @ ) compared with controls .
RESULTS	Although disease severity at onset was similar between groups , a significantly higher proportion of SNR patients experienced severe CD at the time of SNR compared with controls at the last documented visit .
RESULTS	Multivariate analyses identified five factors that were significantly associated in predicting SNR ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- > @ indicated higher chances for being SNR ) : previous surgical procedure for CD ( OR @ , p = @ ) , previous BoNT-A related severe adverse event ( AE ) ( OR @ p = @ ) , physical therapy ( OR @ , p = @ ) , neuroleptic use ( OR @ , p = @ ) and average BoNT-A dose ( OR @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that SNR may not reflect true pharmacological resistance to BoNT-A therapy , but may be related to underlying disease severity .

BACKGROUND	Acupuncture has been widely used as a treatment for stroke in China for more than @,@ years .
BACKGROUND	However , previous research has not yet shown that acupuncture is effective as a stroke treatment .
BACKGROUND	We report a protocol for a multicenter , randomized , controlled , and outcome assessor-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on acute ischemic stroke .
METHODS	In a prospective trial involving three hospitals in the Zhejiang Province ( China ) @ patients with a recent ( less than @ week previous ) episode of ischemic stroke will be included .
METHODS	Patients will be randomized into two groups : an acupuncture group given scalp acupuncture and electroacupuncture , and a control group given no acupuncture .
METHODS	Eighteen treatment sessions will be performed over a three-week period .
METHODS	The primary outcome will be measured by changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at the one , three , and four-week follow-up .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures will be : @ ) the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale for motor function ; @ ) the mini-mental state examination and Montreal cognitive assessment for cognitive function ; @ ) the video-fluoroscopic swallowing study for swallowing ability ; and @ ) the incidence of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial is expected to clarify whether or not acupuncture is effective for acute stroke .
CONCLUSIONS	It will also show if acupuncture can improve motor , cognitive , or swallowing function .

OBJECTIVE	The extant literature on predictors of treatment response to behavioral treatments for insomnia is equivocal and limited in scope .
OBJECTIVE	The current study examined demographic , clinical , and sleep characteristics as predictors of clinically significant treatment response to brief behavioral treatment of insomnia ( BBTI ) in older adults with insomnia .
METHODS	Thirty-nine older adults with insomnia ( @ % females , mean age : @ years ) were randomized to BBTI treatment .
METHODS	Treatment outcomes were defined according to @ criteria : ( @ ) `` response , '' defined as change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) score @ points or increase in sleep diary sleep efficiency @ % ) ; or ( @ ) remission , defined as absence of a clinical diagnosis of insomnia according to standard diagnostic criteria .
METHODS	Logistic regression examined whether baseline demographic , clinical , or sleep characteristics predicted treatment outcomes at @ month follow-up .
RESULTS	Demographic variables did not predict treatment outcomes for either criterion .
RESULTS	Higher anxiety , depression , poorer sleep quality , and longer polysomnography ( PSG ) - assessed sleep latency predicted greater likelihood of response at follow-up ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Longer sleep duration at baseline ( measured by sleep diary and PSG ) predicted greater likelihood of the remission at follow-up ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with insomnia who have greater distress at baseline or prolonged sleep latency are more likely to show positive response to BBTI .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , short sleepers at baseline are less likely to have resolution of insomnia diagnosis following BBTI , perhaps due to the sleep restriction component of the treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the cardiorespiratory effects of IV administration of propofol ( @ mg/kg ) , ketamine hydrochloride and propofol ( @ mg/kg each ; K-P ) , or ketamine hydrochloride ( @ mg/kg ) and diazepam ( @ mg/kg ; K-D ) before and after induction of anesthesia ( IoA ) in dogs sedated with acepromazine maleate and oxymorphone hydrochloride .
METHODS	@ healthy adult Beagles .
METHODS	Each dog was randomly allocated to receive @ of @ treatments ( @-week interval ) .
METHODS	For instrumentation prior to each treatment , each dog was anesthetized with isoflurane .
METHODS	After full recovery , acepromazine ( @ mg/kg ) and oxymorphone ( @ mg/kg ) were administered IV .
METHODS	Fifteen minutes later ( before IoA ) , each dog received treatment IV with propofol , K-P , or K-D .
METHODS	Cardiorespiratory and arterial blood gas variables were assessed before , immediately after , and @ minutes after IoA .
RESULTS	Compared with findings before IoA , dogs receiving the K-P or K-D treatment had increased cardiac output , oxygen delivery , and heart rate @ minutes after IoA ; K-P administration did not change mean arterial blood pressure or stroke volume and decreased systemic vascular resistance .
RESULTS	Propofol decreased mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance immediately after IoA but did not change heart rate , cardiac output , or oxygen delivery .
RESULTS	All treatments caused some degree of apnea , hypoventilation , and hypoxemia ( Pao@ < @ mm Hg ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In dogs , K-P treatment maintained mean arterial blood pressure better than propofol alone and increased heart rate , cardiac output , or oxygen delivery , as did the K-D treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Supplemental @ % oxygen should be provided during IoA with all @ treatments .

OBJECTIVE	Antibiotic resistance is the main reason for failure of Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) treatment .
OBJECTIVE	Currently , guidelines recommend a treatment guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing after two failures .
OBJECTIVE	However , microbial culture is not feasible everywhere , and the limited number of effective antibiotics against the bacterium narrows the options ; thus a rescue therapy combining antibiotics with a low resistance may be fitting .
METHODS	Patients who have failed a first-line treatment ( either prolonged triple or sequential regimens ) and , successively , a levofloxacin-based triple therapy were considered for the study .
METHODS	Subjects underwent urea breath test ( UBT ) , stool antigen test ( ST ) and endoscopy/histology to confirm the diagnosis .
METHODS	Cytopenia and impaired liver and kidney function were exclusion criteria .
METHODS	Fifty-four subjects were randomized @:@ to two regimens : RMB Rabeprazole/Rifabutin/Minocycline / Bismuth sub-citrate or MTB Rabeprazole/Tinidazole/Minocycline / Bismuth sub-citrate both for @ days .
METHODS	The results were checked @ weeks after the end of therapy with ST/UBT plus endoscopy when indicated .
RESULTS	RMB eradicated the bacterium in @ patients .
RESULTS	Two subjects dropped out .
RESULTS	The eradication rate was @ % ( CI @-@ @ % ) at intention-to-treat and @ % ( CI @-@ @ % ) at per-protocol analysis .
RESULTS	MTB was successful in @ patients ( @ % , CI @-@ @ % ) .
RESULTS	No patient withdrew from the treatment for adverse events .
RESULTS	Drug-related side effects were reported only in @ subjects , but in all cases the treatment was carried on .
CONCLUSIONS	The association minocycline/rifabutin seems to have a synergic effect and a good therapeutic outcome in patients who have failed at least two previous regimens , although a trial on a large population is needed .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of automated adjustment of the inspired oxygen fraction ( FiO@ ) on arterial oxygen saturation ( SpO@ ) and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation ( SctO@ ) in very low birth weight infants with frequent fluctuations in oxygenation .
METHODS	Fifteen infants ( median gestational age , @ weeks -LSB- range , @-@ weeks -RSB- ; median age , @ days -LSB- range , @-@ days -RSB- ) were assigned in random sequence to @ hours of automated adjustment of FiO@ or manual adjustment of FiO@ .
METHODS	Primary outcome measurements were time within the SpO@ target range and the area under the curve above and below a defined SctO@ range .
RESULTS	Percentage of time within the SpO@ target range increased during automated FiO@ control ( @ % @ % vs @ % @ % for manual ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Prolonged episodes with SpO@ < @ % of > @ seconds duration ( median , @ episodes -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- vs @ episodes -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- ; P < @ ) and of > @ seconds duration ( median , @ episodes -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- vs @ episodes -LSB- range , @-@ -RSB- ; P < @ ) decreased significantly during the automated period .
RESULTS	Percentage of time with SpO@ > @ % decreased during automated control ( @ % @ % vs @ % @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in FiO@ exposure .
RESULTS	The area ( deviation time ) below and above the defined SctO@ threshold did not differ between the @ periods ( median , @ % * seconds -LSB- range , @ % -@ % -RSB- for manual vs @ % * seconds -LSB- range , @ % -@ % -RSB- for automated ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Automated FiO@ control in preterm infants with frequent SpO@ fluctuations significantly increased the time within the SpO@ target range and reduced the incidence of prolonged hypoxemic events compared with manual FiO@ adjustment , but did not significantly affect cerebral tissue oxygenation .

BACKGROUND	In patients with severe sepsis , no randomized clinical trial has tested the concept of de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to compare the de-escalation strategy with the continuation of an appropriate empirical treatment in those patients .
METHODS	This was a multicenter non-blinded randomized noninferiority trial of patients with severe sepsis who were randomly assigned to de-escalation or continuation of empirical antimicrobial treatment .
METHODS	Recruitment began in February @ and ended in April @ in nine intensive care units ( ICUs ) in France .
METHODS	Patients with severe sepsis were assigned to de-escalation ( n = @ ) or continuation of empirical antimicrobial treatment ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was to measure the duration of ICU stay .
METHODS	We defined a noninferiority margin of @ days .
METHODS	If the lower boundary of the @ % confidence interval ( CI ) for the difference in patients assigned to the de-escalation group was less than @ days , as compared with that of patients assigned to the continuation group , de-escalation was considered to be noninferior to the continuation strategy .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included mortality at @ days , occurrence of organ failure , number of superinfections , and number of days with antibiotics during the ICU stay .
RESULTS	The median duration of ICU stay was @ -LSB- interquartile range ( IQR ) @-@ -RSB- days in the de-escalation group and @ -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- days in the continuation group , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean difference was @ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
RESULTS	A superinfection occurred in @ ( @ % ) patients in the de-escalation group and six ( @ % ) patients in the continuation group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The numbers of antibiotic days were @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- in the de-escalation group and continuation group , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mortality was similar in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	As compared to the continuation of the empirical antimicrobial treatment , a strategy based on de-escalation of antibiotics resulted in prolonged duration of ICU stay .
CONCLUSIONS	However , it did not affect the mortality rate .

OBJECTIVE	Increased coagulation activation may contribute to the high incidence of cardiovascular complications observed in obese and type @ diabetes ( T@D ) subjects .
OBJECTIVE	Although tissue factor ( TF ) , the primary initiator of coagulation is increased in obesity , its expression in adipose tissues and its association with metabolic parameters are unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to compare TF expression in plasma and adipose tissues of obese subjects with and without T@D , its correlation with metabolic parameters , and regulation in response to antidiabetic drugs .
METHODS	Subjects were recruited from diabetes clinics and adipose tissue was obtained by needle biopsy of lower subcutaneous abdominal depot .
METHODS	For the intervention study , subjects were randomized into treatment groups with rosiglitazone or metformin for @ months .
RESULTS	Plasma TF antigen , activity , and adipose TF mRNA were greater in obese T@D subjects compared with obese nondiabetics .
RESULTS	Plasma TF activity correlated with fasting insulin , glucose , and free fatty acids , ( FFAs ) , and adipose TF mRNA correlated with plasma FFA .
RESULTS	Plasma TF activity was reduced by metformin and increased with rosiglitazone treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Specific diabetes-related metabolic parameters , but not obesity per se , are correlated with TF expression .
CONCLUSIONS	Regulation of TF activity by different classes of antidiabetic drugs may relate to protective or adverse cardiovascular outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Individuals with schizophrenia have functionally significant deficits in automatic and controlled social cognition , but no currently available pharmacologic treatments reduce these deficits .
BACKGROUND	The neuropeptide oxytocin has multiple prosocial effects when administered intranasally in humans and there is growing interest in its therapeutic potential in schizophrenia .
METHODS	We administered @ IU of oxytocin and saline placebo intranasally to @ male subjects with schizophrenia and @ age-matched , healthy controls in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study .
METHODS	Social cognition was assessed with The Awareness of Social Inference Test ( TASIT ) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test ( RMET ) .
METHODS	We examined the effects of oxytocin administration on automatic social cognition ( the ability to rapidly interpret and understand emotional cues from the voice , face , and body ) ; controlled social cognition ( the ability to comprehend indirectly expressed emotions , thoughts , and intentions through complex deliberations over longer time periods ) ; and a control task ( the ability to comprehend truthful dialog and perform general task procedures ) in individuals with and without schizophrenia using mixed factorial analysis of variance models .
RESULTS	Patients with schizophrenia showed significant impairments in automatic and controlled social cognition compared to healthy controls , and administration of oxytocin significantly improved their controlled , but not automatic , social cognition , F ( @ , @ ) = @ ; p = @ .
RESULTS	Conversely , oxytocin administration had limited effects on social cognition in healthy participants .
RESULTS	Patients and controls performed equally well and there were no effects of oxytocin administration on the control task .
CONCLUSIONS	Intact social cognitive abilities are associated with better functional outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data highlight the potentially complex effects of oxytocin on some but not all aspects of social cognition , and support the exploration of intranasal oxytocin as a potential adjunct treatment to improve controlled social cognition in schizophrenia .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate associations between timing of adiposity rebound ( AR ; the period in childhood where BMI begins to increase from its nadir ) and adiposity ( BMI , fat mass ) at age @ years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) .
METHODS	The sample consisted of @ children with AR derived in childhood and BMI and fat mass index ( FMI ; fat mass measured by dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry/height in m ( @ ) ) measured at @ years .
METHODS	Multivariable linear regression models were based on standardized residuals of log BMI and log FMI to allow comparison of regression coefficients across outcomes .
RESULTS	There were strong dose-response associations between timing of AR and both adiposity outcomes at @ years independent of confounders .
RESULTS	BMI was markedly higher in adolescence for those with very early AR ( by @ years ; = @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ ; P @ ) and was also higher for those with early AR ( between @ and @ years ; = @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; P = @ ) compared with those with later AR ( > @ years ) after full adjustment for a range of potential confounders .
RESULTS	Similar magnitudes of association were found for FMI after full adjustment for confounders ( compared with later AR : very early AR = @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; P @ ; early AR = @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Early AR is strongly associated with increased BMI and FMI in adolescence .
CONCLUSIONS	Preventive interventions should consider targeting modifiable factors in early childhood to delay timing of AR .

METHODS	Randomized clinical trial .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of functional stabilization training ( FST ) versus standard training on knee pain and function , lower-limb and trunk kinematics , trunk muscle endurance , and eccentric hip and knee muscle strength in women with patellofemoral pain .
BACKGROUND	A combination of hip - and knee-strengthening exercise may be more beneficial than quadriceps strengthening alone to improve pain and function in individuals with patellofemoral pain .
BACKGROUND	However , there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of these exercise programs on the biomechanics of the lower extremity .
METHODS	Thirty-one women were randomized to either the FST group or standard-training group .
METHODS	Patients attended a baseline assessment session , followed by an @-week intervention , and were reassessed at the end of the intervention and at @ months after the intervention .
METHODS	Assessment measures were a @-cm visual analog scale for pain , the Lower Extremity Functional Scale , and the single-leg triple-hop test .
METHODS	A global rating of change scale was used to measure perceived improvement .
METHODS	Kinematics were assessed during the single-leg squat .
METHODS	Outcome measures also included trunk endurance and eccentric hip and knee muscle strength assessment .
RESULTS	The patients in the FST group had less pain at the @-month follow-up and greater global improvement and physical function at the end of the intervention compared to those in the standard-training group .
RESULTS	Lesser ipsilateral trunk inclination , pelvis contralateral depression , hip adduction , and knee abduction , along with greater pelvis anteversion and hip flexion movement excursions during the single-leg squat , were only observed in the FST group after the intervention .
RESULTS	Only those in the FST group had greater eccentric hip abductor and knee flexor strength , as well as greater endurance of the anterior , posterior , and lateral trunk muscles , after training .
CONCLUSIONS	An intervention program consisting of hip muscle strengthening and lower-limb and trunk movement control exercises was more beneficial in improving pain , physical function , kinematics , and muscle strength compared to a program of quadriceps-strengthening exercises alone .

BACKGROUND	Everolimus and cyclosporine A ( CsA ) exhibit synergistic immunosuppressive activity when used in combination .
BACKGROUND	We examined the safety and efficacy of the use of everolimus with a cyclosporine-sparing strategy in de novo renal transplant recipients .
METHODS	A comparative , parallel , randomized , open-label @-year study has been performed in @ patients from five transplant centers to compare the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus and reduced exposure CsA ( the investigational group ) or enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium and standard-exposure CsA ( the control group ) in combination with basiliximab and steroids .
METHODS	The eligible subjects were randomly assigned at @ month after transplantation .
METHODS	Efficacy failure ( biopsy-proven acute rejection , death , graft loss , or loss to follow-up ) , safety , and renal function were evaluated .
RESULTS	One graft loss has been reported in the control group and no patient death were reported in either group .
RESULTS	The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection until @ months after transplantation of the investigational group was @ % , compared to @ % of the control group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean estimated glomerular filtration rates of the investigational group at @ months after transplantation was significantly higher ( @ @ ml/min/@ @ m ( @ ) ) than that of the control group ( @ @ ml/min/@ @ m ( @ ) ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference ( P > @ ) in the incidence of discontinuations and serious adverse events between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study provide the evidences that ( @ ) the calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) minimization by the introduction of everolimus after @-month posttransplantation keeps the incidences of acute rejection and additional risks as low as the conventional immunosuppression ; ( @ ) it allows minimizing CNI exposure , consequently reducing CNI nephrotoxicity and preserving renal function .

BACKGROUND	High-sensitivity troponin-I ( hs-TnI ) measurement improves risk assessment for cardiovascular events in many clinical settings , but the added value in atrial fibrillation patients has not been described .
RESULTS	At randomization , hs-TnI was analyzed in @ @ atrial fibrillation patients in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation ( ARISTOTLE ) trial comparing apixaban with warfarin .
RESULTS	The associations between hs-TnI concentrations and clinical outcomes were evaluated by using adjusted Cox analysis .
RESULTS	The hs-TnI assay detected troponin ( @ ng/L ) in @ % patients , @ % had levels > @ , @ % had levels > @ , and @ % had levels @ ng/L ( the @th percentile in healthy individuals ) .
RESULTS	During a median of @ years follow-up , annual rates of stroke or systemic embolism ranged from @ % in the lowest hs-TnI quartile to @ % in the highest quartile ( > @ ng/L ) .
RESULTS	In multivariable analysis , hs-TnI was significantly associated with stroke or systemic embolism , adjusted hazard ratio @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	hs-TnI was also significantly associated with cardiac death ; annual rates ranged from @ % to @ % , hazard ratio @ ( @-@ @ ) , P < @ , in the corresponding groups , and for major bleeding hazard ratio @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	Adding hs-TnI levels to the CHA@DS@VASc score improved c-statistics from @ to @ for stroke or systemic embolism , and from @ to @ for cardiac death .
RESULTS	There were no significant interactions with study treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Troponin-I is detected in @ % and elevated in @ % of atrial fibrillation patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The hs-TnI level is independently associated with a raised risk of stroke , cardiac death , and major bleeding and improves risk stratification beyond the CHA@DS@VASc score .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefits of apixaban in comparison with warfarin are consistent regardless of hs-TnI levels .

BACKGROUND	Heavy drinking among individuals with HIV is associated with major health concerns ( liver disease , medication nonadherence , immune functioning ) , but little is known about cognitive-motivational factors involved in alcohol consumption in this population , particularly reasons for limiting drinking .
METHODS	Urban HIV primary care patients ( N = @ ; @ % male ; @ % African American or Hispanic ) in a randomized trial of brief drinking-reduction interventions reported on reasons for limiting drinking , alcohol consumption , and alcohol dependence symptoms prior to intervention .
RESULTS	Exploratory factor analysis indicated @ main domains of reasons for limiting drinking : social reasons ( e.g. , responsibility to family ) , lifestyle reasons ( e.g. , religious/moral reasons ) , and impairment concerns ( e.g. , hangovers ) .
RESULTS	These factors evidenced good internal consistency ( s = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Higher scores on social reasons for limiting drinking were associated with lower typical quantity , maximum quantity , and binge frequency ( ps < @ ) , and higher scores on lifestyle reasons were associated with lower maximum quantity , binge frequency , and intoxication frequency ( ps < @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , higher scores on impairment concerns were associated with more frequent drinking and intoxication , and higher risk of alcohol dependence ( ps < @ ) , likely because dependent drinkers are more familiar with alcohol-induced impairment .
CONCLUSIONS	The current study is the first to explore reasons for limiting drinking among individuals with HIV and how these reasons relate to alcohol involvement .
CONCLUSIONS	This study yields a scale that can be used to assess reasons for limiting drinking among HIV-positive drinkers and provides information that can be used to enhance interventions with this population .
CONCLUSIONS	Discussing social and lifestyle reasons for limiting drinking among less extreme drinkers may support and validate these patients ' efforts to limit engagement in heavy drinking ; discussion of impairment reasons for limiting drinking may be a way to engage dependent drinkers in efforts to decrease their alcohol consumption .

BACKGROUND	Advanced type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) needing insulin therapy is common .
BACKGROUND	Most conventional anti-hyperglycemic drugs have limited efficacies and significant side effects , so that better anti-hyperglycemic agents are needed .
BACKGROUND	Urtica dioica L. ( nettle ) leaves have insulin secretagogue , PPARgamma agonistic , and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , nettle leaves are used in traditional medicine as an anti-hyperglycemic agent to treat diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	Thus , efficacy and safety of nettle in the treatment of patients with advanced type @ diabetes mellitus needing insulin were studied .
METHODS	In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial , we evaluated the effects of taking nettle leaf extract ( one @ mg capsule every @ hours for @ months ) combined with the conventional oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs on the blood levels of fasting glucose , postprandial glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA@c ) , creatinine and liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT , and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in @ patients and compared with the placebo group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	At the endpoint , the extract lowered the blood levels of fasting glucose , @ hours postprandial glucose , and HbA@c significantly ( p < @ , p = @ , and p = @ , respectively ) without any significant effects on the other parameters ( p > @ ) compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Nettle may safely improve glycemic control in type @ diabetic patients needing insulin therapy .

BACKGROUND	In addition to their effects on bone health , high doses of cholecalciferol may have beneficial non-classic effects including the reduction of incidence of type @ diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease , and cancer .
BACKGROUND	These pleiotropic effects have been documented in observational and experimental studies or in small intervention trials .
BACKGROUND	Vitamin D insufficiency is a frequent finding in renal transplant recipients ( RTRs ) , and this population is at risk of the previously cited complications .
METHODS	The VITALE study is a prospective , multicentre , double-blind , randomized , controlled trial with two parallel groups that will include a total of @ RTRs .
METHODS	RTRs with vitamin D insufficiency , defined as circulating @-hydroxyvitamin D levels of less than @ ng/ml ( or @ nmol/l ) , will be randomized between @ and @ months after transplantation to blinded groups to receive vitamin D@ ( cholecalciferol ) either at high or low dose ( respectively , @,@ UI or @,@ UI every @ weeks for @ months then monthly for @ months ) with a follow-up of @ years .
METHODS	The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of high-dose versus low-dose cholecalciferol on a composite endpoint consisting of de novo diabetes mellitus ; major cardiovascular events ; de novo cancer ; and patient death .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints will include blood pressure ( BP ) control ; echocardiography findings ; the incidences of infection and acute rejection episodes ; renal allograft function using estimated glomerular filtration rate ; proteinuria ; graft survival ; bone mineral density ; the incidence of fractures ; and biological relevant parameters of mineral metabolism .
CONCLUSIONS	We previously reported that the intensive cholecalciferol treatment ( @ @ IU every @ weeks for @ months ) was safe in RTR .
CONCLUSIONS	Using a pharmacokinetic approach , we showed that cholecalciferol @,@ IU monthly should maintain serum @-hydroxyvitamin D at above @ ng/ml but below @ ng/ml after renal transplantation .
CONCLUSIONS	Taken together , these results are reassuring regarding the safety of the cholecalciferol doses that will be used in the VITALE study .
CONCLUSIONS	Analysis of data collected during the VITALE study will demonstrate whether high or low-dose cholecalciferol is beneficial in RTRs with vitamin D insufficiency .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of @ different polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) doses for the maintenance treatment of functional constipation in children .
METHODS	Children with functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to receive PEG @ at a dose of either @ g/kg ( high-dose group ; n = @ ) or @ g/kg ( low-dose group ; n = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Adjustment of the therapy was recommended in the event of < @ bowel movements ( BM ) per week or @ BM per day .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was treatment success , defined as @ BM per week with no fecal soiling during the last week of the intervention .
RESULTS	A total of @ of @ randomized children , with a mean age of @ years , completed the study .
RESULTS	In the analysis based on allocated treatment , treatment success was similar in both groups ( relative risk @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the high-dose PEG group , the low-dose PEG group had an increased need for therapy adjustment of borderline significance ( relative risk @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) , an increased risk of painful defecation , a lower number of stools per week , and lower parental satisfaction .
RESULTS	Adverse events were similar in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	To achieve treatment success , both tested doses of PEG were equally safe and effective in the treatment of children with functional constipation .

OBJECTIVE	We sought to assess the prognostic role of collaterals in a large population of patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) .
METHODS	The coronary collateral circulation was assessed by an independent angiographic core laboratory using the Rentrop Score in patients enrolled in the randomised Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy trial .
RESULTS	The cohort comprised @ patients with moderate to high risk ACS .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) had visible collaterals while @ patients ( @ % ) had no collaterals .
RESULTS	After multivariable adjustment , there were no differences in clinical outcomes at @ year between the groups , including major adverse cardiac events ( MACE ) ( HR @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) , p = @ ) , mortality ( HR @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( HR @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ) and unplanned target vessel revascularisation ( TVR ) ( HR @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , in the subgroup of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , the adjusted HR for major adverse cardiac events was @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ; @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ for mortality ; and @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ for MI .
RESULTS	The risk of unplanned TVR was increased ( HR @ ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast to other studies , this large core laboratory-based analysis does not confirm a beneficial role of visible coronary collateral vessels on clinical outcomes in patients with ACS ; the presence of collaterals was even associated with increased mortality in the unadjusted analysis .
CONCLUSIONS	Collaterals were associated with a higher risk of TVR in patients undergoing PCI , a finding that may not have been fully corrected given confounders and clinical differences between the groups .

METHODS	In this prospective study , @ patients with prominent ears were included in the study .
METHODS	In Group @ , @ ears of @ patients ( @ bilateral and @ unilateral ) were operated with Haytoglu et al. 's modification of incisionless otoplasty technique .
METHODS	In Group @ , @ ears of @ patients ( @ bilateral and @ unilateral ) were operated with Fritsch 's incisionless otoplasty technique .
METHODS	For comparison of two methods , auriculocephalic distances were measured at three levels which were level @ ( the most superior point of the auricle ) , level @ ( the midpoint of the auricle ) and level @ ( level of the lobule ) pre-operatively ( preop ) ; and measurements were repeated at the end of the surgery ( PO ( @-day ) ) , @st month ( PO ( @-Mo ) ) and @th month ( PO ( @-Mo ) ) after the surgery , in both groups .
METHODS	Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	Moreover , Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale ( GAIS ) was rated by an independent , non-participating plastic surgeon at @ months after the surgery .
RESULTS	Operation time was @ min in Group @ ( Haytoglu et al. 's ) and @ min in Group @ ( Fritsch ) .
RESULTS	Hematoma , infection , bleeding , keloid scar formation , sharp edges or irregularities of the cartilage were not observed in any group .
RESULTS	Suture extrusion was detected in @ % of Group @ and @ % of Group @ .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference was observed between auriculocephalic distances at levels @-@ of groups at preop , PO ( @-day ) , PO ( @-Mo ) and PO ( @-Mo ) separately .
RESULTS	Similarly , difference in auriculocephalic distances ( preop values-PO ( @-Mo ) values ) was not detected as statistically significant in Groups @ and @ at three levels .
RESULTS	In both techniques , No statistically significant difference was observed in patient satisfaction at @th months after the operation which was measured using Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) on @ to @ scales .
RESULTS	According to GAIS , the patients were rated as @ % `` improved '' and @ % `` no change '' in Group @ ; as @ % `` improved '' and @ % `` no change '' in Group @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to the similar results , Haytoglu et al. 's and Fritsch 's incisionless otoplasty techniques are good options in the treatment of prominent ears , especially in pediatric patients with isolated inadequate development of antihelical ridge , and with soft auricular cartilage .

METHODS	At each session , subjects were fitted with a nonrebreathing mask and breathed room air for @ minutes ( acclimation period ) , @ % N@O :@ % O@ for @ minutes ( experimental period ) , and @ % O@ for @ minutes ( recovery period ) .
METHODS	Throughout , heart rate , blood pressure , and O@ saturation were monitored , and bilateral middle ear pressures were recorded by tympanometry every minute .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the slope of the middle ear pressure-time function for the experimental period , which estimates the volume N@O exchange rate .
METHODS	Using repeated measures analysis of variance , the effects of group ( disease history ) , treatment ( active vs. placebo ) , and period ( @ vs. @ ) on the recorded vital signs , and of group , treatment , and ear ( left/right ) on the middle ear pressure-time slope were evaluated for statistical significance .
RESULTS	Statistically significant effects of period on O@ saturation ( period @ > period @ ) and of treatment on heart rate ( active > placebo ) were documented .
RESULTS	Only treatment was statistically significant for the middle ear pressure-time slope , with a shallower slope characterizing the active treatment session .
CONCLUSIONS	The volume exchange rate across the middle ear mucosa of perfusion-limited gases can be modulated pharmacologically .
CONCLUSIONS	Theoretically , similar drugs can be used to reduce the requisite eustachian tube opening efficiency for adequate middle ear pressure regulation .

OBJECTIVE	Pain attitudes and beliefs are hypothesized to influence pain and adjustment to pain .
OBJECTIVE	Valid and reliable measures of these beliefs are necessary to test their hypothesized associations with outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	The Pediatric version of the Survey of Pain Attitudes ( Peds-SOPA ) is a new measure with limited evidence regarding its psychometric properties .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to : @ ) evaluate the predictive validity , reliability , and factor structure of the Peds-SOPA ; and @ ) determine if there are sex - or age-related differences in children 's attitudes toward pain .
METHODS	Longitudinal study .
METHODS	Five hundred and sixty-one schoolchildren between @ and @ years old participated in this study .
RESULTS	Factor analyses supported the seven-factor structure described by the original authors .
RESULTS	The Peds-SOPA showed acceptable reliability with Cronbach alpha values ranging from @ to @ .
RESULTS	The Peds-SOPA scales also demonstrated prospective predictive validity via their associations with pain intensity , and pain status at @-year follow-up .
RESULTS	The findings also showed some few sex - and age-specific differences in the Peds-SOPA scores .
CONCLUSIONS	The current findings provide additional support for the reliability and validity of the Peds-SOPA , and suggest that children 's pain attitudes and beliefs might be important intervention targets in pain treatment .

BACKGROUND	This is the third study in a Phase @ program evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of crow 's feet lines ( CFL ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy and safety of repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatments of CFL alone or with glabellar lines ( GL ) in subjects with moderate-to-severe CFL and GL ( maximum smile ) .
METHODS	This @-month extension of a @-month study randomized subjects who originally received onabotulinumtoxinA @ U ( CFL only ; n = @ ) or @ U ( @ U for CFL + @ U for GL ; n = @ ) to retreatment with the same dose .
METHODS	Placebo-treated subjects were rerandomized to onabotulinumtoxinA @ U ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Primary efficacy end point ( Day @ ) was the proportion of subjects who achieved a CFL severity rating of none or mild ( maximum smile ) on the investigator-assessed Facial Wrinkle Scale ( FWS ) .
METHODS	Additional efficacy end points and adverse events were evaluated .
RESULTS	Responder rates ( primary end point ) were significantly greater in onabotulinumtoxinA-treated groups ( @ U : @ % ; @ U : @ % ; placebo : @ % ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Improvements on most patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) favored the @-U group over the @-U group .
RESULTS	Adverse events did not differ among groups ; most were mild or moderate .
CONCLUSIONS	Repeated onabotulinumtoxinA treatments significantly reduce CFL severity based on FWS and PROs .
CONCLUSIONS	Adverse event profiles remain consistent with approved GL labeling .

BACKGROUND	There is a major unmet need for effective treatments in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .
BACKGROUND	LUX-Lung @ compared afatinib ( an irreversible ErbB family blocker ) with erlotinib ( a reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) , as second-line treatment for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .
METHODS	We did this open-label , phase @ randomised controlled trial at @ cancer centres in @ countries worldwide .
METHODS	We enrolled adults with stage IIIB or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who had progressed after at least four cycles of platinum-based-chemotherapy .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive afatinib ( @ mg per day ) or erlotinib ( @ mg per day ) until disease progression .
METHODS	The randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web-based response system and stratified by ethnic origin ( eastern Asian vs non-eastern Asian ) .
METHODS	Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by independent central review ( intention-to-treat population ) .
METHODS	The key secondary endpoint was overall survival .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ eligible patients were randomly assigned ( @ to afatinib , @ to erlotinib ) .
RESULTS	Median follow-up at the time of the primary analysis of progression-free survival was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , at which point enrolment was not complete .
RESULTS	Progression free-survival at the primary analysis was significantly longer with afatinib than with erlotinib ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	At the time of the primary analysis of overall survival ( median follow-up @ months -LSB- IQR @-@ -RSB- ) , overall survival was significantly greater in the afatinib group than in the erloinib group ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) , as were progression-free survival ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; HR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) and disease control ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ patients vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- of @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Tumour shrinkage occurred in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients versus @ ( @ % ) of @ patients .
RESULTS	Adverse event profiles were similar in each group : @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the afatinib group versus @ ( @ % ) of @ in the erlotinib group had grade @ or higher adverse events .
RESULTS	We recorded higher incidences of treatment-related grade @ diarrhoea with afatinib ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs nine -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , of grade @ stomatitis with afatinib ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs none ) , and of grade @ rash or acne with erlotinib ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival with afatinib compared with erlotinib , along with a manageable safety profile and the convenience of oral administration suggest that afatinib could be an additional option for the treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .

OBJECTIVE	Physicians adopt evidence-based guidelines with variable consistency .
OBJECTIVE	Narratives , or stories , offer a novel dissemination strategy for clinical recommendations .
OBJECTIVE	The study objective was to compare whether evidence-based narrative versus traditional summary improved recall of opioid prescribing guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians ( ACEP ) .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized controlled experiment to compare whether narrative versus summary promoted short-term recall of six themes contained in the ACEP opioid guideline .
METHODS	The experiment was modeled after the free-recall test , an established technique in studies of memory .
METHODS	At a regional conference , emergency physicians ( EPs ) were randomized to read either a summary of the guideline ( control ) or a narrative ( intervention ) .
METHODS	The fictional narrative was constructed to match the summary in content and length .
METHODS	One hour after reading the text , participants listed all content that they could recall .
METHODS	Two reviewers independently scored the responses to assess recall of the six themes .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the total number of themes recalled per participant .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included the proportion of responses in each study arm that recalled individual themes and the proportion of responses in each arm that contained falsely recalled or extraneous information .
RESULTS	Ninety-five physicians were randomized .
RESULTS	Eighty-two physicians completed the experiment , for a response rate of @ % .
RESULTS	The mean of the total number of themes recalled per participant was @ in the narrative arm versus @ in the summary arm ( difference = @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	For three themes , the proportion of responses that recalled the theme was significantly greater in the narrative arm compared to the summary arm , with the differences ranging from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	For one theme , recall was significantly greater in the summary arm .
RESULTS	For two themes , there was no statistically significant difference in recall between the arms .
RESULTS	In the summary arm , @ % of responses were found to contain falsely recalled or extraneous information versus @ % of responses in the narrative arm ( difference = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Physicians exposed to a narrative about opioid guidelines were more likely to recall guideline content at @ hour than those exposed to a summary of the guidelines .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should examine whether the incorporation of narratives in dissemination campaigns improves guideline adoption and changes clinical practice

OBJECTIVE	Paullinia cupana ( guaran ) is an Amazonian plant that has been previously shown to be effective in treating chemotherapy-related fatigue ( CRF ) in patients with breast cancer .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a purified dry extract of P. cupana ( PC-@ ) in patients with various solid tumors treated with chemotherapy .
METHODS	We included @ patients with solid tumors who showed increases in their Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) questionnaire scores after @ week of systemic chemotherapy .
METHODS	PC-@ was administered at @ mg by mouth two times per day ( PO bid ) , starting after @ week of chemotherapy , for @ weeks ( induction phase ) .
METHODS	Patients who had an improvement in or stabilization of their BFI scores were randomized to receive either PC-@ at the same dose or placebo for the following @ weeks ( maintenance phase ) .
RESULTS	After PC-@ treatment , the BFI fatigue scores improved or stabilized in @ out of the @ patients ( mean BFI score difference = @ ; @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Three weeks after randomization ( @ patients on PC-@ and @ on placebo ) , we observed no significant differences in the BFI , Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores between patients randomized to PC-@ versus placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that the PC-@ extract may be effective for the treatment of CRF in patients with a variety of solid tumors .
CONCLUSIONS	A conditioning effect , which was observed in patients who had a beneficial effect of PC-@ on CRF , may explain the better than expected fatigue scores of the placebo-treated patients .

BACKGROUND	A single session of left prefrontal rTMS has been shown to have analgesic effects , and to reduce post-operative morphine use .
BACKGROUND	We sought to test these findings in a larger sample , and try and see if multiple sessions had additive analgesic benefit .
METHODS	@ patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery received two sessions of @ Hz rTMS ( @ % of motor threshold ) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( one immediately following surgery and one @ h later ) .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to receive @ sessions of real rTMS , @ sessions of sham , @ real then @ sham , or @ sham then @ real rTMS treatments .
METHODS	Patients and study staff were blind to rTMS conditions .
RESULTS	Unlike previous rTMS trials for post-operative pain , no differences emerged between groups with respect to total patient-controlled analgesia usage ( IV hydromorphone ) .
RESULTS	However , despite no difference in IV analgesic usage , subjects that received @ real rTMS sessions rated both the affective and sensory dimensions of their pain significantly lower than those in the shamsham group at several time points during the post-surgical/post-rTMS period .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that left prefrontal rTMS may produce significant analgesic effects in the perioperative setting .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further work is needed to understand this effect and attempt to make it clinically useful in light of the lack of effect on PCA hydromorphone use .

OBJECTIVE	Increasing physical activity is an important public-health goal worldwide , but there are few published mediation analyses of physical-activity interventions in low-to-middle-income countries like South Africa undergoing a health transition involving markedly increased mortality from non-communicable diseases .
OBJECTIVE	This article reports secondary analyses on the mediation of a theory-of-planned-behavior-based behavioral intervention that increased self-reported physical activity in a trial with @ men in Eastern Cape Province , South Africa .
METHODS	Twenty-two matched-pairs of neighborhoods were randomly selected .
METHODS	Within pairs , neighborhoods were randomized to a health-promotion intervention or an attention-matched control intervention with baseline , immediate-post , and @ - and @-month post-intervention assessments .
METHODS	Theory-of-planned-behavior constructs measured immediately post-intervention were tested as potential mediators of the primary outcome , self-reported physical activity averaged over the @ - and @-month post-intervention assessments , using a product-of-coefficients approach in a generalized-estimating-equations framework .
METHODS	Data were collected in @-@ .
RESULTS	Attitude , subjective norm , self-efficacy , and intention were significant mediators of intervention-induced increases in self-reported physical activity .
RESULTS	The descriptive norm , not affected by the intervention , was not a mediator , but predicted increased self-reported physical activity .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that interventions targeting theory-of-planned-behavior constructs may contribute to efforts to increase physical activity to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases among South African men .

OBJECTIVE	To optimize the therapeutic programs for periarthritis of shoulder treated with acupuncture , moxibustion and kinetohterapy with orthogonal design method adopted .
METHODS	The orthogonal design table of L@ ( @ ( @ ) ) hierarchical principle was used to randomly divide @ patients of periarthritis of shoulder into @ groups , @ cases in each one .
METHODS	Separately , @ factors and each different @ levels were adopted in treatment , named acupuncture timing ( factor A : A , acute stage , A@ adhesion stage ) , acupoint combination ( factor B : B , local acupoints , B@ local acupoints and distal acupoints along meridians ) , filiform needling and warm needling therapy ( factor C : C@ acupuncture with filiform needle , CZ acupuncture with filiform needle and warm needling therapy ) and positive functional exercise ( factor D : D@ without positive functional exercise , D@ with positive functional exercise ) .
METHODS	The treatment was given once a day , @ treatments made one session and @ sessions were required totally .
METHODS	The time points of observation were the point after @ session of treatment and after @ sessions of treatment .
METHODS	The short-form McGill pain questionnaire ( MPQ ) and shoulder joint motor disturbance score were adopted for evaluation .
RESULTS	In the orthogonal design analysis , taking the hierarchical factors into consideration , the age was considered as the main factor in the evaluation of shoulder pain and shoulder motor disturbance ( P < @ ) , and the shoulder function grade apparently impacted pain evaluation and the efficacy on shoulder motor disturbance ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The best combination of @ factors and @ levels were A@B@CzD@ and A@ BC@D@ .
RESULTS	SAS statistical analysis showed that at acute stage and adhesion stage , CZ Dz , meaning acupuncture with fifiform needling and warm needling therapy combined with positive functional exercise , is the main factor of the improvements of shoulder motor function ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	For periarthritis of shoulder at acute stage , the combined therapy of acupuncture at local acupoints , warm needling and positive functional exercise is adopted .
CONCLUSIONS	At chronic stage , the combined therapy of acupuncture at local acupoints and distal acupoints , acupuncture with filiform needle and warm needling and positive functional exercise is the best program .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , in clinical treatment , the patients ' age , sex , shoulder joint function and duration of treatment should be considered comprehensively for the impacts on the efficacy .

BACKGROUND	Inappropriate drug use has been identified as one of the most important problems affecting the quality of care in older people .
BACKGROUND	Inappropriate drug use may increase the risk of the occurrence of ` geriatric giants ' such as immobility , instability , incontinence and cognitive impairment .
BACKGROUND	There are indications that clinical medication reviews ( CMR ) can reduce inappropriate drug use .
BACKGROUND	However , CMRs have not yet been implemented at a large scale in primary care .
BACKGROUND	An innovative medication review program in primary care will be developed which tackles the most important obstacles for a large scale implementation of CMRs .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to assess whether this CMR program is ( cost - ) effective compared with usual general practice care for older patients with geriatric symptoms with regard to quality of life and geriatric symptoms .
METHODS	A cluster randomised controlled trial will be performed in @ Dutch general practices including @ patients .
METHODS	Patients of @years and older are eligible if they newly present with pre-specified geriatric symptoms in general practice and chronic use of at least one prescribed drug .
METHODS	GP practices will be stratified by practice size and randomly allocated to control ( n = @ ) or intervention group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The intervention consists of CMRs which will be facilitated and prepared by an expert team consisting of a GP and a pharmacist .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures are patient 's quality of life and the presence of self-reported geriatric symptoms during a follow-up period of @months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes are costs of healthcare utilisation , feasibility , number of drug related problems , medication adherence and satisfaction with medication .
CONCLUSIONS	This study is expected to add evidence on the ( cost - ) effectiveness of an optimally facilitated , prepared and structured CMR in comparison with usual care in older patients who present a geriatric symptom to their GP .
CONCLUSIONS	The strength of this study is that it will be conducted in daily clinical practice .
CONCLUSIONS	This improves the possibilities to implement the CMRs in the primary care setting on a large scale .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety and efficacy of various initial strategies of loop diuretic administration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) on diuresis , renal function , electrolyte balance and clinical outcomes .
METHODS	Consecutive patients admitted with ADHF were randomized into three groups - intravenous furosemide infusion + intravenous dopamine , intravenous furosemide bolus in two divided doses and intravenous furosemide continuous infusion alone .
METHODS	At @h , the treating physician could adjust the diuretic strategy .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was negative fluid balance at @h after admission .
METHODS	Secondary end points were duration of hospital stay , negative fluid balance at @ , @ , @h , the trend of serum electrolytes , and renal function and @ day clinical outcome ( death and emergency department visits ) .
RESULTS	Overall ninety patients ( thirty in each group ) were included in the study .
RESULTS	There was a greater diuresis in first @h ( p = @ ) and a shorter hospital stay ( p = @ ) with the bolus group .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in renal function and serum sodium and serum potassium levels .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the number of emergency department visits among the three groups .
CONCLUSIONS	All three modes of diuretic therapies can be practiced with no difference in worsening of renal function and electrolyte levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Bolus dose administration with itsrapid volume loss and shorter hospital stay might be a more effective diuretic strategy .

BACKGROUND	Missed scheduled HIV appointments lead to increased mortality , resistance to antiretroviral therapy , and suboptimum virological response .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether reminders sent to carers by text message , mobile phone call , or concomitant text message and mobile phone call increase attendance at medical appointments for HIV care in a population of children infected with or exposed to HIV in Cameroon .
BACKGROUND	We also aimed to ascertain the most cost-effective method of mobile-phone-based reminder .
METHODS	MORE CARE was a multicentre , single-blind , factorial , randomised controlled trial in urban , semi-urban , and rural settings in Cameroon .
METHODS	Carers of children who were infected with or had been exposed to HIV were randomly assigned electronically in blocks of four and allocated ( @:@:@:@ ) sequentially to receive a text message and a call , a text message only , a call only , or no reminder ( control ) .
METHODS	Investigators were masked to group assignment .
METHODS	Text messages were sent and calls made @ or @ days before a scheduled follow-up appointment .
METHODS	The primary outcomes were efficacy ( the proportion of patients attending a previously scheduled appointment ) and efficiency ( attendance / -LSB- measures of staff working time cost of the reminders -RSB- ) , as a measure of cost-effectiveness .
METHODS	The primary analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This study is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Register , number PACTR@ .
RESULTS	The study took place between Jan @ and May @ , @ .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned @ adult-child ( carer-patient ) pairs into four groups : text message plus call ( n = @ ) , call ( n = @ ) , text message ( n = @ ) , and control ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ participants ( @ % ) in the text message plus call group , @ ( @ % ) in the call group , @ ( @ % ) in the text message group , and @ ( @ % ) in the control group attended their scheduled appointment .
RESULTS	Compared with control , the odds ratios for improvement in the primary efficacy outcome were @ ( @ % CI @-@ ; p < @ ) for text message plus call , @ ( @-@ ; p = @ ) for call , and @ ( @-@ ; p = @ ) for text message .
RESULTS	No significant differences were seen in comparisons of the three intervention groups with each other , and there was no synergism between text messages and calls .
RESULTS	For the primary efficiency outcome , the mean difference for text message versus text message plus call was @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) , for call versus text message plus call was @ ( @ to @ ; p < @ ) , and for call versus text message was @ ( -@ to @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mobile-phone-based reminders of scheduled HIV appointments for carers of paediatric patients in low-resource settings can increase attendance .
CONCLUSIONS	The most effective method of reminder was text message plus phone call , but text messaging alone was the most efficient ( ie , cost-effective ) method .

BACKGROUND	Safe and cost-effective programs for implementing early infant male circumcision ( EIMC ) in Africa need to be piloted .
BACKGROUND	We present results on a relative cost analysis within a randomized noninferiority trial of EIMC comparing the AccuCirc device with Mogen clamp in Zimbabwe .
METHODS	Between January and June @ , male infants who met inclusion criteria were randomized to EIMC through either AccuCirc or Mogen clamp conducted by a doctor , using a @:@ allocation ratio .
METHODS	We evaluated the overall unit cost plus the key cost drivers of EIMC using both AccuCirc and Mogen clamp .
METHODS	Direct costs included consumable and nonconsumable supplies , device , personnel , associated staff training , and environmental costs .
METHODS	Indirect costs comprised capital and support personnel costs .
METHODS	In @-way sensitivity analyses , we assessed potential changes in unit costs due to variations in main parameters , one at a time , holding all other values constant .
RESULTS	The unit costs of EIMC using AccuCirc and Mogen clamp were $ @ and $ @ , respectively .
RESULTS	Key cost drivers were consumable supplies , capacity utilization , personnel costs , and device price .
RESULTS	Unit prices are likely to be lowest at full capacity utilization and increase as capacity utilization decreases .
RESULTS	Unit prices also fall with lower personnel salaries and increase with higher device prices .
CONCLUSIONS	EIMC has a lower unit cost when using AccuCirc compared with Mogen clamp .
CONCLUSIONS	To minimize unit costs , countries planning to scale-up EIMC using AccuCirc need to control costs of consumables and personnel .
CONCLUSIONS	There is also need to negotiate a reasonable device price and maximize capacity utilization .

BACKGROUND	A number of perioperative risk factors may suppress the immune system and contribute to the development of post-operative complications .
BACKGROUND	The association between surgical site infection ( SSI ) and other wound-related complications resulting from immunosuppression through either perioperative administration of dexamethasone , pre-operative smoking or alcohol abuse is , however , uncertain .
METHODS	This study was a post hoc analysis of data from the PROXI randomized trial in @ patients who underwent emergency or elective laparotomy .
METHODS	We assessed the associations of use of dexamethasone , smoking status and alcohol abuse with the primary outcome , being a composite of SSI , anastomotic leak , wound dehiscence , burst abdomen and @-day mortality .
RESULTS	The primary outcome occurred in @ % of patients receiving dexamethasone versus @ % of patients not receiving dexamethasone , and this was not statistically significant when adjusting for stratification variables originally used in the PROXI trial -LSB- OR @ , @ % CI ( @-@ @ ) -RSB- .
RESULTS	In smokers , the primary outcome occurred in @ % , compared with @ % of non-smokers ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Smokers also had a higher frequency of SSI ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) and burst abdomen ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In alcohol abusers , the primary outcome occurred in @ % , compared with @ % in patients who did not abuse alcohol ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Burst abdomen occurred more commonly in alcohol abusers ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Perioperative administration of dexamethasone was not significantly associated with SSI or other wound-related complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Conversely , smoking and alcohol abuse were both significant predictors of the primary outcome consisting of wound-related complications and mortality .

BACKGROUND	While research suggests primary prescription opioid ( PO ) abusers may exhibit less severe demographic and drug use characteristics than primary heroin abusers , less is known about whether a lifetime history of heroin use confers greater severity among PO abusers .
OBJECTIVE	In this secondary analysis , we examined demographic and drug use characteristics as a function of lifetime heroin use among @ PO-dependent adults screened for a trial evaluating the relative efficacy of buprenorphine taper durations .
OBJECTIVE	Exploratory analyses also examined contribution of lifetime heroin use to treatment response among a subset of participants who received a uniform set of study procedures .
METHODS	Baseline characteristics were compared between participants reporting lifetime heroin use @ ( H ( + ) ; n = @ ) vs. < @ ( H ( - ) ; n = @ ) times .
METHODS	Treatment response ( i.e. , illicit opioid abstinence and treatment retention at end of study ) was examined in the subset of H ( + ) and H ( - ) participants randomized to receive the @-week taper condition ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	H ( + ) participants were significantly older and more likely to be male .
RESULTS	They reported longer durations of illicit opioid use , greater alcohol-related problems , more past-month cocaine use , greater lifetime IV drug use , and greater lifetime use of cigarettes , amphetamines and hallucinogens .
RESULTS	H ( + ) participants also had lower scores on the Positive Symptom Distress and Depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory .
RESULTS	Finally , there was a trend toward poorer treatment outcomes among H ( + ) participants .
CONCLUSIONS	A lifetime history of heroin use may be associated with elevated drug severity and unique treatment needs among treatment-seeking PO abusers .
